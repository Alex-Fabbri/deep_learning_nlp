1	French like turkeys even the yanks eat turkeys. What has a turkey got to do with the French voting No! By the way, why do you spell turkey with a capital T?	The topic did not change. The topic was the reasons for the French no vote which certain posters originally claimed was a vote against Chirac, and when I asked them to back it up with evidence. The only 'evidence' they could cite was that commentators said that, so it was so. When I said that I heard commentators saying that Turkey and fears of globalisation were the main reasons for the French no vote, then the same posters who had earlier claimed that the French no vote was a vote against Chirac now changed their tune and said Turkey and fears of globalisation were reasons as well. So please keep with the thread of this disucussion will you. I know its hard work for you but try to remember how this topic got started in the first place.
1	I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds.	So far there is no mechanism for an organism to grow wings when it previously had none.
0	then where do rights come from and how do you know they exist? i commented on the part i felt needed to be commented on.	anything granted is not a right, things that are granted are priviledges.
1	Very impressive how you argue science. Are your arguments science, or are they anger? When Dawkins argues it with his above statement, that Darwinism is as all-encompassing as God is stated to be in the Bible, is it really science, or is it religion?	I could claim that you sexually violate chickens…The absolute absurdity of this guys arguments is stunning and perfectly deserving of unabashed taunting....BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!.....Listen, marcky marc
0	I think its actually the states job...the judiciary does need to overturn Roe v. Wade to get this done though...which doesn't mean it becomes illegal.	It's ashame that everyone keeps looking for the judiciary to do the legislature's work. When will the people press Congress to take up abortion? It is the job of Congress after all, to address the issues desired by it's constituents.
0	And I think that if I fall off a tall cliff, I'll die. Does that mean that gravity and science are either evil or incorrect?	( Now remember, people actually thought this way in the name of evolution and science!)
0	oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you "think" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.	Rubbish, there are many that argue otherwise. The life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.
0	yeah even i have to agree you were making a joke. i may not agree with your stances on things, but i can see when you're joking.	and some people have no sense of humor and take everything way too seriously... which i find pathetic.... just sayin'
0	again, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. Please show me where it is anything than a belief. Evolution was always considered science. It used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. Until the "theory" of intelligent design does that, I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief.	If I would have been alive 100 years ago, would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools? Of course I would have, because I wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance.
1	I have an avatar? And I wasn't born in 1990. Remember what the say about assumptions...	He is a teenager he will learn. Teenagers are often very opinionated about subects they know little about. Look at his avatar it is from the recient move fantastic 4 that should give you some clue to his maturity level. Also look at his profile it gives his birthdate July 31, 1990 he just turned 15.
1	i can't help it if fairy tales are dear to your heart dude, i'm just telling it like it is.  christians all over the country try to claim the gospels are in harmony..and very rarely , if ever, have i found a christian who will admit the contradictions in the bible. they try to explain away contradictions with lies and made up versions of their own but will never admit the truth.... no loss here, i have never since i came here hid the fact i do not like religion. it's nothing personal against anyone in particular, but if you happen to be religious and fall under the weight of truth i can't help if your feelings get hurt. would you rather me feed you a line of xxxx so you will fall for it, i mean come on, religion already did that right>.....emoticonxbouncer	i've hardly ever heard any christian try to convince anyone they are all consistent and harmonized. and i've been around a lot of christians. maybe you'd actually get more christians to consider your points if you'd stop flinging accusations of scams and rudely calling things that are dear to them 'fairy tales'. but hey, it's your loss.
0	They are merely taking chemicals that they can detect in outer space and reproducing the enviroment they are found in, by exposing them to ultraviolet. You are exposed to ultraviolet when you walk outside in the sunshine.Every chemical that they used is readily detected in interstellar molecular clouds.	In these experiments posted the scientist are stimulating the simulated environmet with chemicals.

1	Well, the pill has the ability to not let it implant, which "God" already cause for around 60% of its contemporaries. The pill doesn't destroy the "entity" at all.	The morning after pill has the potential to destroy that unique post-conception human entity. Regardless of whether it's right or wrong in somebody's eyes does not change the truth written above.
1	Lemme guess, in real life you're a lawyer, correct? You must be because you're extremely hypertechnical to the point of absurdity. It doesn't matter what you call them, be it criminal or gang member of dope dealer or home invader, if somebody breaks the law then they're a criminal and it's as simple as that.Seriously dude, you're trying to get off on a technicality here. Like a lawyer trying to argue "Your honor my client isn't a prostitute, she's a female escort". Doesn't matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as, a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is.So which is Ripskar, do criminals have guns and are likely to shoot you in the face and kill you, or do they not have guns at all. It's one or the other, it can't be both.	are a subset of criminals (ie not all criminals are burglars or muggers). Ripskar pointed out that gangs (criminals, but not necessarily burglars or muggers) tend to have guns. He also stated that burglars and muggers tend not to have guns.
1	Confucius, that is one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble that has ever been manufactured.	*NOTE*: THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK AT STOMACH :*NOTE*Just read...Dear Mommy, I am in Heaven now, sitting on Jesus' lap. He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to be your little girl. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existance. I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. That same day, the most horrible thing happened. A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. I was so scared, I began screaming, but you never once tried to help me. Maybe you never heard me. The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, "Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me." Complete terror is all I felt. I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. Then the monster started ripping my arms off. It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. Though I was in such complete pain, I was dying. I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. I wanted to make all your tears go away. I had so many plans to make you happy. Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. I wanted more than anything to be your daughter. No use now, for I was dying a painful death. I could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead.I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. The angel took me to Jesus and set me on His lap. He said He loved me, and He was my Father. Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, "Abortion. I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels." I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster. I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to live. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to die. Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. Mommy, I love you and I would hate for you to go through the kind of pain I did. Please be careful. Love,Your Baby Girlhttp://wajclan.topcities.com/abortion/abortion.html
0	My life was a gift from my parents, no more, no less. When i look in the mirror, i do not see an embryo. If someone gives you something, they have every right to take it away if they feel you are not suited to handle it, or if they had second thoughts. I would think this was ok if the baby was stopped in an earlier stage, but once its in its third trimester, you have no right to kill it.	mercy and killing should never be put together.there is no such thing as having so much compassion that justifies you putting a toddler to death. Dont people realize that children are gifts and not something that should be taken so lightly as to steep so low in stopping a beating heart all for the sake of selfishness and convenience for one's self.. There is absolutely no thought whatsoever in the baby, its all about "how can i live easier without this problem?".there is no such thing as compassionate killing. What it really means is "killing in the name of mercy for my comfort".people need to start realizing that the world doesnt revolve around them and that life itself is a gift TO ALL! EVEN THOSE LITTLE ONES THAT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THINK DONT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO LIVE. look in the mirror!
1	Here is yet another example of Duo holding other people's arguments to a higher standard than he holds his own. Duo, you said "Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity." Are you right? Anyone claiming to know age on these boards without evidence is insanity? Duo, if you are right, you are calling yourself insane. That's not going to help you out on the credibility meter. Perhaps you might want to amend some of you posts?	That doesn't make sense. How can a 13 year old have served in the military for 46 years?Here's the full post
1	You apparently know as much about law as you do about science. You wouldn't be arrested for having someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant was a controlled substance and last time I checked, poppy and weed weren't cancer cures.	.and that's because the medical establishment has made it illegal to treat any disease in this country with anything other than FDA approved drugs or surgery. It's all about the money, man.
0	Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened.	5) Show me one instance of an evolutionist (any book, any website) admitting that “evolution” may not be evolution at all, but simply an individual organism's ability to utilize his genetic diversity and adapt himself to his local environment – that selection may not have anything to do with phenotypic change....and instead of vertically, evolution first happens horizontally. (A trait of a good scientist is to consider opposing viewpoints and alternatives, not to ignore them.)
1	Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they, termites could assure that if properly used. After 40 days and more they would be ravenous.	And what did Noah do about the termites?[
1	Actually what sank that debate was a bunch of paleontologists from K state who started arguing for punctuated equilibrium. That was pretty much the end. I remember one board member was quoted as saying "These are public schools. We are luck if we can teach the kids to read"	I would have to say that whoever told you about 'macro-evoution' from a science perspective obviously did not explain things properly. It sounds like your 'science advice' was either misunderstood or the advice was 'stacked'.
1	So you're saying that God is a "respector"?-of-persons - iow, the mom's "more"-important to *God*? than the unborn.	I do not believe it is right, but the life of the woman is more important than the unborn,
0	Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)	There are many scientists that say this is true, but there are many more that say that it isn't
0	Well, in the sense that we cannot actually detect the intelligent design Behe proposes, then it it OUTSIDE the limit of actual detection.	3. The scientific effect involved is always at the very limit of detection.
1	You assume homosexuality is a "choice", with no evidence substantiating that position, until you have been shown evidence that it is genetic???And you claim to be a "scientist by profession"???LOLOLOLOL!While you're at it, maybe you can explain to us what a "unconscious choice" is...	I'm a scientist by profession. I try to deal in facts. I've yet to see any that prove gayness is hereditary, predisposed or anything other than an unconscious/conscious choice.
0	But my point is that the Supreme Court has disagreed. Hence the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process, which maintains that the due process clause can be violated even in cases where due process has been given.	Again, the 14th Amendment just keeps any state from depriving anyone of liberty-- it doesn't DEFINE that liberty.
0	Actually, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene. The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function.	I've been telling this board for months that the gene is not the player in biological change that everyone thinks it is.

0	No one mentioned helping or not helping people here, or even dealing with the consquences of pregnancy at all. Its more;'If abortion were banned, what measures or research would you suggest to reduce the pressure for people to have illegal ones or unwanted pregnancies'.	This discussion is kind of unrelated to abortion because a link between abortion being wrong and someone not helping another in need doesn't exist. If you believe thief is wrong you don't have to become a police officer to show this.To answer your question...who knows, identifying the true problem is the start.
0	Well said. It is a disgrace that the "Flat Earth" side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the "Spontaneous Creation" side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects. Do you realise that they refuse to present the "Cheese" side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days? It's outrageous, how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue!	audi alteram partem or in English "hear both sides of an argument"....
0	does the military have a position on this or have any data to show it helps or hurts something? really that is what it should come down to.	you haven't provided any evidence the bible is a fairy tale. but i do think you like the sound of those last two words in the previous sentence. it's god or the government (romans 13) in the nt who dispense capital punishment. if you weren't so consumed with your illicit gay sex escapades to read the nt you would have known that. keep screwing around and god himself just might take you and/or your buddy jazy off the earth like he did with annanias sapphira in the book of acts.
1	Dude, you only figured that out now?   I'm disappointed in you.   just joking. Everything he states has a hidden agenda.	What was it they said about statistics?Oh yes, I remember:"Lies, damn lies and statistics".I think Jaaaman's sources are agenda pushing behind a screen of figures.
1	so let me get this straight, you would violate a womans civil rights to save a fertilized egg, but have no problem killing real people? wow.	that's why we hold the trial before the execution, not after.  wow, the system works. almost executed is not the same thing as executed. and again, while i know it does happen from time to time, how many cases can you provide as examples where someone was sentenced to death, and later exhonerated from all charges? i bet not too many.  ~'we have executed too many innocent people in this country!' *'who?' ~'well, we almost executed them.' lol, i love it. :)

1	well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy ? because making abortion illegal sure will !	i'd be more than happy to take responsibility for every baby that i sire. in fact, i have three. you want to remove the element of accountability because you don't like it. too bad! and you want it to remain legal because it will occur anyways? emoticonxconfused what kind of twisted logic is that? should we make incest legal? after all, it's going to occur anyways. emoticonxrolleyes
1	Well, you got that one exactly right. I didn't bother to watch your video. It was pretty predictable coming from you - personal attacks on creationists. I quoted YOU because of what YOU said.	Why you quoted me is questionable. What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of ****. How you consider mathematical equations "mockery" I don't know, but more likely, you did not bother to watch the video.
0	Yes, everyone is a "potential" felon. Fortunately most people never commit a felony. And there are many different types of weapons, all which could be used by previously law abiding citizens to commit an act of violence.	In a moment of extreme stress, a previously law abiding citizen might commit an act of violence with his or her firearm.
1	There you go. It's difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of when the facts are the facts!	And secondly, it's a bit rich for them to call it murder when a blastocyst can turn into a tumour.And oncologists murder tumours all the time...
1	So you're claiming the beardy bloke nailed to a couple of bits of 2X4 didn't actually exist?emoticonXRolleyes	“Either God exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question. The existence of God is a scientific question, like any other.”This is idiotic. Science investigates material phenomena, observable entities in the universe. No competent theologians or philosophers – not even the atheist ones – have ever declared that God (if he exists) is an object in his own universe. Perhaps there is no God, and intelligent Christians readily admit that there may be some legitimate doubt. But if the Judaeo-Christian God exists, then he is the maker of the universe and not an entity within it.
0	I agree, for the most part. Once you get to tanks and helicopters though? Too big, too easy a target for a tyrannical regime. Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters? I'm sure they could get them if they really wanted, but they're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers. Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines.	citizens would need to have machine guns, bazookas, shoulder launched missiles, tanks, blackhawk helicopters,
1	You're the one who needs to get a grip. Lots could get worse, but not for the reasons you're stating.   But I take it you're finally admitting that (actually) 50 million uninsured human beings who could die or go bankrupt is a big problem.	So making it much worse cures the problem. Get a grip.
0	do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security? most individuals exist from proceeds of a 'job' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other, of which they generally have no actual influence.  i find it difficult to accept that the average, individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on tv. voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit.	well, apparently the above 3 posters think iraq and the causes of said war are the most important thing to worry about. sad, but i think they missed your point.  i don't see it as what issues is america facing, but what issues are the individual american people facing. in my opinion, the issues most important to the individual person are the same as they have been for thousands of years. food, shelter, security from people and things trying to kill them, and their individual means to obtain these things. just a thought.
0	You mean that it must have has a beginning, don't you?	Since the universe must have had a finite existence, it must have been created.
1	oh yeah you're right! i suppose only sane americans get guns! no wonder 0% of the population are killed in gun warfare. oh wait, a considerable amount of people are killed by guns. silly me! of course all the sane people can also shoot who they want in some states, just because they feel threatened by it. sure keep guns, advocate them why don't you. after all, all those people killed, and the families of those people.. hasn't happened to you, so why should you care?!?! (noob...)	currently, in the u.s., when you buy a gun, you don't get it right away. it has to be registered and if you pass a sanity check, they'll approve it. it is because of this registration process that illegal guns are brought into the country and sold..., illegally. if you ban guns, this black market will flourish and the number of unregistered guns will increase. the crazies that want to shoot up a bunch of people will still be able to get a gun. i prefer regulation over making things illegal and banning them. i also prefer freedom over safety. but hey..., that's just me..., well..., me and a bunch of crazed, gun packing, red blooded americans ;)
1	The gentleman (??) in question has been presented the facts numerous times. He "pooh-pooh"s them as irrelevant. He places himself above scientific research. He doesn't know the difference between unsolicitated testimonials and scientific evidence.	It would be better to produce the facts over and again than it would by using the above tactics, Steve. There are others here that are trying their best to understand...that don't have your frame of mind nor your resources.Remember, you can tell the character of a person by what it takes to get his/her goat.
0	proof? and, i'm just surprised that brooks is actually capable of seeing where the problem lies. his solution? probably another dumb republican non-solution.	i can't tell if you're agreeing or disagreeing with david.  david comes out against intervention in the market, and says crony capitalists want more intervention in the market. obama wants to hand out money to politically connected auto industry players. are you saying david is right, and we need less government intervention in the market, or that he is wrong, and we need the government to give more money to corporations? a 'faux argument' would be a pretend argument, like pretending you are an ardent pro-lifer, and making up terrible arguments, to make the pro-life position look ridiculous. kind of like a strawman except in character.
0	How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?	...but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!!
0	You do have a problem with this person defending himself or you would not be attacking him. Fear made him do this. The fear was created in him by the buglers.   You want unarmed passengers to attack armed terrorists on airplanes, but you have a problem with a home owner killing buglers.	I am not saying what the criminals did was right, but neither was what Mr. Martin did. I have no problem with him killing them both.
1	NAAAAA, actually it makes ME sound quite sane...I'm not denying a woman the "right" to have sex all she wants. THere ARE ways of having sex WITHOUT getting pregnant, I'm sure you'd agree. SO, it actually makes YOU sound like you are desperately hanging on to the "right" to take an innocent life just because you don't want to be inconvenienced. In Bizarro world, you might be right, but not in reality	You really don't know how this makes you sound? "If you get pregnant, then I have you!"It does sound like you have issues
0	GREED but what you fail to admit is that that standard of living comes at a price for someone.	If the American system of government is so terrible, why do we have one of the highest standards of living on earth?
0	Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time.	You snipped most of my remarks because you were unable to address them. You have no answers and have been reduced to insult. That means that you have lost the discussion and you know you have lost. Otherwise you would attempt meaningful answers.
0	So, because they don't interpret the bible as you do, they believe that there are no deities? That is what you said...	simple....many Christians have been deceived....just like Adam and Eve were deceived in the Bible.
1	First off, no one says that if there is evil, there can't be a God. They say that if there's evil, then God can't be omnipotent and all benevolent. Let's keep the topics straight. Also, I see no way in which the existence of good bolsters the argument that God exists. I could posit the existence of a God of popcorn, and then say "look, here's some popcorn, my God must be real!" Somehow, I don't think that would convince you.	Originally Posted by unkerpauliethe fact is that evil and good exist, and that we can by no means use the existence of evil to conclude that God doesnt exist, because by definition the existence of evil substantiates that good exists and therefore actually supports the argument for God

1	I though the torture was just a result of the number of wing nuts there were around the place.	4Forums is secretly run by the government for the sole purpose of identifying non-conformists and physiologically torturing them with a mind control device that lets them speak directly into your brain with high frequency radio waves, this device also allows them to read your mind.

0	Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals.	Not owning a gun makes me safer and two cherry picked 911 calls does not disprove that.
0	now isn't that a terribly socialistic position to take? but, i'm confused by it at the same time, for socialists like you don't really want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now do you? emoticonxrolleyes when logic fails, there's alway ad hominem, right? and the ad hominen continues..... we're larger, more diverse, more litigious, need i go on? leaving the continued ad hominem aside, one of the causes for our high healthcare costs is litigation. since the dnc survives on the money derived from the blood-sucking trial lawyers lobby, i don't see real reform occurring until we cut those purse strings along with the big pharma's.	actually, yes i do support full medical care for our veterans with injuries sustained while serving their country. i don't know why you would think i don't. the issue is that the government has never done anything efficiently or effectively within estimated budgetary constraints. name one government agency or beaurocracy which runs within its budget.  and the estimated cost for this socialized medicine is 2 trillion dollars over what, 10 years? and the estimated actual costs are trillions more than that very conservative estimate. but you don't care about facts. you don't even want to take the time to actually read the bill. just pass it now and worry about the consequences later.  print up more money until a dollar isn't worth a mexican peso. emoticonxgood

0	i concede that it can go to a ballot. you have been arguing that such an issue should go to a ballot.  care to comment on the second point i made? to some extent this thread is about whether anyone should be concerned that all the petition signers realized what they were signing (in the context of proven wide-spread fraud on the part of the signature gatherers).	sure, and if you want to start a separate discussion about whether or not something can get struck down after the fact, be my guest. but whether or not it can go on a ballot is at stake in this discussion, and obviously it can.
0	How about the individual's offspring? Is a "subtract 10 years" gene encoded in the genome just because of one marriage?Still no evidence.	Humans have an average life expectancy of 70-75 yearsÂ…with a maximum of around 120. But what happens if a man marries his first cousin? It has been shown that life expectancy of such offspring diminishes by 10 years. This is because of the large numbe
1	you sound like such a great guy deliberately pissing off a person you call your friend. if that is what you call good works then i am truly impressed.	don't get me wrong, i am not in the least bit worried, i am an atheist through and through. this just came up in conversation with a religious friend of mine. he said 'don't you think you should believe, just in case' and i answered ' why? god isn't real and if he was he would send me to heaven before you' (the last bit was just to piss him off more than anything.

0	Not the way I see it from my experiences. I let the readers decide on their own.	As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.
0	I believe that's true, and as a "believer" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be "with" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves "not with" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be "with" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.	Ironically, when I have publicaly advanced the idea that God is generally compatable with evolution, I find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas, but many believers are dumbfounded.
0	logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law.

Why bother when you know logic, rational thinking and womens rights always take second seat to antiquated belief system dogma?

1	This is odd. You voluntarily participate in a Religion discussion forum - indeed, the frequency of your posting suggests that this participation occupies a substantial portion of your leisure time - but when someone presents you with the opportunity to demonstrate the validity of your position, you 'have better things to do'.	Sorry, I have better things to do than entertain this kind of folly.
0	Yes, they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods. You're an atheist, aren't you?	Atheism does not show 'faithful devotion' in any ultimate reality or deity. It is the LACK of a belief (the belief in gods). Your definition of religion is thin.
1	wow, your sex life is based on relativity? i assumed you were quick, but not that bad.	meh.... i guess it depends on relativity... some guys have a different girl everyday.. so compared to them i'm mediocre... some guys have a different girl yearly... so compared to them i'm a playa. i'm in the middle... different girl every month. you make your choice. p.s. no i am not single for any dates before you ask.
0	Yes, and George Dubya Bush and the GOP know it's unconstitutional.Would it really bother you so much if the feds recognized a Massachusetts or California or New York or New Jersey same-sex marriage while other states like Alabama and Utah could ban same-sex marriage?I could live with that. Most gay people already leave those states anyway.	The issue was settled at the Federal level. It's called the Defense of Marriage Act. It is Federal Law.
0	I see your point, Iangb but I'm not about to be leaving before you've had a chance to respond. I won't be "leaving" at all. You challenged me to produce an argument, so I'm going to produce my argument. I will then summarize the argument, and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with.Truthfully, this is how I should have first responded to your challenge. Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate.--Chuz	Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point. Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.
0	And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?	The bottom line is that we should be free to believe as we believe while others should be afforded that same right. Thank you.
0	Well, it might help if you could propose a mechanism for such changing traits that would stand up as well as the current model of genetic inheritance.	...to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.

0	But wouldn't it make it more likely that a gun dealer that was involved in gun trafficking would be audited and caught by the ATF? If there are less FFLs then the ATF has more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer.	Thats an easy one. The obvious and correct answer is a resounding no. It has had no effect on the criminal use of guns and no thinking person would have predicted that it would. It would be like reducing the number of scalple salesman in an effort to reduce botched surgeries.
1	I also took a look and think your evaluation is charitable.	I have already seen your site. I got the link from two other boards.It's pretty dumb.
0	That's certainly an interesting point. I know next to nothing about global economics, so I won't try to argue here. But I will make a guess that such a thing will never happen as long as we're still a superpower and cling to our beloved dollar. Probably we'll devolve into just four or five major currencies in the next 50 or so years and leave it at that for a long while.But to stay on topic, I'm just wondering why such a thing was brought up as a Sign of The End. Why would it seem evil to someone living back then? It's an oft-quoted religious statistic that always leaves me scratching my head.	Well, it may be evil even though it doesn`t signal the end times. I mean, if we where all to have the same currency there would be some really daunting economic implications when we experience local or regional demand or suply shocks for example.
1	Well, it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution. One doesn't expect Creationists to possess it.	I have believed that God created everything 'in the beginning' for as long as I can remember. There was a time in my life where I believed that God created evolution, but after seeing the video, I changed to total creationist.
1	i don't see why not. if somebody is perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they'd hesitate if it meant crushing a skull with a bat rather than just shooting them in the face. seriously, what kind of stability are you dealing with when all it takes to motivate someone to murder is a simple question? a baseball bat isn't concealable like a handgun, is it? nor can it be readily used by someone suffering arthritis or used in a cramped location. any weapon can be used to inflict death and murder. the human body is hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near-indestructibility. even sneezing wrong can be potentially fatal. certainly not. do you see a contradiction?	do you think mr. bledsoe would have wound up dead if the perps had been carrying baseball bats  and he had said, youre not going to hit me with that thing? nothing less than a gun will work when you guys want to defend yourselves,  but all weapons are equally deadly in the hands of another.  you don't see a contradiction there?
0	quite frankly,i am astounded by you homosexuals (or homosexual supporters) who claim to hate judging yet judge religious people.....those who judge and those who don't... if i were to say a controversial statement such as 'whats the point of entering an exit?' you would have been hurt or angered..yet you would make disrespectful,hatred-provoking comments that was quite the opposite of the message you were spewing just arguments prior to your comment.	religion makes people dumb. more accurately it preys upon their dumbness.
0	I may be a pro-gunner but what doe's that have to do with with gay rights?   Since I'm a pro- gunner I won't force my life style or views on you,if you don't force yours on me.Deal?   After all you seem to be the expert on gay rights.	prominent conservative j. harvie wilkinson of the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals compared heller to roe v. wade and criticized it for its lack of adherence to conservative methodology: 'heller represents a triumph for conservative lawyers. but it also represents a failure - the court's failure to adhere to a conservative judicial methodology in reaching its decision. in fact, heller encourages americans to do what conservative jurists warned for years they should not do: bypass the ballot and seek to press their political agenda in the courts.' ssrn-of guns, abortions, and the unraveling rule of law by j. wilkinson  supreme court justice stevens also made a similar criticism. 'with emphasis on the word 'genuine,' stevens said that 'a genuine judicial conservative' would not have inserted the court into the 'political thicket' of the gun rights debate as scalia had done.'  the blt: the blog of legal times : supreme court: scalia and stevens duke it out so are pro-gun activists not so different than gay rights activists? both groups have used the courts to further their own agenda. it probably would have been better if scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court, 'there certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the second amendment and i, as an amateur historian, am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others. i will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities.'

0	i'm kind of amused by the idea that the king james version is the most accurate, there are a lot of fairly well documented flaws, like the introduction of unicorns into the old testament. you also seem to imply that modern translations were dreamed up by a couple of drunken biblical scholars with nothing better to do on a friday evening, whereas most are at least as rigorously researched as the kjv, and often with a greater number of sources available.	i was just wanting to make sure it was in the new testiment. my reason for this is you said... if the verse were from the old testiment, it wouldn't matter that jesus can come in and perfect one's heart because they didn't know who jesus was. that's really all. but it doesn't really matter since that's not really the main point of your post.
1	I guess he was a "democrat" as well. He certainly would not have been a republican.	Jesus had a lot of uncomfortable things to say to the rich and powerful.
1	It also isn't a baby yet either. It is called a fetus.	According to what? Are you saying you should be able to kill a baby 2 inches from being born if you wanted? It isn't born yet.
1	Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile.	Humans attempt to create new species, such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers, but these "NEW" species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves.
0	In my reading of the Declaration (and using the 1st. Amendment as a filter) it doesn't matter who or what the founders meant by "Creator." The conlusion is the same; regardless. Namely; The fact that the founders considered our basic rights to be inherrent.	As I'm sure you know, the Declaration of Independence states: "...all men are created equal, they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."Who or what do you consider to be the (capitalised) Creator in this text? More importantly, who do you think the authors of the Declaration considered the Creator to be?The Declaration certainly seems to tie up the notion of 'inalienable rights' with religion.No more, I'm going to bed.
0	But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural.	A fairer comparison for science as a whole would be the inner way of thinking and knowing, as contrasted to that based on external empiricism. I think that has far more staying power.
0	the top 10% of people in this country pay 67% of the taxes. most of the money from the middle class? no, not at all.	the big problem is that most of that tax money neither goes towards the needs or the wants of the american people, and all the tax money is coming from the middle class. while the less than 5% wealthy doesn't pay any taxes after their tax returns. if we solved this problem then we would have more than enough money to pay for a free health care.

0	You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.I have to say that is false. We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. In addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up. So sorry, but you struck out.	So, you think there is a God? Bad design does not equate to no design. It really is a poor argument.Much of the force of Darwin's arguments deal with bad design. I invite anyone to post any of Darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of "bad" design. That said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. One could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.Your audio CD's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. Cleary this is "bad design" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. Same with modems and host of other devices. Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. Clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible. The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem.The Mp3's and JPEGS are even more "error" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.A similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency. The point is "bad" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all. The high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.Origin of Species Chapter 13:There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike. How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas.Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function. He says homology is evidence of an unwise design. The premise is a Creator wouldn't be so inefficient.But, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of "bad design" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio CD's or fuel inefficient cars). The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. Like a great novel, the "imperfections" of biology are part of a larger plot.It is turning out, Darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis.
0	i simply quoted to you your own scripture, ez. how is that construed as bashing? de 21:20-21 and they shall say unto the elders of his city, this our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die:  mr 16:17-18 and these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.	now orion, there you go trying to bash someone else's religion when you still have not been able to document who your god is, where it lives, and be able to substantiate your beliefs with anything other than a feel-good whim. you have created your own god - a liberal's god who approves of gay sex, shacking up, fornication, worshiping satan and baal (i.e. your 'all paths lead to heaven here, frank), etc., etc.  you've got no credibility around here until you come out of the closet with your 'god'. then you can run with the big dogs.
1	let's see if i understand you correctly, because i think you may be on to something incredibly insightful. let's see, the island with males and females, uh, can reproduce, and, ... uh,  eureka, i've got it!!! you need a male and female to sexually reproduce!!!! that's ingenious!!!! you're brilliant, cool spot!! you're forgetting one thing. the island without the gay guys would not be nearly as fabulous.	i don't think so. i think everyone else is overcomplicating it. yeah, gays can't reproduce. survival to the fittest would indicate that gays should die off, but they are being helped along. if they weren't helped along and were told to rely solely on themselves then they would have no chance of survival. well if that's the way humans work then the gay island wouldn't do any better, unless of course you are saying gays aren't human. but i'm guessing what you mean is if the gays died off and the straight island had it's resources destroyed then the island itself would be worse off, but i was talking more about the people's civilization, not the island itself. sorry about lesbian island. it got hit by 2 earthquakes and a tsunami and sunk into the ocean.
0	Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. The reason I say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. Kinda just says that there are other people out there.	I don't know what I think about this. Personally, I believed that Cain and Seth did marry their sisters. I know, sounds like incest, and today that is what it would be.However, you need to remember that there were no exact set of laws at the beginning of the creation. Almost all of God's followers were spoken to by him and were given visions and angels to tell them what to do. I don't believe it was considered incest till the law was written abolishing that sort of thing.I'm not sure about him creating other women either, but you could be right. After all, I've found the idea of him creating life on other planets AFTER the creation acceptable (still wondering about the end of the creation where he stopped though) so with that view in mind, I suppose it's possible.
0	Well, I didn't really mean to go that far. But I'm talking about problems like that all worked out, thought about previously, and that the problem was worked out. I'm talking more about, what if you could make laborers stronger, scientists smarter, and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome, narcolepsy, etc.). I don't think of making everyone the same for that reason. I'm just saying, what if there was a way to better society without going overboard? If the problems were worked out, which I'm sure they will be, what would your moral view on it be?	There are a few fictional works which addressed this possibility and brought up interesting points. One is Aldous Huxley's book Brave New World. In it, people were grown in artificial wombs, not born, and they could be genetically designed. In the book, a high level official of this society mentions to the main character that an experiment had been tried in which all the people made were brilliant, athletic and beautiful - anyway, characteristics that we admire in people (nothing was said about picking their moral character). They ended up killing each other in competition for the better jobs and for leadership since nobody was willing to play the subservient menial role. Therefore, this society purposely grew humans who were at different levels (some very mentally deficient) to supply a distributions of people who could fit the distribution of roles necessary for society.Therefore, on an individual level, I don't have much of a problem with genetic engineering (assuming that we really fully knew what we are doing, which is doubtful since many unforseen side effects could occur). However, on a societal level, it could be very problematic.

There are ways to resolve that issue. emoticonXRolleyes	As a matter of fact, I find those to be a HUGE turn off. If I wanted a penis, I'd be with a man. I don't want a penis, I want what I have.

0	I did not say that evolution precludes God, all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God. If a person does not beleive in God, then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality.	There is nothing about the theory of evolution that precludes a God. That fabricated idea is absurd. There is nothing about the theory of relativity, nor the theory of gravity, nor the theory that the earth is round that precludes the existence of a Creator God. In reality, God may or may not exist. Some people believe God exists. Others do not believe God exists. Neither view can be proven based on physical evidence. Both are beliefs only. Though one of those beliefs must necessarily be true.
0	no base for calling it a human being? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being. Seems you have no basis for saying I can't call a fetus a human being.	That logic can be applied to weeds or trees. Anything that is non-sentient, or non-mental existant. Should we make gardening illegal too? The thing is, you have no base for calling it a human being or giving it the same rights as us.

My Lord simone, a simple C-Section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby. But you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution.

0	So, the Supreme Court rested its decision not on the 9th Amendment as the District Court had done, but chose instead to base it on the 14th Amendment.	This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.
0	I posted two versions:1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated due to "miraculous" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source.	You'll have to specify which argument. My response was to your question "Can religious views be logical?"
0	Please note that I added the word "human" to your comment above IANGB. After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / "persons." Agree? Also, I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights (life) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have.	An alternative (shorter!) wording of the statement, taking into account the greater context of the Constitution, would be "A (human) zygote is a person". As hinted by the title, the general context of this thread is how the statement relates to the rights of a zygote; we may end up branching out into that area, but the statement is the starting point.
1	Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata.	I know what I'm talking about.
1	well, then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells? what's their reason then? we don't know, because the doctors might not want everything that they're doing be on the front page of every newspaper. they have their reasons for their actions, and they just don't want people like you to know about them. or...they already have their reasons published and everything and you're just 2 close-minded 2 take the information in.	If it was anybody I was choose adult stem cells. My whole point is that adult stem cells work and embryonic cells don't.
0	Yes that is a problem. But there is an instance when the 2nd Amendment did protect the USA from invaders:"Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland US forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast" - http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob70.htmlIf it wasn't for the 2nd Amendment you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the West coast, German if you live on the East coast.	This is so inane I dont know where to start.Firstly - If there existed an armed forces capable of destroying the US military, then an armed civilian population would be absolutely no barrier to them.Secondly - There is no single nation on earth that can move 200,000,000 men.Thirdly - How exactly do you propose China get its men to the USA? Are they going to use their secrect commie teleporting machines? There is no chance for them to cross the oceans, or deploy either north or south of the USA.

0	How right you are to,and given the forum here, make it a crime to own to own a gun,well I think most of us are automatically criminals.It's like the signs you see...SHOPLIFTERS WILL BE PROSECUTED!lot a good they do.emoticonXBanghead,yeah know matter how illegal their will be crime.	In my veiw, no law can make any country crime free. The only way to make a country crime free is to get rid of laws, which would just be ridiculous. If somebody wants to do something bad enough, no law can stop them from doing it. As long as there are laws, there will be crime.
1	I have no problem with them preaching against gays in their churches and the privacy of thier homes. Its when they crawl out from under their rocks that I have a problem. I also have absolutly no problem what so ever with them talking about Jesus if only they would keep to the subject of Jesus and leave all gay issues alone. Unfortually Paul has replaced Jesus in many churches.	I didn't misunderstand you at all. Like I said, you are for persecuting religious people if they don't agree 100% with you.
0	the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the "greatest possible being". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. "greatest" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that existits like "the oldest man alive". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence	I think there is something wrong with Premse One. It translates into English as "If God exists, then he exists in all possible worlds." No logical rule justifies this statement. It is equally foolish to say that "If England exists, then it exists in all possible worlds." But clearly, England does not exist in the possible world where Earth never formed.
1	He stated that " statistics show that firearms cause aggression in individuals", no mention of the word can anywhere in there that I saw.	You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean "will", "must", or "shall" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it "CAN" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun.

0	which one is this brady? the discredited kellerman study by the discredited kellerman? or the opinion piece of the rabidly anti-gun brady campaign? cite your sources. and answer the damn question already. is self-defense with a firearm an immoral act? it's not rocket science, there's only two answers; yes or no.	the risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns.[3] the risk of suicide is five times greater in households with guns.[4] what's more, tragic stories of accidental or unintentional shootings from the careless storage of guns at home are all too common. the statistic noted above bears repeating: a gun in the home is 22 times more likely to be used in a criminal, unintentional, or suicide-related shooting than to be used in a self-defense shooting. [5] putting your family in all that danger because youre nuts about guns is immoral
0	So, this statement is from a 'law center' that is dedicated to defend the religious freedom for CHristians. Yet, this isn't about 'religion'. Why do I find that hypocritical.	"This case is about free inquiry in education, not about a religious agenda," said Patrick Gillen of the Thomas More Law Center in his opening statement. The center, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, lobbies for what it sees as the religious freedom of Christians and is defending the school district.
0	Thats an odd analogy. Can a child survive without its mother? I'd say a baby is no less dependent on its mother the first few years than it is when in it grew in the womb.  Is the child still a parasite then?	Also, a fetus isn't a child. A child can live without it's mother. A fetus cannot. We don't see a fetus as a parasite, but that essentially what it is.....

0	Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings.	Why hasn't natural selection weeded out species with their inferior "optical vision" and given them all echolocation, which would allow them superior senses in day and night, rather than just daytime?

0	Today's students are tomorrow's scientists. They are unlikely to study something that, if they hear about it at all, they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origins of atheist evolution. To reduce ID to other classes like literature or social sciences, etc. (where poetry, fiction, and prehistoric beliefs are the subject matter) is nothing more than a clever, dishonest attempt to belittle it.	It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.
1	So a gun is a fire hazard in a public place? I gotta say the gun haters are getting more creative with their arguments.	The statement was made based upon historical evidence. Practices such as loyalty oaths and fire safety ordinances were common place in colonial times and could be regarded as restrictions on the bearing of arms for effective self defense. The supreme court never determined that these were unacceptable restrictions or infringements.

0	The difference, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done, has been given much thought and study. The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men, until, the fait accompli has been established. If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment.	I can understand the argument that gun laws may infringe on some individual freedom, but I don`t really understand what the constitution has to do with it. Sure, its much harder to make a change in the constitution, but this doesn`t really affect wether the change should  be done or not.
0	Hmm, when you say "numberless" do you mean something other than the standard definition of infinite? If not, please explain how an infinite number of organisms could be created in a finite time with finite space and resources. Thank you.	Not one that a solid case can be made for. If it happened they would be numberless just as Darwin said...
0	Things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years. Or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process. Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range, any time during those billions of years.	You talked about a 'natural bias' that would stop evolution in its tracks. You're going to have to be more specific about what 'stopping evolution in its tracks' means. Do you mean preventing inheritable variation? Preventing natural selection? Preventing gene flow? What?
0	And the loss to society because people used guns instead of an alternate weapon is?	But just try and remove them from those that think we do and you will have a war on your hands. It's too bad we didn't become more like Canada is respect to gun ownership. A lot more people would be alive today and others not sitting in prison for crimes they commited.
0	The only person who can take away your sin is God. No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins, so get over it.	And to think that the God in question needs someone to acknowledge their presence as their lord and master before this all covering evil falls away,
0	The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan. It does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought. This is where your mistake lies.	There IS an intrinsic, inherent item of biological evolution that ISN'T scientifically valid and that could well be responsible over time for the eugenic-mess we've seen over the years.Evolutionary theory itself preaches and teaches No-Teleology-No-Conscious-Forethought.
1	You can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. That not how it should works.	Putting a minority's rights to a majority vote, has a very slim chance of the minority ever winning, if the minority has any chance at all. How was same-sex marriage rammed down anyone's throat, JP? No one would be forced to have one.

Let us not stop there let us sanction union between human and animals. After all I love my Dog and my Parrot. Why stop with GAYs?   By the way where does the term GAY come from for homosexuals.	Every couple who wishes to be married should apply for a marriage liscence tomorrow, valentines day. If the town halls are inundated with requests then it will send a message that we GLBT people as a whole will not tolerate being made into 2nd class citizens
0	How the heck does darwinism get one out of poverty????I think you are generalizing by lumping ALL education into the specific areas that some religious conservatives oppose. If they opposed getting degrees, going to grad school, etc., I could see your point. But I don't know of any religious sect that opposes that.	It is a pattern. What I see as an important mechanism to get out of poverty is education. The conseravtive religious people in the more poverty stricken areas are taught that education is 'evil' because it deny's the bible. How often have you seen some red necked hick talk about "Athesitic darwinism"
0	Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that "informed" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution.	Today, no informed creationist would deny natural selection.
0	I believe the question was "who?"I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now.	I would say no.......I mean if you can believe in God, the you must believe that He's going to put what he means in the Bible. "He formed us from the dust of the earth...." Why wouldn't He put something else, like we evolved....don't argue that they wouldn't be able to comprehend that kind of science back then because you are limiting the ability of God.......
1	you kidding? ez can't see past the front of his cobwebbed skull.	hey speaking of clueless, what would you call the rather significant increase in the percentage of wealth for the top 5% over the last couple decades? how about redistribution of wealth.  how about trickle down economics? you realize in order for that to have a chance to work you have to keep the incentives for the rich to invest that money domestically. otherwise they get the breaks and then ship that extra wealth offshore where it stays because there is no incentive to bring it back. thems good numbers making folk using them things they teach in them fancy city colleges.  if you could see past last week and next week you might understand the slow erosion of the things that are in place to make some of these ideas work.
0	If you paid attention the BATFE said so.       Yes but some people don't want to close the borders. They prefer no border controls.	And we know this how?

Burglars and muggers have enough sense to know that while getting done for burglary or mugging will not be pleasant, getting done for burglarly or mugging AND possession of a firearm will be far, far worse, assuming they survive the arrival of the armed response squad.

0	reckon you don't know much about christianity then.  when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about. until then your claim that christianity is untrue is simply a lot of hot air.	i'm only rabidly against something so obviously untrue as that of mainstream religion. my argument is that the only reason it is mainstream is that we continually perpetuate it by indoctrinating our kids with it. do you honestly believe you would have found whatever religion you prescribe to if you had not been persuaded to from an early age? why didn't you pick islam? the only difference in christianity and islam in my mind is that islam happens to be the religion of poor states that have been oppressed by empire states. if christianity was the religion in the middle east and northern africa and the west was islamic, you would probably see suicide bombing christians. i expect i will likely get another roflmao out of you for saying this, but it is probably true.  the only difference between islam and christianity is demographic.

0	Actually, what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else. Denying the right to marriage because of his/her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens. The supporters of the anti-gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public, the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it. Ever read John Locke or JS Mill? You should, it's what our country ideals are based on. You have your bubble and I have mine so just leave me alone; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs.	As do you. You seriously want to dictate to others that your opinions are the truth. I'm sure you find a lot of things amusing, given your warped view on things. Actually I think that what a lot of the 55-60% of the country who oppose gay marriage find, is that if they join an internet site, that they will be viciously attacked by gay marriage supporters. That's what most of you are REALLY LIKE.  There really isn't much of an anti-gay movement, except a handful of people and a few commercials. Your vilification of them is typical of most far left gay marriage supporters.
0	do you mean when pelosi said the protestors had nazi banners, when they were actually banners saying 'no' to nazism? she's in the democrats. you mean the fantasy land whitehouse version of the proposals, that no one has actually read? no one that understands the constitution would say that, that's a very ignorant comment. what's perverted is that you think freedom of speech means the people have to shut up while they listen patiently to the government propaganda machine.	when the party of opposition promotes lies and fearmongering, then denies those who attend townhall meetings an audience with their elected representatives, and the opportunity to hear the actuality of the proposals, then that impinges on freedom of speech. the frenzied screaming shouting claques prevent any meaningful discussion taking place, to ensure that only their perverted message is heard.

In a case where it's blatantly obvious, as in this one, then obviously there's an issue of homophobia here.	Then I guess you haven't been paying much attention in our last few conversations. When it comes to your views on homosexuality and homophobia, there is no "of course". If you want people to think that you find a stance homophobic, then you need to actually come out and say so.
1	I wonder if I can convince a judge that all other legal documents should be read in an "enlightened" way.

0	That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory.	No, because 2+2= 4 if you agree with it or not.It's a concept that is not dependent on man to agree with it.

But if he keeps fighting and hurt other people he gets killed. Even in the Bible you dont get punished so severly on accidents.	"If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life." - Ex 20:22-23this suggests that when an abortion occurs, the one responsible will be punished, but not by death unless the woman is killed. even the bibles says that the mother's life is more important than the fetus.
0	But still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.What debate are you trying to end here? The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?	The purpose of hte bill of rights is to recognise certain pre-exisitng rights, but specifically NOT to curtail any that are not specifically recognised.
1	BOY-HOWDY!!!!! You have spoken the truth and spoken it well. Welcome to you from the conservative South.	I personally believe that abortion is murder of a defenseless, innocent, unborn infant in the womb and should not be legal unless the mother's life was endangered or possibly in the case of rape and incest........I believe it is the most barbaric act one human being can perpetrate on another........
1	so you agree simple foreknowledge is not determinism in the way i explained it? if so, can you explain that to electrolyte, who is having a terrible time coming to grips with that? he has omnipotent foreknowledge about future events, is the way i would put it.	ez, you are still arguing against foreknowledge causing an event, something i, time and time again, have explicitly stated is not the point i am making. please, show a little respect for yourself and others and stop throwing up this strawman. four uses of the past tense to describe events happening in the future. hmm. i'm going to try and take this step by step. 1: according to you, can god step 'outside time' and see the whole of history, past, present and future, as a static, four-dimensional sculpture?
1	That could also be very effective in a positive manner during political campaign speeches.	Only after I put a thirty round burst of .223's at their feet , :)
0	But it is OK to teach your religion in public school classrooms? Is that what you mean? What about my religion. Is it OK for me to teach it to your children against your will?	Normal folks, people who are not just trying to **** on somebody elses religon or force their religon down somebody elses throat seem to be pushing for a secular and neutral classroom. This is not an unobtainable goal.
1	Why do "they" want it to be true? Some "gay" science agenda?	I think by now you surely must be realizing that you are wasting your breath--to them it HAS to automatically be true because some scientists think so. (As if scientists are never wrong.) But let's face it, they WANT it to be true so much, they aren't willing, under any circumstances to consider that it just might not.
1	Why should you mutilate your son? Maybe you should have listened	The procedure is neither in the public interest nor that of the patient's. It's legal coercion inspired by religion. When my son was born I was "required" to listen to a 15 minute lecture on why circumcision was now a bad thing before I could have my son cut. I found it offensive since the lecture had nothing to do with medicine.
1	Oh my goodness, yes. I had forgotten that scenario. How silly of me.	Playing devils advocate.But statistically you may kill me in the future with your gun. You have to give up your rights now.Your violating my rights. (Although I know you are and I can't name the right nor find the right in the Constitution)
0	Quite frankly, you don't know squat about me. So stop trying to pretend you do.I have gone on record to say I think Christianity does a lot of good in the world.I have even tried to correct Matthew in his anti-Christian tirades.

0	"Usually, "rationality" is a Humpty-Dumpty word, that means whatever the user finds is convenient to club his opponents with."http://world.std.com/~mhuben/skept/rationality.htmlKnowledge itself is a limited commodity. To make a claim that everything is knowable is a statement that is impossible to prove; Scientism makes this claim. Closely related to it is Objectivism."Scientism, in the strong sense, is the self-annihilating view that only scientific claims are meaningful, which is not a scientific claim and hence, if true, not meaningful."http://skepdic.com/scientism.htmlRecommended Reading:"Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time" by Michael ShermerNot only does it include creationism, :) but also the philosophy of Ayn Rand (Objectivism)	Creation: The belief that the universe (and of course everything in it) was created by some supernatural entity.To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something "outside" the knowable universe. Because this is irrational, the entire concept of creation is irrational to "believe" in. You can believe in it, but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief.

In an effort to answer where the water went, they encounter the problem of explaining where the heat went.	The flood opened waters of the deap splitting the contenints and begining the drift.
0	Again, you are the affirmative, you must support your claims. Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition. I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition, which is a neutral one.	That's true, but how much have we actually learned, and how much have we theorized, with an atheist presupposition, the only presupposition currently allowed?
1	What exactly are the age ranges of these "children" in the news stories?	I live in a place where local evening news includes a story about children being shot or killed at least weekly.
0	my goodness. i spoke to fast. :) i'll give you that one. i am shocked you even took the time to reply to my petty argument.	no, it's because there is no evidence of their existence. for instance, we can not see air, but we have evidence of its existence. the most valid argument is that there are planets that can support life. i say it's valid because this is true (unlike other alien arguments). but this is not a good argument for alien existence because the conditions themselves do not prove life. they just prove conditions.
0	pro-choice is only pro child if the choice is not abortion and they are only pro family when the choice for family. So really pro choice can be pro child or anti child and pro family or anti family.	Pro choice is pro child is pro family.Having access to contraception and to abortion if contraception fails or for other reasons strengthens the family.

0	Kent Hovind is a slimy, uneducated, hack. His only education past high school is a degree from an unaccredited bible school. He is also a liar, since I just can't believe that anyone could be so stupid to say some of the things that he does. Of course, there are other people that are so stupid that they actually believe him.	The Big Bang was proved wrong years ago by Kent Hovind.
1	you're joking, right?!?!?! you really believe books, teachers, computers, etc. are more important than a hungry child whose parents cannot afford to pay? wow...	students should pay for their lunches, or bring their own lunch to school.  money used by the school district to pay for free lunches for students is money that could have been spent on more important things like books, teachers, computers, etc.
1	Please tell me, why did you believe your pastor, but not me? What did he say that was so convincing? And please, PLEASE, tell me what you think the Bible might not be saying that could have any bearing on this in the slightest. How can the fact that we don't know Ehosh's second cousin twice removed have any bearing on this at all, or whatever you think the Bible wasn't saying?	He believes also that the genealogy between Adam and Noah allows for an accurate accounting of the years between the two events. His main point to me was that although we know that the bible doesn't give a complete genealogical record, where it does, it is reliable. And that is what I have been saying all along too. I'm not questioning what the bible DOES SAY. I'm questioning WHAT IT DOESN'T SAY. But for the time being, until I can support what bothers me about dating the Creation of the World using genealogies, then I must concede that this record from Adam to the flood is as accurate a record as is possibly available at this time according to the bible.
0	They are not exactly the same. See the examples above. It is not random.	In contrast, evolutionists laughingly look at the miniscule differences between individuals of a population and dare call those who survive the "fittest" -- when actually, since each member of the population is almost exactly the same, the "fittest" are actually just the luckiest
0	'if it's beside the point' the why bring it up, jyoshu. why 'talk out of both sides of your mouth'?  and your right wing talking points are stale and tired. comparing different civil rights movements is not 'piggybacking'. and incidentally, why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people. there are female gay people that suffered along with the women. on top of such discrimination, gay people may have had no family support. some were probably lobotomized against their wishes. some were raped, some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about. no, my friend. it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not.	that is beside the point--it is still the civil rights of black people that gay lobbyists often try to piggyback off of.  it's disingenuous to suggest that gay people have suffered anywhere near the same level of oppression.
1	go back to the part in which we were discussing a specific case and stop trying to encompass the universe in your justification. (you know there are mothers in bokoboko that don't have enough lizard eggs to feed their babies so they eat them)emoticonxbanghead  i'm not surprised that a moral definition of selfish disgusts you. splat! :)	why is it moot? do pregnant women who are choosing adoption suddenly don't have themselves and dependents to care for. if i were pregnant and said pregnancy would prevent me from providing for myself or my son i would end it. the question was why some women choose abortion over adoption. one reason is because the pregnancy is a threat to being able to provide for oneself. and your definition of selfish disgusts me. whooooosh.
1	Yeah, but it's the NYTimes. And it's an editorial. Two things that, together, make a pungent recipe for a nice dish of bias.	The NY Times has a fairly good bio for Judge Roberts.http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/21/po...rtner=homepageOne quote in particular struck me:In his confirmation testimony two years ago, he said that judges should be "ever mindful that they are insulated from democratic pressures precisely because the framers expected them to be discerning law, not shaping policy," and added: "That means that judges should not look to their own personal views or preferences in deciding the cases before them. Their commission is no license to impose their preferences from the bench."If he holds to that belief than we could do alot worse. Unfortunately his tenure on the bench has been so short that it's hard to say if he meant that, or was just saying what he thought people wanted to hear.
0	You don't beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means?	I disagree with your decision. It would have been better if you sucked it up and kept the kid. Even if you ended up on the street at least you wouldn't have killed anyone. I dont mean to be judgemental, and I'm not calling you a bad person, but what you did was wrong.
0	Mayabe this is a miniscule amount of suffering compared to what awaits you on the flipside. Weather it be an eternity of Bliss or agony and suffering. Who really knows. Mayabe those who have this happen to them have it coming to them?	Umm...thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do.This is just pure intentional ignorance - you do realise Peddlar, that things can happen over time? Not to mention that evolutionary hypothesis have been made and then tested - protein homology for one, there is no way anyone knew the answer before hand but what was observed later when technology improved is what was expected. DNA dating pretty much gives the same time for common ancestors as fossils do.There is really no difference between carrying out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observing it than millions of years - other than the latter makes it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime.Science is the current sum of human knowledge about how the world works.Never get published thoughThere is a massive amount of evidence that points to things being designed via evolution rather than a concious designer - there are massive amount of badly designed organs and organisms, either God is spiteful or incompetant. Lets not go into the parasitic wasps and hyperparasitic wasps which are what made Darwin convert (or part of it). He couldn't beleive that a kind benevolent creator would design such horrors intentionally. Having something's larvae consume your organs whilst still alive and feeding of another catapilar's guts whilst still inside them strikes you as a kind and good thing to do?
1	LoL What part of a Binding Document, the Constitution with it's Bill of Rights, don't you understand!

1	Somebody needs to check his Little Golden Dictionary. "Random" and "selective" are antonyms. To say that selection is random is to admit ignorance of the English language.	I have no idea what mechanism/explanation you favour wrt biological evolution, but if it is the Random, spontaneously generated, coincidental to organismic need, plus local, accidental, cull by chance environmental factor "Natural Selection" notion, then here's a surprise alert for you--you believe in a notion that is intrinsically and essentially chance-based, that is, a notio9n that not only involves random accidents, but one that involves nothing but random, local, and anomalous accidents. There are no universal forces , such as gravity, electro-magnetism, weak and strong molecular forces, attached to your, "Natural Selection". Time for you to wake up and smell the coffee. RMNS is nothing better than a childish superstition.
1	Good lesson! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions. Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you...you should just casually drive away. Thanks Simone!	You know, I think that you are rather an evil person, trying to create guilt where no guilt exists, where no guilt is necessary. Someone made a very important decision at a critical point in her life which made her life better and averted the consequences of a stupid mistake made by a youth. It was not an easy decision for her to make but she made it and it's well in the past, except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it.

0	If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS (or some other legally recognized union) as married couples, why does it matter which "door" they come in through? They get all the same benefits, including the benefits that come when one partner dies.What's the beef...except that you can't say that you're "married"?	1) It's hardly "solved".Same-sex marriage is not legal in France. As of 2006, one same-sex marriage ceremony has been conducted in France and was declared void. France has a statute authorizing civil unions, known as PACS, between same-sex and unmarried opposite-sex couples.Same-sex marriage was an issue in the 2007 presidential election, with the Conservative UMP opposing it and the Socialist Party supporting it, though both candidates support civil unions (PACS).....On June 5, 2004, former Green Party presidential candidate Noël Mamère, Mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of Bègles, conducted a same-sex marriage ceremony for two men, Bertrand Charpentier and Stéphane Chapin. Mamère claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony, and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights.French Justice Minister Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void, and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.Same-sex marriage in France - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWhat France has is "well, both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side-door, but only the whites can enter by the main door"We wouldn't find such an "acommodation" satisfactory for blacks.And furthermore, I think you would find that it's the ANTI-GAYS who have the problem with this.If Obama is able to try to put up "civil unions" on the federal level, you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him.Not the gays...
0	From my first post, starting with the quote from the religioustolerance website;	You are going to have to explain what happenstance origins are, becase as said earlier, I couldn't find any definition from any of the dictionaries I searched, and all I get from google is a theology forum and a 101 contradictions to the bible. Neither is a very credible source.
0	I know a bit about this myself.  However the difference is that I was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute. An Armed person truly cannot be bullied! The old saying is. God created man and Samuel Colt made them equal! Old, disabled, female and all, are on an equal footing with these vicious predators!	A mother who killed herself and her disabled daughter had been terrorised by a gang of youths and had her repeated pleas for help ignored by police, an inquest was told yesterday. …The single mother, her daughter and teenage son, Anthony, had endured ten years of being virtual prisoners in their own home as a gang of up to 16 “street kids” tormented them for simply “existing”Despite Mrs Pilkington and her family repeatedly calling the police and reporting that they had received death threats, she was told to close her curtains and ignore the children, a jury was told. A Leicestershire Police log shows that she called them more than twenty times in seven years to say that her severely dyslexic son's life had been threatened, her daughter, who had acute special needs, was being bullied and her house was under attack from the gang of youths.
0	Because the modern application of gun control is to target everyone. But that doesn't change the fact that gun control began as a purely racist concept.	You talk about the Fourteenth Amendment and again claim that gun control is racist. If gun control is truly racist then it's a wonder that the courts in areas with strict gun control laws haven't been flooded with claims of violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. Funny how only a few people on an online message board have managed to figure this out.
0	I do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define ALL abortions as either right or wrong. In between, there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong. Why limit yourself to the extreme views? I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. After all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with. However, the question of people's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights. Really ... what other question is more relevant?	Well it all depends on who is going to determine "right", isn't it? Abortion is not math. There are no finite answers. Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history. I do like Aristotle's take; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable.
1	yes..but what is the difference between killing for fun and killing by mistake???? you drive your big suv to work every day...how many animals do you accidently kill? how many insects? oh wait, you judge a life by how big the life is...ignorant humans!	i think yes! very important to show that any violence will be punished. it will create full sense of the force of law. on the other hand people will understand that they must take care about animals. and it may be impetus that will make less stray animals.
1	Whose culture are we talking about, here?  I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?	it's a part of doing that with marriage though. it's a way of changing marriage.  it basically is abolishing it in a cultural sense, from what it's been defined as. that 'one iota' we're discussing is a major change: part of the very heart of what marriage is.
1	i'm not 'claiming victory' after going off track to an unrelated topic. what i am addressing is related because i am saying it is irrelevant. how is that not related? in fact, this is another example of you changing the subject matter. to point out that they are irrelevant. i thought that was clear.	pot ... kettle ... black emoticonxrolleyes once again i provide a friendly reminder of the op's original 'subject matter' and thus the essence of debate in this particular thread. i've even taken a moment to highlight the questions the op wishes to address. if you dont want to address the arguments then that is of course your perogative. why would you waste your time discussing consequences of certain actions if you find them irrelevant anyway? even if it does contradict your ability to do so in other threads. :)
0	i think that's an excellent question. since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, i can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings.  there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research. since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, i'm not surprised with the claims made. here's a relevent story.	what do you think is motivating these scientists to lie to us?
1	ummmmmmm, because it was built in 1932-1935, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the founders or early government leaders, nor with what they believed was correct? you really are the master of the art of self-pwn, archie.	if the founders and early government leaders believed that the modern liberal interpretation of separation of church and state is correct then why is the image of moses carrying the ten commandments carved into the supreme court building? ten commandments stunner: feds lying at supreme court
1	another question that shouild be answered is . . . if the bible says that noah and a few members of his family were the only ones to survive this 'global' flood, how come there are so many other accounts of others surviving a flood? did god miss the target (that being the whole of humanity)? genesis 6:13 (new international version) 13 so god said to noah, 'i am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. presumably he also knew from the beginning of time that he was going to make this great big ####-up. how embarrassing!	the common element shared by flood myths is a surfeit of water. in order to be considered as evidence of a global event, all of them must have happened at the same time. did they?
0	okay, at least you gave an example for reagan. i personally think the russians were on the decline long before the end of the cold war, and reagan happened to be president when they finally fell, but we can agree to disagree. for bush i hope you're joking, because it has been quite clear that his policies have more than likely created more terrorists than he has helped defeat (not to mention the numerous other bad things he's done as president). in fact the only really good thing that came out of bush's presidency was that his unpopularity paved the way for obama to become president.	reagan because he ended the cold war. bush, because he's keeping the terrorist in line.
1	Enlighten me. What evidence came out Monday, Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of this week?	I believe the legal term here is "libel". As in, it's against the law to lie about someone in print and present it as truth. Everyday more and more evidence comes out that the book is full of lies and fabrications.
0	It's probably defensive to some extent on both sides. A lot of atheists I've run into seem to be out to prostlytize as well--they are basically evangelists for the atheist way of thinking. Religiously atheist, you might say. They're looking for opportunities to assert the atheist message. And I've read some pretty darn hateful things said about Christianity right here in these forums, and just chalking it up to be "defending" or "kicking back" doesn't really fly. Who knows who threw the first punch? It's to the point that it doesn't really matter anymore, because both sides should be showing respect.	Well, I'm not an atheist, but I definitely don't believe in the bible. However, I don't think the "atheists" or the non-christian believers promote morality. Our issue is only based in the fact that we are a normal part of society and would very much like to have that respect. On the other side, the fundies say they know what's right for everyone and look at us as reprobrates, condemned... blah blah blah. Don't think we're promoting morality. we're not pedophiles, thieves or evil people.... but we're constantly condemned by the moral christianists. I think our side of the moral issue is more of a knee-jerk reaction to the jerks on the fundie side. If someone kicked you constantly, wouldn't you eventually kick back. The problem with the fundies is that when we kick back, it hurts. But they feel justified in what they do.

0	This is exactly what I said in a pm to her. I also suggested that she talk to women who have had abortions, who have not, who have had adoptions, and who have been adopted. I wish there was some kind of "place" you could go to automatically get this kind of dialogue. Not internet sites, but face to face stuff.Want to start a counseling center? :)	maybe you can postpone it one more week and think about it for one more week, and talk to others that love you (your boyfriend does not count).In the event you keep your appointment on Saturday, all I can say is I'm sorry, that you have to go through this event. I hope you will be okay.
1	what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno	and yet you continue to support the illogic of a potential person having the right to make a slave of a person in being. incredible. and, yes, if i am in a persistent vegetative state, i have authorized my family to direct my physicians to pull the plug. i'm not there.
1	I believe that the theory you speak of is called slavery; everybody is equal because they have nothing and need to work long and hard just to earn the privilege of living in order to serve their masters.	rich people can take away poor peoples freedomthats why marx was so importanthe showed us that goverment can be the great equaliser because if only government owns property then nobody will be rich and we will all be equal

1	You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.  As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?  Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men.	just read the following story. my question is thus, should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child's unruleiness?
0	So given that there are cases where both dies... we just have to give up the mother's right to live over a fetus (which will die)? What if the mother isn't physically ready to have a baby. In the case of a young female (I'm talking age of 9 and younger, cause there are cases of young kids having their periods) being raped, doesn't she a "baby" (and I say baby, because she is still at an age where a parent would consider her their youngin)... have the right to live? For me, if I knew my child was raped and is in no way ready for a child of her own, physically or mentally... I would rather her not risk her life to try and bring that fetus into the world.Abortion should be pro-choice.	It cannot change the way it was created. If the life of the mother is threatened then there is no winner: one will die and one will live or they will both die.
1	Sure keep thinking that way and never mind the millions he put in his pocket. How was someone else put it? A thimble size brain case almost empty.	Edwards sued corporations for the benefit of humans. Just a little fact to twist around in your little contorted mind.
1	And if there's one thing I can count on, it's your insistence that we can assume guilt and should make a public spectacle of the matter before even investigating any matter.	If there's one thing I can count on, it's your insistence on 100%, beyond any possibility of apologetic excuse creation, demand for absolute proof (with video-tape) if anything involves criticism of Christianity or evangelicals or some association thereof...
1	d'ya think i should? make a mel gibson film and suddenly everyone's an expert eh? well despite what his gibson-ness would have us believe, gallipoli was a case of bad luck, incompetence and generals f*cking everyone over regardless of nationality. remember we lost huge numbers of british troops too. now i don't downplay the role of the anzacs, or their losses. but this was at a time when the british considered australians to be one and the same as themselves. there was hardly the conscious effort to use the anzacs as fodder over the tommies. gallipoli was a blunder (though again not as big a blunder as populist history has us believe) for everyone, regardless of nationality. there was certainly no sinister us and them between our nations- we were essentially considered as one.	have you considered a career in advertising? by the way you f***ed us too. australians troops were cannon fodder in wwi for the british empire, remember gallipoli?
1	he is. it is like i sin a few times now i am a satanist. i was not aware that i could not have an opinon without being a satanist. you have been a christian longer: does god hate lying lips?	okay. that is good. but i was asking who he was referring to. was he talking about you?
0	I agree. What is the point? Felons with firearms do not bother with CCW licenses.	CCW LAWS ARE FOR TRACKING GUN OWNERS WHO EXERCISE THIER RIGHTS!!!
1	that wasn't a reason why we fought hitler. in fact, if you will remember many in the states didn't believe that occured until they saw the pictures.  hardly a reason to invade. unless you'd like to flip it around and say that every country who's leader we tried to murder has the same right. emoticonxrolleyes  how is that our problem? oh yes, it's not.  as i recall, we kicked him out, beat him up, put him under sanctions and virtually removed any ability to do anything of revelance.  doesn't that mean we have to invade north korea? emoticonxrolleyes  that's been dealt with already. rehashed arguments are worthless.  huh. stalinist govermemnt. reminds me of the dictators the us put in power in latin america. :) the mass graves also was dealt with. but then again, you clearly do not understand the me culture.	about as much 'soverienty' legitimation as hitler had when he was butchering the jews. no cause? you forget about trying to murder bush #41. no cause? you forget about him funding palestinian terrorists at $25k a pop. no cause? you forget about invading kuwait. no cause? he kicked out the u.n. inspectors. no cause? he fired at our airplanes who patrolled the no-fly zones. no cause? the mass graves and stalinist government? and these are just the things we know for certain.

0	But just try and remove them from those that think we do and you will have a war on your hands. It's too bad we didn't become more like Canada is respect to gun ownership. A lot more people would be alive today and others not sitting in prison for crimes they commited.	Everyone is welcome to give their opinion on public gun possession here-whether you're for or against gun control (or does gun possession justifies itself) and please state the reasons as well. I would really appreciate it if you guys could include some extra informations regarding this issue.

0	No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time.	Your definition is that those creatures with survival advantages and characteristics will survive.
0	'whose illegal war? america isn't even there to be at war anymore!' wow. please tell me you're joking?	'-illegal war in iraq.' whose illegal war? america isn't even there to be at war anymore! we are setting up a government for them! if they are grieving because we are helping the general public to live a more organized life then that's kind of their problem right?  besides; this isn't the debate topic where you should be bringing this up.
0	how did you private insurer determine the coverage in your plan? do they ever make case-by-case determinations not to cover something? i strongly urge you not only to read the house bill and the upcoming senate bill, but also to read your own health insurance plan, in detail, fine print and all, as well as to look into their record of denying claims. it's one of those things that most people don't realize is a problem until it affects them directly, at which point it's too late.	we're still waiting on you to show how the government will determine coverage with your plan. and more importantly, how it will pay for it, specifically. until you clear up that 900 lb elephant, it's all moot. the assumption that we shouldn't give govt. more and more control is the default. you want to change that .... the burden of proof is on you. the govt. has to make determinations--everyone knows that. it's a govt. benefit, after all. the question is, how it will do that.

1	Because the NY Times, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, and Handgun Control are all atheist-lead and anti-Christianity. Yeah.	The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless. Miller continues;
0	Well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution, not as 100% protected but in that gov't cannot mandate a religion. Also, religion is not unilateraly protected, as I've stated several times. There are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise? That being said I have long been a supporter of limited gov't and believe that gov't has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage. They should be silent on the subject.	Why is the CHOICE of religion more worthy of Constitutional protection that any other choice.emoticonXConfused
1	oh yeah..., my fiends did that for me. they had an intervention and they vented. they were pissed me for mercilessly trolling them and it worked. i am now a kinder, gentler, troll ;)	part of me feels the syrians need to fight it out like every other country did, but the other half feels the war needs to be stopped. if there is an intervention, it needs to be done properly. by that i mean no nato countries. the intervention should be made up of arab un troops in blue helmets. this ensures there are no ulterior motives of the forces.
1	howard -  who do you say jesus christ is? the long awaited jewish messiah? your resurrected savior for the remission of your sins? the great god and savior (2 peter 1:1)? simple yes's or no's will suffice. p.s. you can probably buy that book i recommended on your argument at amazon.com.	ez: read some unbiased writings about the early church  say the first 1000 years. i am tired of you running from question and challenges to your thinking.

1	so you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? that someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? what if it where your nipples? after all nipples on men serve no purpose.	i've got no problem with it. geez, your not normal if you don't have it circumcised. some woman won't want you (sexually) because of it. babies don't remember the pain.  and its not just for religious purposes, come on, the main reason is for hygienics . you could get an infection or something at an older age and have to get that done at 15-16 or so on. how painful would it be to get it then.  i am happy i am circumcised, and i am glad my parents did it.

1	Wow ehat a brave new world you live in.... Now lets say just 1% of all gun owners resisted (in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land). With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this?	Would depend on how sucessful they thought the handing in was, but don't you have to register for a leicence? So all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in, I would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon. In addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal, then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime (will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene). Would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up.If there is a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempted murder, would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them, especailly criminals- comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they are carrying a gun while doing it, even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional years.
1	April was "recent" ? Please provide evidence from the memo of these "examples".

0	really? congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; sounds like a requirement to be neutral to me. it could be rephrased: 'don't meddle with religion! do not regulate. neither promote nor inhibit.' why would anyone have a problem with this? and we both know that the limitation of government regulate of rights and liberties is read today, thanks to the 14th amendment, as applying to all legislative authorities in the us, not just congress. no state legislature can establish a state religion either.	nope, read the amendment. it clearly says nothing more than one branch, and one act of governing (making laws). no matter how much you'd love for it to say more. it doesn't say a darn thing about 'remaining neutral'.
0	I'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me. I smell posers.	You wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? How many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?
0	I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.	Can anyone make a rational argument as to why executing a criminal who was 18 years old when committing the crime is not "cruel and unusual punishment," but executing a criminal who was less than 18 at the time of the crime would be cruel and unusual?Put another way, can anyone explain why it is constitutional to execute a person who was 18 years old when they committed the crime, but it is unconstitutional to execute a person who was under 18 when they committed the crime?Participants in this discussion should assume that the death penalty, in general, is constitutional. This has been the case from the beginning of our Republic, and has been reaffirmed multiple times. In other words, it is not an appropriate argument to try and argue that the death penalty, in general, is unconstitutional. That has neither been the case through our history, and is not the current state of the law.*Note: I am speaking within the context of the United States, and its Constitution.
0	No. It steps firmly in the realm of REALITY Jyoshu.Have you never heard people talk about how police in an area respond in X amount of time for one situation, but for a different situation, like in a neighborhood predominantly black or gay or ___, the response time is four times as long?Have you never heard of how there have been cases where people have died because they tried to get medical help at the "white" hospital?Or how about you read about THIS case and tell me that these concerns aren't real...	Let's get real here. The man puts out fires and rescues people. Do you really think he's going to stop and ask people before he carries them out of a burning building "wait . . . are you gay? Because if you are I'm sorry someone else will have to do this." This idea that someone's political and/or ideological view on a public referendum issue should have any bearing on whether he should be allowed to do other things is scary, if you ask me. It's stepping into the realm of thought-police fascism.
0	First off, define "government funded". The FBI? The CIA? Other federal law enforcement agencies? The military? All vital government entities that are and should be armed. The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government.	I'll trust anybody that's not government funded, with a gun. Hell I'd even trust drug dealers sooner than I'd trust the government in terms of being armed. Governments all around the world have killed millions of their own people in genocides after disarming them, proving that government should never be armed.
0	Now you're being ridiculous. The big bang is not the evolution of the universe. The words "evolution of the universe" do not necessarily entail the big bang. For example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.But claiming that the "evolution of the universe" is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?By the way, I have always heard the creationist invention "GTE" referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity.	If someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the "evolution of the universe" because it will just waste time.
1	if the federal government wants to pay for it, fine. the federal government has no business telling private insurance companies how to run their business. especially if they have religious ties. i'm surprised anyone wanted to put their dick inside your rotted out pussy.	if we had federal healthcare, everyone would be paying and everyone would be covered. i'm sorry you're the only person in your life you're capable of thinking about. must be lonely.
0	I don't believe that Orthodox doctrine deals directly with WWII. I am unfamiliar with such. Are you saying that the event you stated had a direct bearing on the cause of the war?Our doctrine would deal with evil, in general. But there may be Orthodox writers who have commented on the war. We are a Church with doctrine, but it would take more than a number of writers commenting on something to make it a 'doctrine'.Armenia was the first nation on earth to adopt Christianity.	Yeah, Stalin was a mess he sent us to Siberia. BTW did Hitler start rounding up you guys too? I think someone here (In my state) was trying to build and Arminian memorial. Oh btw JW's believe that all that bloodshed and peresecution from 1914-to 1919 was due to satan being cast down to earth by Jesus. What does you docterine say?
1	Oh? What keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest?   I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. You wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? How many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?	safer by openly carrying unloaded handguns? that's the law in ca.  of course you can have a loaded magazine or two on the other hip. http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?sec...bay&id=7261522
0	Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic.	i didn't mention evolution in this topic. you did.
1	Aw declare victory and slither off eh. I made an assertof fact that was backed up. You made a strawman of abandonment. No one made that claim but you. They come here because they don't get the proceedure in a timely manner. Get it now? Hence you lose as usual.	You made an assertion of fact, and it is therefore your job to establish its veracity with reputable evidence.The argument from (or "appeal to") ignorance is a logical fallacy which claims that a premise is true ("Canadians are coming over the border for our health system in hoards, while abandoning theirs") only because it has not been proven false.Ergo, you lose.
0	Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning. So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service? Is this some kind of hybrid model? Interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation.	Look over the Heller ruling again. All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.
0	Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage. I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.I think this is an important question, because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect.Until I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt.	We don't take him seriously anymore because despite having been refuted over and over (both here and on at least four other boards), he still posts the same garbage. Whenever it looks like there has been overwhelming refutation of his thread, he abandons it and starts a new one saying basically the same thing as the one before it. THAT is why he isn't taken seriously, and no, it is not "unfair". I also have to ask why you think he puts so much intelligence into his posts, when all he does is either cut and paste from some anti-evolution site, or say things like "science is a joke" My pet dog could do better.
1	You already screwed them over when you decided to cover their country in radioactive dust. Depleted uranium is a real bitch.	So we should just completly screw them over, and let everything we have faught for go down in vain?

0	actually they probably drifted much faster than that.....probably upon a pole reversal.	Yes and the continents moved about 2000-3000 miles in less than 4000 years only about a mile per year. Surely nobody would have made a note of that its such a slow rate of progress! Clearly this is all possible with plate tectonics et al. Thats only about 15 ft per day of movement!
0	Actually, I don't remember that they did. What they did take bets on was that AIG would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe. As I recall, most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so. So now, besides their other so called 'peer reviewed' magazine, they want to pretend that they are doing science here.	But I'm sure that when http://answersingenesis.com came on line, atheists and anti christian bigots all over the internet took bets they would fail just as ripskar is doing now with the creation of this new site.
1	So then how do you know that abortion isn't in the plan then? If as you say we have "VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE"	Precisely, if a master craftsman destroys his finest creation because it is flawed, is he doing something wrong? Or isn't it his right to do what he wishes with his creation. So it is with the maker of all that is. So they may seem like terrible acts from your VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE, but from the perspective of a perfect and holy God, His judgement was a righteous one on all levels. But why would one expect you to get that?
0	Why do you think they feel no emotion? All the women I know who have aborted did so under very difficult circumstances and it was horrible for them.Most women who seek abortion are not unfeeling sluts. They are real women, with real issues, and real circumstances that lead them to that choice. Want to help those babies? Address the issues the women face and don't demonize. No amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother. Dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone.	I find it funny how a person can see how wrong it is to kill a baby after cutting it from a womb, yet they don't think it's wrong while the baby is still in it. That's what baffles me about Pro-choicers(Pro-abortionist). I wonder if there were a glass window allowing people to see what they are killing, if they would still feel no emotion.
1	What! You mean that WE don't want to do all of those things? Who knew? I didn't get the memo? emoticonXConfused   And you forgot "make Seniors eat dog food". emoticonXGood	I know, silly me, I should've realized that the Left would naturally think a Conservative wants to take over the world LOL Along with wanting children to starve, dirty air, etc....I'll have to remember who I'm talking to next time LOL
1	Right, what I think doesn't make you naive or delusional, what you think does.	Well it's your right to think what you want, It doesn't make me naive or delusional because I see things different.
1	I thought you had vowed never to post in this forum again. ????? I suppose with your views on divorce, your wedding vows have as much weight as your vow not to post here.	No....that is incorrect. Divorce has been around for centuries and was used in biblical times when a woman or man cheated on their spouse. Same sex marriage has never received any good stamp of approval in civilized societies.
1	hmmm. 'wow... and this op made it through the rigorous admin review process? anyway, here is a question for you to ponder about. if god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around?' sounds like a joke to me.  evc forum: human evolution (re: if evolved from apes, why still apes?) but we all know that arch is incapable of opening the blue colored links.	http://www.4forums.com/political/360684-post266.html lies,  definition according to archangel: anything archangel does not like.  still pretending that my quotation of taz's joke was not verbatim eh?  still pretending you never said oil wasn't a hydrocarbon eh? thanks for proving my point. i posted the link proving you are wrong and what do you do? pretend it does not exist.
0	If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too. However, you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work.	To add to the obvious costs of pregnancy, there is also the loss of pay as I would not be able to work (I'm a geologist - this involves quite a bit of strenuous outdoors work), which would even further affect us.
0	So what if the author isn't arguing against gun control? At last, there is indication that England has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody isn't the answer to crime.	The author is arguing that gun control in rural areas does not constitute crime control in urban areas but somehow you try to spin that into making it sound as if the author is making some blanket statement against all gun control.
0	british kid with too much time on his hands. oh yeah, and he's a virgin.	you can't be nk. they aren't even allowed to play sports, or do anything. i do wonder what or who you are though.
1	since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes	nope, you've still missed the point. bolding your repetition won't help, either. you said 'all visiting moslems'. not 'all visiting individuals'. specifically investigating 'all visiting moslems' is discriminatory. investigating 'all visiting individuals' is not - well, it is a bit, but less so - and you would not have got this response if you had suggested as such.
1	You mean Priests? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them, can't get enough of that catholic loving...	sure so if it was 2.5 billion or trillion.. ( different scientists) where di we come from? like ya ya ya the big bang.. but where did the pool of amoebas come from? and where did the charge of electricity( lightning bolt) come from? it just is a whole bunch of ideas coming from some fat guys with no women in their life...
1	I am not the origin of anything....I originated in my parents....from where did they originate?	You originated the question above did you not - so there you go. Look in the mirror.
1	I'm not interested in who isn't hitting on you. Do you want an ugly, flaming, gay cellulite blubber-wench hitting on you for three years or not??? Or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you??  For the record, gays make normal men's skin crawl, and not in a good way. So keep the spiritually-challenged heathens out of the men's barracks, and out of their showers. Just because you and the rest of the pro-gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok doesn't mean the rest of society does.	i could care less if i shower with a lesbian. i am sure i have at the gym. one of my olderst friends is a lesbian and we have seen each other naked many times. she has never gawked or hit on me. she knows i am straight. i have been hit on by women and men i am not interested in. i say 'thanks, but no thanks.' i have only ever had one lesbian contnue after that, the number of men that wouldn't let it rest are beyond count. but overall, i think women have a lot more tact in such matters. as to the whole naked thing. we are so puritanical about nudity in the us. when i spent a month in finland i saw people of all sizes, ages, colors and genders naked all the time due to the saunas and jumping into lakes. it was in no way sexual. as far as separating men and women's showers i mostly see that as a safety issue for women. sexual assualt is a very real danger for women (1 in 3 will experience it in her lifetime). although i believe most men are not rapists, especially those in uniform, having men and women shower together has the potential of putting women in a very vulnerable situation as most men are physically stronger than most women.  i don't believe this. i am as worried about it as i am that stepping on a crack will break my mother's back. stop fretting. gay men probably find homophobes about as appealing a black woman would find a memeber of the kkk. hell, i am a straight woman and find your ignorance and paranioa of the matter decidedly unattractive.  neo-con, religious wing nuts. they are so entertaining.
0	So, you're saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you'd leave right?	yeah, i know...like many religions, people just claim they are one and then think they can just pick and choose what to follow. To me, you are all or nothing so those that think the Pope is an idiot should probably consider a new faith because they don't believe in the one they say they do.
1	From the threads I see, you would be banned in 10 posts, and everything deleted.

1	Now you are being insulting. Evolution makes no statments about your god. For that matter, neither does cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics or geology.	Evolution is basically a naturalisitic way of explaining how everything could come into being without the need for a Creator God.

1	i would ask you for a link, but this time i'm not feeling generous.  didn't you know that there are about 2.5 million cases of gun self defence annually, in about 92% of those cases nobody was harmed? does this even compare to the microscopic 102,200 deaths (don't tell me that's, wrong thats the very number that your cult has been using, comrade) that the brady fanatics have been whining about? your stats are simply untrue.	the risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns.[3] the risk of suicide is five times greater in households with guns.[4] what's more, tragic stories of accidental or unintentional shootings from the careless storage of guns at home are all too common. the statistic noted above bears repeating: a gun in the home is 22 times more likely to be used in a criminal, unintentional, or suicide-related shooting than to be used in a self-defense shooting. [5] putting your family in all that danger because youre nuts about guns is immoral
0	Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA.	The genetic difference between human and his nearest relative, the chimpanzee, is at least 1.6% Calculated out that is a gap of at least 48 million nucleotide differences that must be bridged by random changes.

0	You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to.The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable. The promised veto threat didn't matter in this instance. He was "standing on principle." Well, same would apply for his newfound views disfavoring DOMA as well in my view.	Said repeal would have to be signed by the President, right? I trust you haven't forgoten who currently holds that position, or how likely his signature would be?

0	Actually, it hasn't. Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam's Razor. Further, DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences. It isn't that the DNA is different, what matters is the the sequence of the bases is different.	But that can be tested at whatever level you want to use for "kind" and shown to be false. Has been shown to be false by phylogenetic analysis. No application of the mistaken Razor.

1	Yes but its like sharks when there is blood in the water. Plus I at least do this for fun and why should I not get in my own ideas and have my fun with creationists. They are getting pretty rare you know. Can't let those other rationalists keep them all to themselves. emoticonXAgree	It is difficult, considering anywhere from 5 to 15 or even 20 "rationalists" will go into a posting frenzy against one creationist quite often at these forums. Can't just one do the job?
1	oh cc, apparently, 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow. We can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone, we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad ( although, I have her beat by 4 years and counting, still happy and going) We have the power. We are gay, ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say (ask jaaman for more info)	Apparently gay marriage is more threatening than unmarried gay couples are. The point about legalizing gay households is certainly puzzling unless one contends that cohabitation is illegal (which it isn't). But just in case I'm wrong, perhaps the authorities should be notified of all the heterosexual unmarried couples and they should be hauled off to jail.
0	Very well said, but remember, Evolution doesnt mean atheism, but creationism means religion. I know Christians that believe in evolution, but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism.	Each side tries to support their own worldview. There are two positions, and sides are chosen. It's human nature. Yes. :) I can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the Bible suggests, but I don't believe in doing it in a forceable way. I don't believe one person / one event wins a convert all at once, it takes a combination of many tiny little steps (examples) to win converts. My main reason for posting here is political. I don't believe it's possible to have neutrality in government. If church & state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Atheism almost always equals secular "progression", and Judeo Christianity almost always equals tradition, according to unchanging Biblical morals. The two quickly clash in politics. Also, I don't believe future generations (school children) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough. I enjoy written debates very much, and I'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the U.S. government, in violation of the text of the First Amendment and intent of the framers. I believe there has to be a God because I see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generated from non living chemicals.I was brought up without anyone forcing me what to believe, and went to church occasionally. My church attendance didn't get very regular until my late twenties - about twenty years ago. A few Bible studies, comparing it to the flow of events, the nature of people, my shortcomings, the shortcomings of science etc, convinced me. Though it doesn't really say why, the Bible says that is what will happen. See Matthew 7 :13,14. It's part of God's plan. Free will.

1	Is that right next to ANWR? Are the Canadians downplaying ANWR while they side drill to extract our precious fluids? emoticonXClown	I was doing some work with a friend of mine at the Geological Survey of Canada on Friday, and the topic of ANWR came up. Apparently the Canadian Gov't is in the middle of a large study of the hydrocarbon reserve potential in the Mackenzie/Beaufort region right now. It's internally confidential, and, seeing as how I work for an oil/gas company, he couldn't give me details.Suffice to say, in his opinion, it didn't look real promising, data was very limited, and given what was available, any estimates are pretty shaky. His biggest concern was that the source rocks appeared immature.Waxy
0	Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference.	In class I have to debate why if we were to start a new country why it should be socialistic. I don't want this to turn into a debate, I only wants links and reasons on why we should go socialistic over capitalistic.Thanks for helping.*REMINDER* please do not turn this into a debate!

0	I don't think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do. The father is supplying his DNA when he engages in sexual relations. After than point he has in effect signed a blank check. It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime. Fathers to be shouldn't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check. I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years.	I agree... it's just too bad sometimes with young adults they don't think about what might happen, they just respond with natural urges. And this results sometimes is someone becoming " with child " even though it was not what they set out to do!So should we force them to have the child and put it up for adoption? If so consider there are lots of children waiting to be taken in and most of them aren't infants.
0	No it doesn't!It cost way more money in appeals than it does to excute someone. WE the taxpayers pay for legal represenatation for them and us, plus the cost of keeping them in jail. The appelas process alone costs the tax payers millions.It is far more expensive to kill them than to leave them in jail with no chance of parole.	I don't know what exactly to think of it only I think it saves us the cost of prisons!
1	and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES.	Among homosexual men in particular, casual sex, rather than committed relationships, is the rule and not the exception. And even when they do enter into a more committed relationship, it is usually of relatively short duration. For example, a study of homosexual men in the Netherlands (the first country in the world to legalize "marriage" for same-sex couples), published in the journal AIDS in 2003, found that the average length of "steady partnerships" was not more than 2 < years (Maria Xiridou et al., in AIDS 2003, 17:1029-1038).

0	this has nothing to do with my post. you don't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy. i'm an advocate of science, and even i admit that, especially at the quantum level, shit gets crazy. particles being in two places at once, 95% of the universe being undetectable, whole separate universes colliding to make new ones. it's crazy yes, but it is also scientific. in fact, compared to science, the answers psychics provide are rather boring. i'm impressed by the stuff i just listed, not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog.	dude you need to realize this: if the claims i make are true, which i believe they are, then that means all the most crazy, outlandish, extreme conspiracies, are true. this is why society would have such a hard time believing it is real. not because they dont want to travel interdimensionally, but because it would mean believing in what those 'crazy nutjobs' believe in, do you realize this? all conspiracies are tied in to hide this one fact. conspiracy theorists never look that far back, but when you start looking that far back, it makes alot more sense.

0	...well...in the last decade or so we've been starving them to death. where have you been? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being. i'll grant you that. in the case of your c-section question, i think the mother should have the section, but we can never compell her to do so. it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate.	i do understand that, but equally those who are pro-life would doubtless think differently. possibly in the example you gave, but what of a very late pregnancy, one that is not an early fetus and could easily exist if a csarian for example were performed? self-aware too is not necessarily a get-out clause. what of people in deep comas who are arguably not self-aware either? or for that matter a baby, when does ones concept of 'self' actually begin? but it can be argued that the impact on the child's life is significantly greater than that on the parents. existance is after all pretty much the biggest impact on anyone. to be fair i'm playing devil's advocate here really, as i am broadly pro-choice myself. i was just struck by the similarity of the arguments in 'the parents right to choose ends when it affects the child's life'.

0	the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not, and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature. i'm not arguing that i believe in a rapture, but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event. i hope you see the difference	lol. this entire argument is so inane.  it's entirely based on the assumption that the bible is true. obviously that is the fallacy of begging the question.  the bible as a whole is unverifiable, and for all we know was written back in the day by a guy who overdosed on opium.  the idea of rapture is completely irrevelant until the bible is verified as fact.

0	separate but equal is never equal? which are better? boys' or girls' bathrooms? other than that last statement i agree 100%. i don't believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we wanted them to be. unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefining marriage and for civil unions never want to give gays all the rights of marriage in a civil union.	hm. to me that sounds frighteningly similar to something that could be heard several decades ago: 'our schools should only teach white children. we don't hate gays or anything, we just oppose having them in schools with our children, it just isn't possible to us to allow them in our school. we aren't really opposed to them going to school, we'll support that as long as they go to their own school for blacks and aren't allowed in our white schools. allowing them in the white schools is just silly.'  i'm sorry, but just like what was decided back then, seperate but equal is never equal. basically they are saying that gays are somehow inferior and have to be put in their own instisution lest they sully the institution of marriage (something heteros are doing without anyone else's help).
1	I suppose Piltdown Man was the product of newspapers, cute indeed!	Wrong again. The tooth was never formally described or published. While the discoverer may have thought it was a human tooth, it was a newspaper that reported the find as being some race of human. Actually it was after further finds were made that it was realized that the tooth wasn't human. Again, it was never claimed by science to be a race of man. No description and no publishing means that it was never presented foramlly to science.You creationaries are so cute. You have to keep pretending that this kind of thing is meaningful. It is meaningful only to reveal the integrity of creationaries and christianaries.
0	Well sigma, which is more painful??

OR   A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. It has just as much feeling as the mother.	i'm not exactly sure your point with this article. was it merely to show that pro-choice groups exaggerate claims? that they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side? trust me, you have told me nothing new. in fact, i am somewhat amused that you pointed this out, given that pro-life groups are guilty of all this and more. it said: although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant, powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make . i almost peed myself laughing when i read this. whatever powerful, emotional images you believe pro-choice are guilty of, pro-life groups are many times worse. what is the mental image of a deceased young woman compared to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus'? i have seen pro-life groups holding huge posters outside high-schools, and pro-life groups hold them up in front of clinics. how much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attacking the other? the article speaks of fallacies yet fails to mention the statement of 'abortion is wrong because it's murder!' that pro-life people seem very fond of. this is the exact fallacy the article mentions, using an unproven point (abortion is murder) to hold up an unproven point (abortion is wrong). i point this out not to absolve pro-choice groups of guilt, but to say: before pointing fingers, make sure your own house is in order. this entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well. the argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions (per se). as i see it, since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned, the complaint is that pro-life people would rather see more women hurt (and yes, more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal) than actually solve the problems with society. to ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women.  if you would, chloe, please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions? i’m amazed they managed to eek out numbers, given that not even the cdc has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked. the most compelling evidence i’ve seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after, corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods. they found little change in the birth rates, indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease. yes, i know pro-choice groups mislead with stats and figures. this is nothing new, but i feel it is dishonest to point this out without acknowledging your own groups shortcomings in the same area.

What part about people burning in hell for eternity?	so what is the bible then? simply a nice story-book for you to read from? if genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution, what about the ten commandments? it always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of genesis or the arc, but god really does hate the homosexuals. it says so in leveticus, right? so it must be word perfect truth... this bit about the origins of the earth? oh, we just interpret that as god designing evolution. but that part about people burning in hell for eternity, that's true, right?
0	Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.   IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes.	Your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed.If the chance of mutation A happening is one in a billion, and the chance of mutation B happening is also one in a billion, then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is, as you say, beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.However, we're not talking about a single gene. A population of a billion bacteria is nothing unusual, and all of them will contain the same gene. So while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation A are very low, the odds of one of them experiencing it are pretty high. The lottery works on the same principle. You probably won't win, but someone probably will.Ok, so now we have our billion bacteria, one of which possesses mutation A. However, the odds of mutation B stacking with it are still only 1 in 1,000,000,000.Now, if mutation A isn't particularly helpful, that's probably the end of the story. But if mutation A is helpful, then that bacterium will outcompete its peers for resources, and breed more readily than they do - either better in absolute terms, or better in immediate proximity, when in competition for the same resources. Either way, the proportion of the population possessing mutation A will increase until they predominate. Now there isn't just one copy of the A-mutant gene in circulation, there are about a billion, and the odds of mutation B stacking with just one of them are greatly improved. Once again, if mutation B is helpful the descendents of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population, so that in a relatively short time (a few hundred bacterial generations) a single cell possessing neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possessing not one but two billion-to-one mutations - a population ready for the next billion-to-one mutation to occur, and stack, and flourish, and so on.I hope that helps.
1	no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. sorry dear, ad hominems do nothing. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. i apologize i sound that way. i certainly know what i am referring to in the bible, and knowing that you have admitted you don't necessarily follow the whole bible (god > bible) i figured i wouldn't assume you believed in genesis adam and eve. but rather give you the option to say yes or no.  god didn't want us to be puppets.  i didn't necessarily say puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted -and if they did love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets. so god was performing some twisted reverse psychology on adam and eve?	no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. god didn't want us to be puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted - and if they didn't want to love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets.
1	Why am I not surprised chester, that chloe directly giving an in depth answer to you is perceived as not being germane to the topic. Since you never directly answer any proposition forwarded as you derail every thread by just serving up your off topic tripe. emoticonXGood	Because it is not germane to the topic under discussion and is nothing more than an attempt to hijack the forum into a discussion that is already present in another thread.If after chloe answers my question, which was first, she wants to have that discussion in the appropriate forum, I will be more than happy to oblige her.
0	I'm sure the racist white segregationists after Plessey thought exactly as you do now, "That settles the matter."Little Louise Brown had a big SURPRISE!!! for them.You still have not walked upon the thin ice of the "well regulated" wording, we note.	Oh really? Some day a court case is going to come around and it's ultimately going to be decided that the Second Amendment isn't an individual right but rather a collective one? What'll keep new court cases from coming up now that there's precedent and the ultimate determination will be that nobody in the country has any rights of any sort?
0	That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress.	I can't claim originality for this proof, but I have never heard any good refutation of it.
0	Though I know you directed this question at Cthulhu, I will nonetheless jump in to say that I would quickly choose the newborn mentally retarded baby to live and the zygote to die. That is obvious to me since the mentally retarded baby is a currently existing person vs. the zygote being merely a potential person. That zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present. I would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person (now merely a cell) to die.	Let me pose a hypothetical question.Same scenario as yours above but instead there is a genetically normal zygote on one table or on the other table, there is a mentally retarded newborn baby...which one will you choose if you had 2 seconds to choose?
0	I disagree. I've been in a loving, committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively...how does this have a negative affect on you?	The more we seek to redefine marriage, and chip away at God's original design for the home, the more we put our families and our nation at risk.How do you know what God's original design for the home was? How do you know that God didn't create homosexuals for a reason (i.e. helping raise children of people who can't care for them)? How is allowing 2 people who commit to love eachother for life putting heterosexual families and the nation at risk? At risk from what?This debate about gay marriage is really just the latest outgrowth of a culture that for decades has been drifting from biblical standards of truth and morality. The sexual revolution, for example, sought to bring legitimacy to sex outside of marriage. The women's liberation movement worked to revolutionize the roles of men and women in marriage and in our society. Throw in a rising emphasis on materialism and personal happiness, and you end up with a dramatically new way of looking at marriage.When millions of Americans view marriage from the mindset of “What's in it for me?” concepts like responsibility, self-sacrifice, and lifelong commitment become secondary. Is it any wonder that our divorce rate is so high? Or that the number of children born outside of marriage continues to rise? Or that an increasing number of couples are opting to live together instead of marrying?And now the push for gay marriage seeks to redefine marriage even further. From the moment God created marriage, it was designed with a man and woman in mind. God designed two sexes male and female—He did not create four sexes. Homosexual marriage cannot fulfill God's purposes for marriage.I realize we are not all Christians here. However, this issue of gay marriage transends all of society and it will have a negative effect on all of us. JMHO.
0	Holy grail implies it is like a religion, which it is not. If evidence is found that overturns this theory, it will be discarded in favour of a better one.	Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began.
0	You are the only one defending them now...the funny part it, planned parenthood had the stats as reasons why abortion should be legal (or is legal). But wait! As we established the number of people that died from abortions went down to under a thousand so this reason is still not accurate and is still misleading. Anymore ideas?	Think twice about that. You come on here strutting your stuff that Planned Parenthood is lying or misleading and now everyone can see that you are the one who is misleading. Now isn't that ironic!
0	I think that scientists don't work with religion and religion has no place in science class.	The evolutionist zealots are essentially pushig to remove any possible religous connotation from evolutionary teaching. The YEC folks want to remove any reference to science from the debate.
1	Did the bill include burning heretics at the stake, stoning them out of the village or removing a women's right to vote?	RTL backed three bills that were recently passed in the Georgia Senate:One requires an ultrasound prior to abortion.Another protects pharmacists if they refuse to fill prescriptions for drugs that end pregnancies.The third allows prosecutors to charge people with causing the death of a fetus, REGARDLESS OF THE STAGE OF PREGNANCY.*******************I think the first will make legal abortions more expensive and will add to the number of backroom botchjobs, the second will have little affect on anything, the third will renew the argument relating to when life begins.
0	So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. It was all about how they could keep women down. Tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?	The criminalization of abortion was the real abuse of power. It was mostly done by a few sexist and political oppertunist members of the AMA to stop women from practicing medicine and by xenophobic/racist Protestant groups who feared a non-white/non-Protestant majority here in America after the Civil War cleared out many of them.

1	No, but I read some of the evidence and it looked pretty solid. If this person was sentenced to life in prison without parole would you question the verdict?	Guilty of the rapes I'm not disputing (don't know anything about those cases), but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed?
0	That's a completely different issue jo. If those pro gay sites were accurately translating and interpreting the bible as it intended itself to be translated, I would accept it with open arms. But how can I accept the lies that homosexual apologists attempt to tell by distorting Gods truth in order to justify their sin? You should understand that I can't allow that rather than you using those corrupted sources in order to support what you personally want the bible to say. I welcome anyone to take the content of the links that tell each story within my link above, and disregard the info if any opposing info is found regarding the claims they make. But just attacking it because it's a jewish source is ridiculous.	You do exactly the same thing, you frequently talk about "gay apologist websites" with reference to translations of the Bible that son't condone your homophobia.
0	That's the thing, though; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts. supersport, on the other hand, doesn't know any better.	That's really all I have to offer to this debate, hopefully somebody will help verify/strengthen my points, seeing as I'm hardly the expert.
0	What I've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper & deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. They stay quietly in the background-computer base -until, as you said: Hopefully, the person "finds some way of forgiving themselves", right. But what about in the mean-time? - And we know, from research & quite a number of Healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.Much better to life benevolently, in the first place.Annie	Abortions hurt much more than they heal. Not just phsyically (Side effects can occure months afterward) but psychologically as well. Guilt, depression, so forth. In my view, abortion is murder, one way or the other and rare extreme cases don't justify its legality. Even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does. They're at least alive while they kill their baby. That in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves.I believe these testimonies to be real, and I feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations' reputations to kill their own child. It really is sad.

0	A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.	asahi.com????????Unloaded rifle on TV triggers controversy - EnglishOTSU, Shiga Prefecture--Given this nation's strict gun control law, were police overreacting when they swooped on a TV broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast?The Shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights, but TV networks are outraged, citing the fact the weapon was not loaded.The incident stems from a show aired Jan. 17 by Biwako Broadcasting Co. Almost four months later, police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items, including a script and a DVD of the show.Critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives, but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant.Shiga prefectural police regard the incident, in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed TV personality Noburo Harada, 57, to momentarily handle the rifle during the show, as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms.So much so, in fact, that on June 12, the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors. As a result, the hunter, aged 49, along with a 60-year-old TV producer and a 37-year-old director of the show, could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law.Police did not pursue a case against Harada even though he briefly handled the weapon. Police argued that he did not actually "possess" the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast.Police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken.The show, called "Tokimeki Shiga'S," is broadcast one Saturday a month. In the show, Harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide.The program in question was set in Yogo, where Harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat. The hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene. He offered the unloaded weapon to Harada and asked,"Do you want to hold it?"Harada held the rifle and commented, "It's heavy, isn't it?" adding, "Not everybody has a chance to hold it, right?"He held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back.Biwako Broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised.The TV crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting.The prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer.The intervention by the police flabbergasted Harada and employees of other TV stations."I never could have imagined anything like this," Harada, a former member of the male comedy duo Anonenone, told reporters after he was questioned by police on June 2. "I was stunned."Akihiko Ito, head of the TV station's programming department, said the station would cooperate with police, but defended Harada's actions."We consulted our lawyers, and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it," he said.A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police."They should have at least asked (Biwako Broadcasting) to cooperate voluntarily," a spokesperson said. "From a common sense standpoint, we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking."An employee at another TV station was also critical."If we, for example, were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife, would the police investigate us, too?" the employee asked. "Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs. This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming."But police say they don't understand what all the fuss is about. They say the media has, by focusing on the celebrity angle, blurred the facts in the case.A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle, but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of "storage and management."An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law, which took effect in January.The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007. The man, known for erratic behavior, committed suicide after the shooting.The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate."I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger," another police official said.According to the National Police Agency, police can file a case against anybody if he or she, with criminal intent to kill or injure people, possesses a weapon for even a second.A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession, but on the purpose of possession, the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner.The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show.By transporting the gun to the show, the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit, police asserted.They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue--did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon?Takaaki Hattori, professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, says that police went too far."The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing. I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law," he said. "They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities."But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent."The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show. The gun owner may have been primarily responsible, but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law."Takaaki Matsumiya, professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto, disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities.Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967, he said: "The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession,'" he said. "There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation. Harada did not 'possess' it (during the show)."Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set."When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm, it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm," he said. "It is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances."(IHT/Asahi: July 2,2009)Now then, what's all this bull**** about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to America? I don't see such being the case, do you? If you can't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law, that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else.How can Japan be so much better off than we are, if it's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep; especially when it's unloaded!?
0	See above. Whether a couple is or isn't monogomous is not for you to determine or worry about. And speak for yourself if you don't mind. This member of the American public's mental health is just fine thank you very much. If gay marriage impacts YOU that much, well that sounds like your problem.	So if same-sex relationships are legally recognized as "marriage," the idea of marriage as a sexually exclusive and faithful relationship will be dealt a serious XXXX. Adding monogamy and faithfulness to the other pillars of marriage that have already fallen will have overwhelmingly negative consequences for Americans' physical and mental health.
0	i'm not playing word games. you said congress doesn't have the power to declare war; how else am i supposed to read that? you meant congress doesn't run the war...you clarified, end of story.	you can stop with the word games, you know very well what i'm talking about. but i will clarify.. congress has the power to declare war...  but congress cannot make war..  you are implying that congress can go into session and just vote for a declaration of war without the president being involved. it may give them this power under the constitution but the constitution is vague at best and in the absence of a clear directive they normally follow the precedent that was set by the first declaration of war... and since every single time we have issued a declaration of war the president of the u.s. initiated it that is the precedent we follow. and let me add.. the president can veto a declaration of war as well.

You're misrepresenting what I said (which is dishonest on your part) and then basically accusing me of not having honesty in your next sentence ... Why is it dishonest to want marriage and govt. separated? I've told you my stance--that's what it is.  I think the real problem is that you just enjoy being belligerent and doing things like calling people "weasel" and "dishonest" when you yourself misrepresent like you did above. I have a better idea--drop the sniveling "you're-a-weasel" playground name-calling antics and start stepping up to the plate and debate the issues. If you think my stance is not a good one for the country, give some reasons. So far all you've done is basically given the equivalent of "that-would-never-work" and that's pretty much it. That, and a bunch of play-school-type insulting.

1	And of course, the theory of gravity isn't "physically" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the "Out of Africa" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense.	5) Moving on, if we look teh other way, evolution is actually a theory not physically proven, one of it s theory suggested that human started out in Africa while another in Asia, but if u look at them none resembles the other and none have a characteristic of an animal.

1	It's a lot easier to kill someone with a gun than a cigarette or a beer.	I have posted this before, but I will post it again to filter out the digressive posts of the anti-gun people... I guess they were hoping to change the subject to something they could debate, but it didn't seem to work, now did it?Statistically, tobacco kills nine times as many people as all homicides and gun accidents combined, and alcohol kills almost twice as many as die in gun-related deaths. (src)Even if you count suicides (assuming every single one of them was with a gun, which they weren't), alcohol still kills more people. So, if your intention is to save lives, then why don't you ban this stuff? Could it have something to do with the fact that you enjoy alcohol and tobacco?
0	I'm not claiming any omnipotent deciever. I'm not sure where you derive 'probability' from, or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses.And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.	One other point: Say that the laws of physics (which are derived from mutual human experience) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes. If these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time, then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment? It all comes down to probability - if things are not what we expect they are from Science, then that should have manifested itself by now.

1	Sounds like someone could be lying... hmmm who could it be? emoticonXIc	So you respond with yet another fundie website. While it is technically correct that Kinsey thought there were only a small number of completely homosexual people, he reported exactly the same about heterosexuals - he claimed that most people were somewhere on a contiuum between homo and hetero sexuality. Surveys always underreport the number of gay people because there is still a social stigma attached to being gay. Many surveys report that even those who have engaged in same-sex activity usually consider themselves straight.
1	I sincerely doubt any of that happened. If so you would have links. Yea we know you are cyber brave to the point of heroine status. You are a troll pure and simple.	Oh good grief!I have always lived in rough areas. In one city, Alburquerque, a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where I slept, and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun.Where I worked, less than a block away, a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place.I was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an ER, I didn't know the stupid beast, I was scared to death, but I felt it my Christian duty (even though I am not a Christian) to get the guy to where he could get treatment.And I don't own a damned gun because I am not chicken-hearted.
0	I'm not surprised.   That's a typical response when someone calls your bluff.   Waxy	do your own research. i am not interested in playing a game.
0	You answered the first one already... it is a 'cartoon'. It showed that just as one was out-lawed, the other was born. You decide what to believe from this.By the way..."Lockheed Martin is a global leader in the design, development and production of missiles and missile defense solutions for the United States and its allies around the world. The goal: Defend against attacks by ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and other airborne threats."http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/fi...=0&ti=0&sc=400	What are you talking about ample time? I starting following this tread last afternoon? What is your point?1) Did the NRA and KKK ever burn a cross together?2) Does Lockheed Martin in Colorado build nukes, missiles, and bombs?3) Did Chuck Heston ever say "From my cold dead hands in Denver"?4) How many edits does it take to make a point? If it is a documentry then why minipulate a speech?1) That is a cartoon? Do you believe in cartoons? My nephew believes that things he sees in Bugs Bunny is real. Do you? Moore manufactured a monster from the NRA.You were manipulated.
1	Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want "guilty by association" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice.	Hence why I stated so. The problem is that you are a XXXXX who can't understand what people write. This has been proven numerous times.
1	Yes none of the organs flown in from Africa or India would be farmed from murdered people, would they?	If I ever ran on a platform like this i'm positive i'd never get elected, but I still think they're some mighty good ideas:1) Organ markets. Legalize the buying and selling of human organs and save not only a ton of lives, but tons of money by cutting down on medical expenses like kidney dialysis..
0	Actually, it isn't. It is complex and complicated. It requires diligent study of difficult concepts. But when you grasp the basics, it does become evident. But most creationists aren't willing to put in the effort.	It is so easy, so simple, so evident is not it?
0	Actually I didn't even read it (and doubt I ever will). Don't get all worked up over it.	ON the subject of your starting arguments, I notice you selectively ignored my view that I posted. Couldn't come up with an argumentemoticonXAngel ?
1	.. I pointed it out in capitals in the hope that it may help you understand the point...did it work? Who knows	And this was important for you to point out in capitals because......?
1	So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.	Agreed, when the husband is part of a hetero relationship. Gay husband is not a legally recognized category.Agreed, when the wife is part of a hetero relationship. Gay wife is not a legally recognized category.Agreed, when the spouse is part of a hetero relationship. Gay spouse is not a legally recognized category.
1	whatever happened to the unborn baby? No consulting him or her I guess. Even though the unborns body is being is the one being torn apart.	So sorry to butt in, but I would think that yes, what the woman wants is all that matters since it's her body and her ...well, this has been gone over a hundred times. It would be 'nice' to consult the man responsible but ultimately it's up to the woman since it's her body, she's the one stuck with the unwanted burden and blah blah...you know.
1	how about small cute animals? whare is the line of what religion allows, and law forbids? we know it is not where harm comes to another person, or poligamy would be legal	Um, that would be murder, which is against the law and does harm the person being murdered.A union between 2 mutually loving people doesn't even begin to compare to that.
0	Same in the US. The father does not have the right to choose.	As it stands in the uk a father has no sat whatsoever in the welfare of the baby/fetus if his partener wants to terminate he need never even be told.
0	Actually I don't deal with spanish or french because I don't have to. I speak english. emoticonXRolleyes	I see you Americans deal as loosely with the French and Spanish languages, as you do with English!Surely it is something like Viva Libertad , or Vive la Liberte, but Viva La Liberty  ????? emoticonXRolleyes :) Leo
0	that's not because of something i did. that's because of something that happened back in the 1950s, i believe. that's fine--go ahead and be offensive! it will only hamper your efforts because it only makes people angry at you when you belittle things they hold dear. but what about religious people that aren't out to do that to you and your family? if the govt. endorses a religion, remove the endorsement! that's fine. you're still willing to be offensive to all religious people because of fundamentalists (which are really the ones doing what you describe!). you can be as offensive and show as much lack of respect as you want. it's only going to make it harder on you to convince people.	if you really respected my belief, or lack thereof, my kids wouldn't be asking me what god is because they hear it in the pledge and read it on our money. they wouldn't be constantly bombarded with your beliefs when it's against my own that they be taught such rubbish. everywhere that atheists try to strip the government's endorsement of a belief in god we are fought be theists in their attempt to maintain this endorsement. if you really respected my belief you'd keep yours to yourself without trying to spread it to me and my family. until then, i'll continue to promote the fact that the 'big invisible guy in the sky' is just another fairy tale.
0	So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.	It turns out, the Johns Hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life."What we now know is that in the event of miscoding, the ribosome cuts the bond and aborts the protein-in-progress, end of story," says Rachel Green, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and professor of molecular biology and genetics in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "There's no second chance." Previously, Green says, molecular biologists thought the ribosome tightly managed its actions only prior to the actual incorporation of the next building block by being super-selective about which chemical ingredients it allows to enter the process.Because a protein's chemical "shape" dictates its function, mistakes in translating assembly codes can be toxic to cells, resulting in the misfolding of proteins often associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Working with bacterial ribosomes, Green and her team watched them react to lab-induced chemical errors and were surprised to see that the protein-manufacturing process didn't proceed as usual, getting past the error and continuing its "walk" along the DNA's protein-encoding genetic messages."We thought that once the mistake was made, it would have just gone on to make the next bond and the next," Green says. "But instead, we noticed that one mistake on the ribosomal assembly line begets another, and it's this compounding of errors that leads to the partially finished protein being tossed into the cellular trash," she adds.
0	Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity? It sounds to me that this "new" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find. ...*Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected inthe adapted strains.*...	We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .
1	so your saying dr. tiggerroo, that my parents decided i would be gay for me. fascinating. do you have any other amazing rubbish to spit out of your mouth. i am captivated by your amazing intelligence on this subject. it sound like you have been studying this all through kindergarden. grow up, get a clue.	honey, the fabulouslness of my being can be nothing but natural! [snap]
1	I don't care for the respect of utter nincompoops. I'm happy to tolerate them, but don't expect me not to laugh at them.	You can hardly expect respect if you are not prepared to give any
0	That's not evidence, that's an assertion. As for my dogs (cats), yes. They do put on a winter coat in the much warmer winter climate than Arizona in which I live. So I return to my original question, on what evidence do you base your claim that an arctic fox would not change color in the winter in Arizona?	temperature, cold. Tell me, if you took your dog to the arizona desert, do you think it would it would put on a winter's coat? If it had a winter's coat do you think it would keep it?
0	Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically. (and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal)	It's been a long standing standard that if the only motivation for a law, act, etc is religious, then it's a violation of SOCAS. If a proposed law just happens to agree with your religion, or if religion is just one small part of the motivation, then it's not a problem. But if you take out religion and you're left with pretty much nothing, then you've got an issue.
0	So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much. So we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can.	"There'll be cheering for our results on the pro-life side and denouncing us angrily on the pro-choice side, Neither of those positions is sound."
0	It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific.	For you, you seem to be suggesting that truths in the physical world can only be gathered by scientific means.
0	Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem. Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected, and America is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes. However   Ms. Feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control  did not help the creditability problem either. I guess only time will tell.	Gun sales are booming nationwide — and in Erie County, applications for pistol permits are rolling in at nearly three times last year's rate, the county clerk's office reports. Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, gun control has become, in essence, dead on arrival. Chalk it all up to the election of a Democratic president with a long record of supporting gun restrictions and a Congress that includes a surprising number of pro-gun Democrats from rural areas. The election of Barack Obama as president is sparking a run on firearms and ammunition in both Buffalo and nationwide, according to gun dealers and experts on the issue.
1	'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful"? What a giant load of steamy BS. Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening. There are over 6 Billion people on this earth today. If motherhood was so damn dangerous, don't you think the population would be a lot lower, even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth? Where do you get this BS from, Planned Parenthood?	Well said Jito. I don't understand why pro-lifers dismiss pregnancy as easy and/or suggest that it's a wonderful snuggly thing that's just the best thing in the world. Even if you want a baby, it's unbelievably hard to go through and something your body never fully recovers from. If you don't want a baby and are being forced to go through it, it's unbearable. You can't force somebody to go through this life-threatening condition that is always physically harmful.
1	Well, the antichrist is going to come and make any true believer a heretic any way so what am I worried about? I knew the risks before I accept the job. :-)	They would say that you weren't a real Christian as well. That all it takes is to believe, or accept Christ into their lives in order to be "saved". And since they are the majority that would make you and your kind heretics. Anybody got a match and a stake? :)
0	Really? Do all your views depend on somebody else changing them for you?	personaly against... Like to have my mind changed thoughemoticonXGood
1	Sorry but I don't read your posts, do you think I worship your word or something?	I explicitly told you I was a catholic before 'converting' to objectivism, so forgive me for not being impressed with your powers of speculation. That doesn't change the fact that this was all well before I signed onto this forum so I know xcaliber has no quotes. I do not 'lean that way' just because I reject irrational evolution. I did not learn this skepticism from my catholic upbringing, as noted several times Catholics are ambiguous towards evolution.
1	Hoo boy! That target just got larger. You still don't get it, do you? Not a "slave contract," but a covenant, a promise :)	Yeah, a slave contract that would be illegal to enforce in any other situation. And luckily, is illegal to enforce in most (all?) advanced nations today. You want to revert back to taliban-like legislation?
0	********. Utter fraking ****. Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor. You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians.	First off the single common ancestor model has no demonstratable mechanism for how it is even possible. For another thing no substantive reasoning that all scientists use is empirically testable which is why subjective/objective duality is the philosophy of natural science. There is only a need to discern between the substantive reasoning (theoretical) and empirical testing (demonstrative). Objectivism is based on substantive reasoning just like scientific positivism or natural selection for that matter. None of these things are subject to peer review since there is a distinction between subjective and objective reasoning.
1	Dear smiling, friendly, forgiving Archangel:  I would be quite happy to respond to you if you could organize your incoherent mental states into logical, debatable points. Please refer to Chester's Questions for Bible-thumpers for guidelines.  As for staying on topic: since there is no God, it is rather pointless to have religious ceremonies in any case, isn't it?  As for my nom de Web, you have missed the point altogether. Either you are not quick on the uptake and/or you are completely ignorant of the Japanese language. Hint: surely you have seen the starry emblem on all Subaru cars?  To end on a conciliatory note: I entirely agree with the last sentence of your posting [except the punctuation].  -	and you notice how he just ignores my response to his attack and continues to post off topic drivel reminiscent of penfold and chester. these people don't come here to debate issues. all they're here for is to derail debates and insult those they disagree with. and subaru doesn't even have the class to adopt a name of a good car like lexus or infinity. kind of say's it all i think. emoticonxhoho
0	Pro-choice? Why do you assume I'm pro-choice? I often play devil's advocate...I was using china as an example to show you that people when desperate, trying to get around laws (in this case the 1 child law), will abandon their children to death in the gutter -- it was unrelated to abortion laws -- it was an illustration of as aspect of human nature, which you deny.	is? I don't recall abortion being illegal in china...in fact they have the most. China is a good example of what pro-choice thinkind leads too. I asked you to provide evidence that countries with abortion being illegal will have babies thrown in streets, you just provide me with countries that have abortion legal and babies thrown in streets, maybe you should question your position.
0	Do you actually have any idea how science works? Why are you not embarrassed for creationism?	How can it get anymore embarrassing for science that they got the premise wrong for all these years?
0	just how many cases do you want to read that says exactly what i am quoting? i just gave you a taste of things to come...like the right to be left alone. even the 10 year census, all that is required by the xivth amendment i: 1. number of people who live there 2. sex of each 3. age of each that completes the enumeration and registration for the census. i will ask the 3rd time before i cover you up with cases, show me the enumerated power of any branch of government to require a person to register any right, much less firearms.	not one single thing you posted here indicates that registration would be unconstitutional.
0	Ditto squared. If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified. And I must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason, the public stance against them might not be so strong.	Of course they do.
1	Thanks, for giving me the balls. I didn't know you were trying to convert me. So, because I don't believe what you want me to I'm retarded. You know I could say the same about you, it works both ways. You see I don't want to convert you, all I'd like to see is you open your mind to other possibilities. Adios, Arrevideci	This guy is retarded. There's no point trying to explain to him why it's WRONG to believe in something completely improbable. It's the fundie wall of ignorance.These people shouldn't be allowed to breed.
1	Mr Rodgers was a pedophile and Big Bird was a flamer. ;)	But but Big Bird!!! Mr Rodgers all lies?? What about the red trolley? Damn you PBS!!!!! emoticonXMad
0	if they are used in reference to god, then how can you possibly say they don't refer to god??? jesus himself said he he and his father are one, in john 10:30. and the three appear together numerous times in parallel grammatical construction, denoting equality. it's a harder argument to make that the three are not god and that any one is lesser than the other in terms of divinity, than to say they are god.	no no no.. the concept that these three references were all 'god' came later. it isn't implicit in the bible unless you assume it is in the bible.
1	Yes but your one of those Christians people hear about, but never find. You don't really exist. :)	I don't believe it is a part of God's plan. I don't have a denomination, I simply try to follow scripture as clearly as it denotes. Most of the denominations are nitpicking anyway and it takes away from the overall.
1	I suppose if you Truly Believe its not dishonest to repeat anothers ideas as if they were your own. I will keep this in mind the next time I have to write a paper. Woe betide any professor who accuses me of plagiarism, for he is trampling my religious freedoms!	My friend, it was not dishonest, if it was I would work out my salvation with fear and trembling.
1	This rates an 8 out of 10 on the hypocracy scale. Weren't you just scolding people both for using false analogies and for citing emotionally laden imagery for political purposes? Tsk tsk.	By all means, burn those books . . . er, I mean, take down those nativity scenes.
1	and suddenly vor's list of incorrect statements has finished another lap around the universe! the area which was litterally saturated with cruise missiles was sparsely populated. the brass complained about 'hitting empty tents with multi-million dollar cruise missiles.'  suddenly you are concerned with killing innocent civilians? seriously, you have no problem when bush's policies gets a few thousand killed, but the instant clinton's massive cruise missile launch aganist terrorists kills one innocent, you're all over him. talk about massive hypocracy. you bitch about clinton not doing anything, then you bitch when his attacks on terrorism cause collateral.  seriously, get some therapy and some education.	some people would say that launching long range missiles and killing innocenet civilians was a diversion to take the heat off of monica and he in the oval office......
0	You're a little confused about that. It's all real DNA. Some of it just doesn't code for anything. But some parts of non-coding DNA (which you call "junk") has other functions besides coding for proteins.	Evolutionism on the other hand uses all of our current technology in microbiology to sort out 'real dna' from 'junk dna'.
0	But there is evidence that we do evolve. I'll give you an example. In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry.	we simply do not evolve, there is no scientific proof just ideas which change from day to day that also explain our siciety today.
1	Are you blind, or can't you read? NATO just provided evidence right now.	do they ever, just page after page of posts with no evidence
1	yep. and look at those goalposts flying across the field: so we go from showing where he ever did this to showing where he did it five times. and if five examples are provided? well, show me ten! and if ten are provided, he'll want at least half of his post count (roughly 2500). why? the point has been made, the challenge he himself laid out has been met. still waiting for the proof i'm lying archie. want to head on back to that other thread and show where i lied?	you can always tell when you've scored a hit on archie. he starts going nutso with the bold, caps, colors, and font sizes. :)
0	That's why the Second Amendment protects the private ownership of arms like the .50 BMG and other such powerful weapons.	In the vanishingly small likelihood of the event ever coming down down to it, your handgun is not going to face them down or give them a moment's pause on any measure. They would squash you like a bug, and barely notice.
1	I did not say that I thought that, that would be putting words in my mouth. Sure they'd have access to the report... Sneddon probably had his grubby hands on it ASAP. So what if the investigation was done by private investigators? If Sneddon did it, he would plant evidence... he probably did that when they searched MJ's house. Oops I mean... the government NEVER lies. emoticonXWow	You seem to think that child services only did this investigation this week. This was an investigation conducted in Feb, and the police and DA office would certainly have access to the report. The fact that they executed warrants and arrested wacko says that perhaps they have more to their case than this investigation. And also, keep in mind, that the "investigation" was done by private investigators hired by wacko, not by the police and DA's office.
1	That's deep.  Movement is not matter, I will use that the next time I decide to babble.  Are the particles no longer matter when there moving ?  Your funny.	the movement of charged particles is not matter. matter moves. the movement itself is not matter
1	Well, when the people who market prayer come up with evidence that it works as described, let us know! As a meditation technique, it might work fine, who knows, but then, so do many other methods.	We haven't been talking about marketing techniques at all...just whether prayer ever works or not.
1	it looks like you have tried to analize everything i say as being 'my' life experiences. i really enjoy your abuse , i would love to meet up with you some day. my life is fantastic actually. i dont know why i have to keep repeating that. what about those in haiti right now ? what about others? i think they are more important than your fucking sulking over the americans lousy pronunciations.or me whining over you being an arsehole. as for amy winehouse , no reputable establishment would dare touch the skank.	ps the earth is neither flat nor round lol wtf? the earth isnt round???!?!?!?!?!!?!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i was right. you suffer from fuckedintheheaditis!! inconclusive riddles??? lmaooooooooooooooooooooo retard. more like bullshit. i try and hide my racial biases?? good god. i should use you as an example of humans with shitty lives. instead of 'think of those poor africans' it should be 'think of dacey - the stupid, white trash, ho, tramp from australia' you should be an advert of the negative effects of prostitution, rape, murder, drugs and amy winehouse rolled into one.
1	Within one post.   Thanks for proving that creationist are incapable of discussing the original topic and automatically move to change the subject.	Want to bet how fast a creationist here is going to try change the subject?
1	Um no... It's the truth... Um, I guess it was sarcasm, but I don't think that would be something that you would understand.	You are speaking in some sort of code.Is it a racist code?
1	Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?	But the creationists continue to attempt to impose their religion on others as science by the latest "Intelligent Design" movement. The ID movement is nothing more than creationism that attempts to avoid a mention of God. Once ID theory (which isn't theory since it is not based on evidence and testing) is allowed into the schools, then the next step will be to introduce the fundamentalist Christian god as the designer.
1	You can believe what you want, your beliefs are not relevant to the issue.	I believe every animal was probably initally created to be vegetarians, and at some point after the Fall, any animal populations that did not consume a regular diet high in vitamin C experienced a mutation so that it could be produced internally.
0	Yes Peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. Why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us. What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. Can't you see that Peeling? None of this is provable.	Other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree, sure, but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable.
1	It is impossible to read something that can't be found.	“Maybe you should read up a little bit about what the Bible says on abortion.”
0	No nation is perfect, Rev. Not even the USA! A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail.You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK, the USA and Australia. There is injustice everywhere.	If the UK were consistant then you may have a point. But you Anti-Social, Socialist tyranny of a government ARRESTS and JAILS Tony Martin for the CRIME of SELF DEFENSE and they let the Burgular go free. Not only free but your courts deemed that Tony Martin Made the "environment hazardous to the burgular trade" Tony Martin who has NEVER been charged with a crime is serving how many years? (10 plus?) while the HOME INVADER got out in less than 1 and continued his trade.......The problem though is that YOU worry about a 12 year old with a water pistol as opposed the the CRIMINAL invading your homes...You live in a Sick Sad World my friend.
0	Ok...many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU, South America, Asia, and so on....this hypocrisy annoys me.	Im gonna have to go with Love Never Dies here. Ive read that story, and many, many people have been killed and suffered with Bush's policy in africa. Just because you never heard of it, doesnt mean it hasnt happened.
0	Incorrect.   Evolution is not something that must be adhered to. It is a scientific theory. As such, if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn't account for, then the theory would be altered or scrapped. It's really quite simple.	Like evolution, right? You have your conclusion, so everything else must adhere to it.
1	we'd have define consensus first. if it is 50% + 1 then there probably is one. then after that, who is saying they are wrong? prejudice as its finest. lesz likes to stereotype people to an extreme that can never be changed. i have never told lesz my views on global warming and lesz has shown no interest in gathering facts about what others believe.	it's not as though our vocal opponents of climatological science have exactly been enlightening. we've yet to hear why they think the scientific consensus is wrong.
0	How else should it be done? It is a constiturionally protected right. To eliminate that right, the constitutional protection must be removed first, is the removal itself, becomes unconstitutional.	So its basicly an argument against those who wants to ban weapons without changing the constitution?
0	You two are on the same side, you just don't know it yet. And you're both friends of mine so shake hands and make up willya? emoticonXHohoemoticonXGoodAnd yes's video IS very disturbing because it shows that in a time of natural catastrophe's or mass turmoil, our Government will confiscate guns from law abiding citizens. During the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict, the Gov't ordered all gun shops to lock down and to stop selling ammunition. So even law abiding citizens with legally registered weapons couldn't buy ammo to protect themselves.	This is not very helpful to you... first off, you're talking to a right winger... second, you're not debating with someone who has done this to you, though I think your claim is questionable. After all, you can't get into responses much after two days. Maybe if you showed me where they have done this, then this claim might have some validity. And now it's time for you to address my point, which you haven't done yet.
1	so you're one of the many people you got question 1 right emoticonXIdea thank you...thank you. You are the many reasons why the US is still standing on its foundations and not collapsing into senseless ignorance...THANK YOU! :)	Also, the Earth takes 365.25 days to go around the sun. Don't most people refer to a "year" as 365 days (except in leap years).
0	I believe the large majority of such deaths occur among inner city kids who don't know anything about guns except for what they see on TV and movies.	Im shuddering thinking about all the accidental deaths related to children.
1	Because of your question " What is your definition of pure", I now know how to make soap. I'll never stink again!!! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis. Ya know stuff that makes sense.	What's your definition of pure?Has it?This says different: http://skepdic.com/homeo.htmlI do know of recent studies that show that minute amounts of toxic substances are beneficial and therapeutic. I don't know if one can consider this homeopathic medicine though.I guess I don't know what's being called homeopathic medicine these days.If someone comes up with something that works can they just call it homeopathic medicine and say that homeopathic medicine works?
0	oh yeah. the things i do for fun just ruin my appetite. i like to look at bacteria under a couple of microscopes i have. sometimes i just place random bacteria together to see how they react. usually they dont do anything. if you do have questions don't be afraid to ask.	that's really interesting and that would be awesome if i could ask you questions my college course is based on biology so i could use the help xd i can see why it would put you off certain things :)

That is, unless you repent. emoticonXBanghead	28Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.32For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.Ezekiel 18
0	Obviously that is the case. We cannot simply say that a certain God exists and have it be so.	While ALL gods can not be shown to exist, it can be pretty conclusively shown that certain gods do not exist. For example, pretend there was a religion...
0	If you can't eliminate demand you could try to limit supply and control access to that supply.	Private ownership of guns may indeed add to the number of weapons held by criminals, but it is not their major source of weapons. They buy them. The market will never go away. The manufacturers will not cease making them.
1	So let's just kill them and be done with it. Is that what you're saying?	The poor can't afford it and the rich don't want it.
0	That is what it said. Now your website gives a false translation to this. It clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed.Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person (in the Christian faith) is formed before conception! This shows that God has already created you. God also talks about how you can't kill a person he created. This is an easy concept to follow.I suggest if you wish to learn what the Bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say. Religioustolerance.org is a joke that misleads people into making God what they want him to be.	And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow, he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life
1	Cannot be helped. You make it far too easy. But do not think of yourself as a loser, think of yourself as a student with significant learning deficets.	**Congrats on this very active "Support Group for Losers" you guys have put together. I'm sure all the group hugs will help lessen the terrible anxiety attacks you've been suffering lately, thanks to me. Ah, well, girls, if you can't shop, malicious snickering will have to do, won't it?
1	No I can't marry them becasue some of them are married. Also none have intent to li ve within Mass.	You do have the right to marry someone you love if you are gay or lesbian in Massachusetts, as of today. Mana'ia, you have the right to marry all of those rich people if they consent. You have the right to marry rich people of the same sex, if you live in Massachusetts. You could even marry someone just because of love who is of the same sex there.
1	An objective test? Wow! Tell me, how do you prove this test is a true useful test? Please don't tell me reason or yet another objective test.	When nature says no or maybe to your hypothesis during empirical testing, that is more than pure reason. It's an objective test independent of human reason. That's why the only one endlessly circling this corpse of an argument is you.
1	So you see a cop on the streets, you see he's armed, that's enough to induce aggression and violence, possibly cause you to hurt others, simply because you saw that somebody else was armed?	"Even the sight of guns, which people think of as objects that can hurt others, can induce aggressive ideas." -Leonard Berkowitz
0	And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a "high powered rifle" despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics.	Seven million people have applied for criminal background checks since November in an effort to buy guns, according to the FBI. That figure doesn't include Virginia, whose gun shows don't require any background checks.
1	Again, key word "genetic". My hair has the genetic characteristics of a human, but that doesn't make getting a haircut murder does it?	The fetus / baby has all the genetic characteristics of a human being from the start. Only termination of the fetus / baby will stop it from being someone's sister, brother, son or daughter.
1	Here in Michigan, they closed down the first rest area on I-75 because of the high amount of gay encounters taking place there. Maybe you should poke your head out of your closet once in a while and see what the rest of your community is up to.	No, I think I'd have much better luck asking one of yours.Ha, nice try. I sincerely doubt that. You're caught, and now just making it up as you go along. You originally said, ask any gay man and he will seem to know. I've never come across that at a rest area. Perhaps I just don't know where to look and when all of this goes on. Maybe I should again, consult you or your close friends if I want to know.
0	No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious.	The 10 commandments are a real time story, told and recorded by the person with whom it happened to... Moses.Genesis, is a history lesson, told by a man who had no understanding of modern science, or the language to describe it in that fashion... Moses.
1	ah but freedom of speech has many limitations. Since liberals are opposed to American principles their speech can be considered treasonous. No country can survive if it allows itself to be undermined. Lincoln went all out to preserve the country, we should do the same things by making liberals illegal.	There is no logic in your argument at all.For starters, what you recommend flies in the face of the first ammendment.

0	i'm surprised no one has mentioned this guy before now: http://epedia.pbworks.com/f/platypusc-2.jpeg	very true! every organism alive or dead is an intermediate between one species and another... i may be picking at straws here, but when creationists say 'show me an intermediate fossil' they want to see a fish out of water sort of business. the mudskipper is an extraordinary case because it is an intermediate to satisfy the creationists question, but its undeniably observable that its an intermedate form between fish and amphibians. ive stumped numerous creationists with this little guy.
0	actually, it can be proven whether leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, magical space monkeys and livining care baers, and even god, exists or not.the question of proving a belief seems kinda self-contradictory to me. if something is a fact that can be proven, then your belief about it is irrelevant. likewise, if you believe something, whether there are facts to support it or not, its still your belief. there are people who believe things inn the absence of supporting facts, and sometimes even in the face of opposing facts. the term for that is faithfaith is the belief of something in the absence of evidence. if you have faith in something, proof is irrelevant, or at least it should be	I cannot prove that my belief in my specific God is true any more then I can prove that leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, magical space monkeys and living care bears exists.

0	1) Charliegone's article was a published research article.I would love to know where "NARTH's" editorial was published, if it even was published.2) NARTH's article DID NOT show any "higher homosexual activity" because of legalized gay marriage.It thoroughly failed to show ANY rise in homosexuality in ANY "gay marriage" country. It showed some studies which were reportedly done in those countries, but that's it.	I also got a kick out of you saying this: I prefer to use more "neutral" sources, but I'll take a look for myself and verify everything I can. Yet, you neither offered verified links to support the one you posted, nor did your original link respond directly to SOCs issue by showing that countries which legalize gay marriage don't result in higher homosexual activity.

0	To point our an error, i believe the baby was at the infant stage, not the toddler.	mercy and killing should never be put together.there is no such thing as having so much compassion that justifies you putting a toddler to death. Dont people realize that children are gifts and not something that should be taken so lightly as to steep so low in stopping a beating heart all for the sake of selfishness and convenience for one's self.. There is absolutely no thought whatsoever in the baby, its all about "how can i live easier without this problem?".there is no such thing as compassionate killing. What it really means is "killing in the name of mercy for my comfort".people need to start realizing that the world doesnt revolve around them and that life itself is a gift TO ALL! EVEN THOSE LITTLE ONES THAT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THINK DONT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO LIVE. look in the mirror!
1	And I didn't. Did you note how I explicitly put [Jesus said] for the first two quotes from the Bible, but not for the third one? Any idea why? Come on, think ... you can do it!	hinata: Hee, hee, you're funny. Jesus was telling a parable. You can't take the tail end of a story and say that Jesus was saying to have them killed in front of Him.
1	confirming god is, at best, a one-on-one job....anyway. unless someone has personally experienced the things of god - how would one go about proving it? i know, i know...can't prove a negative....	i am sure you have convinced yourself that was what you saw. however, suprisingly (or not so), none of the 'prayer over the terminally ill' has ever been able to be confirmed. in double blind tests, there is zero effect on prayer to health and recovery.
0	I don't agree with this debate. If preventing the Devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by God then why is it that God did prevent the Devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated? They are both essentially taking the Devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good. God seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other. Why would that be?	Because Satan is a fallen angel. He had a chance to be with God, but he didn't take it. He could go back to God any time he wanted to, but he doesn't want to. He has free will. God won't take that away, even though He can.
0	Don't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in. I'm not that easily fooled.	Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again.

1	This is begging so many darn quesions it's boggling my mind!	I would venture that the acquisition of property is still a component of the pursuit of happiness but since the supply of wannabe property owners has outpaced the supply of property, I would venture that a libertarian's pursuit of happiness now involves activities pertaining his penis- providing that he can remain straight and sober long enough to make such activities worthwhile
0	i'm surprised no one has mentioned the subject of quantum mechanics in this thread. it seems to be a very good example of the concept, instead of perhaps parallel lines. the fact that things can exhibit mutually incompatible properties of either a particle or a wave depending on how we observe them is incomprehensible, yet certainly reality, no? and i think this is just one example of the apparent incomprehensibility of qm . . .	it's about looking for a point in spacetimewhere none applies. covering the entire universe, not for specific examples within the universe.

Here's a portion he purposely excised:	"Among the criticisms of Kettlewell's original predation experiments (and these were first raised by Kettlewell, himself) is that the numbers of moths he released on trees created artificially high densities, and that the moths were put onto the trunks of trees which may not be where they actually pass the day exposed to predators.

1	Do you have to have human organs to be considered a person? Who made this rule??? You? What if you get lung removed...are you less of a person? So around 8 weeks though you believe it is in fact a human?	Wrong - a 1 month old has human organs, a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks has NO human organs. That's the difference . This is a fact and the question is not whether the human organs are fully developed or not but the fact that there are no human organs at all in a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks.
1	Yes yes yes. We know you are bigoted against any non-christian. I am sure that the out of context quotes are totally misrepresenting Islam. But, your out of context quotes totally misrepresent Judaism too.. so that is no surprise.

Having offered a naive and superficial caricature of atheism, agnosticism, and theism, you then imagine a self-serving hierarchy that is, in a word, worthless - all in a silly effort to show yourself most humble. Ironic.	So we have, in order of humility:Agnosticism: Don't know, can't know. But I have my opinion. Note: Many religious people and humanists alike fit into this category. Theism: Probably can't know, but doesn't realize it. My "heart/soul/essence/whatever" tells me it is truth. Note: Often impossible to reason with. No scientifically measurable way to prove position.Atheism: Can't know, but thinks and says otherwise. Note: Usually angry. No scientifically measurable way to prove position.
1	Uncle Sam hasn't tried to pass a law saying people can't install left-handed doornobs, to supposedly protect the doornobs of right-handed people. I guess right-handed people don't feel threatened by the minority. What a concept!	To the best of my knowledge Uncle Sam hasn't passed any laws forcing people to install left-handed doorknobs.

1	that doesn't suprise me. again i'm not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people aren't equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate women. this reveals way too much about your nature. it ain't pretty. try living homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on '1million a year' emoticonxrolleyes now if the '1million a year' person gave the homeless person 1/2 million a year, then they would be equal, because equality is at the entre of such socialist ideals.	well, since we don't have to treat people equally, i see nothing wrong with making all people ages 14-16 slaves. (i doubt anyone will be against this anyway.) but moreover, since we are not equal, we can make women have pregnancies and disallow abortion. right? now obviously i think everyone is equal. personally i don't see someone that makes 1million a year any different then someone that is homeless. i guess this explains the devaluing of like though :(
1	oh hank, you really are funny. the way you are changing. i simply made a statement that it was one of many posts that you have agreed on. that was the post you disputed. are you still near all those paint-fumes? it must be the rotational affect of the egg-shaped world you live on! :) as i said... how simple is that? it is one that you've agreed on, and you now agree that it's one of several that you've agreed on. what is your point?  i made a statement that you now agree on. you raised an objection, you even say that everyone knows what you said, excepting me. how have i demonstrated i don't understand you? i haven't disputed your original statement. i made a complimentary statement.	my point is, your reply was not what i said. is that too difficult for your so called brain? lol

0	Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term. A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example. Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils.So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption.	If the flood never happened (an assumption), then it is much more likely that the dating method would be accurate to ages of tens of thousands of years as many evolutionary scientists state.

1	whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh.	this outta be good. a creationist actively making himself look like a complete idiot. normally we have to pay for kind of entertainment.  besides, even if he somehow manages to prove that ridiculous claim, that doesn't actually prove god. like i said, normally we have to pay for kind of entertainment.

0	There is a pretty huge difference.Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences.	I'm confused. What exactly is the difference between a civil union and a marriage. From what I have found, they are identical with the exception of one is religious and the other secular. Is there a larger legal difference?

1	I guess it's okay to lie for Jesus just so long as He ain't intently watching.	You must be thinking of Behe. Dembski originally planned to be part of the trial, but when he realized that he'd be required to testify under oath, he backed out. In other words, he is unwilling to promote his view when he's not allowed to lie or when he will be required to answer questions he doesn't want to answer. Interesting, eh?

And you don't balance the budget with massive tax hikes and gutting the military like the liberals are fond of doing. And you're going to vote for liberals? Obama? His latest budget plan was defeated 414-0 in the House. Not even his liberal cohorts would vote for it. And you vote for Obama? What the hell is the matter with you people?	I agree that liberalism sucks. However, you dont know what liberalism is, so have no idea which parts suck or why. You just keep telling the same lies and refusing to learn anything. People like YOU are the reason this country is failing. It is not "liberal economic policies" that are bankrupting us, it is STUPID economic policies, and you seem to support all the especially foolish ones. That is why the republican party has become the party of stupid. They hate liberals, but leave us no choice but to vote for those liberals because nitwits like you ensure that we dont have a conservative choice.Way to go.

1	And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said, "There can be no liberty without virtue." Someone else once said, "Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings".   If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - "The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur.	Libertarians are social liberals and economic conservatives. They want decreased regulations on society (legalize drugs, gay marriage, etc.)...

1	Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. The only ones who tend to ask "Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position.	The difference, and I think it is a significant difference, is that Omegamon spoke of feeling the threat of potential harm. I believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks. Nor does it require being stupidly fearless. We all take reasonable steps to reduce our risk of danger every day. To me, the use of a firearm to reduce risk does not seem all that reasonable. The intent of my opening post was to find out why Omegamon and others feel differently.

0	The other articles on her website are also well worth reading: Musings on Christianity, Homosexuality & the Bible	For obvious reasons we Christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion. We have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of Buddhists, New Agers, or even Satanists to meet, because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble. Perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the Emperor Nero used to ignite Christians as human torches to light the streets of Rome at night. The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion.But in the case of civil same-sex marriage, instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here, we oppose the idea, quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals, nature, tradition, history, and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground. All of these arguments are related, of course. They are an appeal to that part of American society in which Judeo-Christian values are still deeply rooted. For even in America at the dawning of the 21st century, many people's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the Western Christendom of our heritage, as do their ideas of tradition, history and an ideal society.We do not, however, argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion. There is desperation in our tone. There is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric, to the point where we even accuse homosexuals (without much proof, I might add) of being child molesters and sexual predators, and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their "lifestyle."There are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears, but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy. We feel deeply threatened, for we sense that we are losing the battle. Not simply the battle against homosexuals, but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as "Christian America."At one time in this country we could count on quoting a verse from Genesis or Leviticus before Congress or the Supreme Court and that would be the end of the debate. No more. The consensus of common biblical values on which we had once depended is giving way to the pluralism of a postmodern society. And seeing the disastrous handwriting on the wall, we have become politically desperate, and so we lunge at the enemies of Christendom with a ferocity that rivals that of even the most radical gay activists.

1	So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico.	MEXICO CITY – Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out, lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings, including the massacre of 17 people last week, prosecutors said Sunday.After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells, the Attorney General's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption."According to witnesses, the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards' weapons for executions," office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference.The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation. No charges have yet been filed.Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings, including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon, which is near Gomez Palacio. In that incident, gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall, killing 17 people, including women.Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene, and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison.Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon, the capital of northern Coahuila state, he said. At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15, local media reported.Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels. "Unfortunately, the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians, only to return to their cells," he said.Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers, known as the Zetas.Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes, catching criminals and convicting people. Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences. But Sunday's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes.Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation "can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address, once again, the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again."Also Sunday, Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas.Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan, 39, as a top member of La Linea gang, the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel, saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes.Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments, moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez.Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma, though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the Attorney General's Office, as Ledezma is.La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate.Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan, but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram (pound) of cocaine and two guns.His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim.Also Sunday, the Attorney General's Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns, 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house.Elsewhere in Tamaulipas, police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos. Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized.Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico's pipelines.In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero, authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations, including three in or around the resort of Acapulco. Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month.
0	The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. Personally, I disagree. When we kill children in Iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all.	That statement exposes your ludicrousy. First, you say you're against killing children who don't have a chance. Then you say the death of the Kurds and the WTC mean nothing to you. What chance did the children in the gassed Kurdish village have? What chance did the children in the WTC Day Care Center have?
0	It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.	Intelligent design is a recent concept (not associated with any one religion) and it hasn't had over 100 years to be studied. Why not start now? It can't happen if we block it from future generations. Why not give it a chance, study it, search for evidence, and offer it up for peer review? What are you afraid of? That it can mathematically rule out previous evolutionary theories?

0	There is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism. Binocular vision works. Its balanced and can render 3d positioning in the mind accurately. The lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d, as humans do due to skin that is light-sensitive to a certain extent. It isn't an eye for defending against predators, and it doesn't need one. As for insects, the fact that they've survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well. Have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately?	One reptile has a type of third eye, but it isn't for sight nor is it permanent. It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult. Then it is covered by scales. Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes? I mean, it didn't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it.Now let's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument. They too have extra eyes called ocelli, not working eyes mind you; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement. Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1% of that of humans? And we all know that humans don't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom. MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights. Insect eyes. Honeybee legs.What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which can't be reasonably or rationally answered, they refuse to even consider them. Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom, but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies. Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental, social and predatory pressures, hasn't it made more diverse selections where needed, as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads, rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today, just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected?

0	When the criminal has greater civil protections than his victim, and this is viewed as being civilized, a society is doomed.	Read these storys of self defence and then tell me Brady how you can justify theseThe injustice of the British ban on self defenseMaking matters worse, the British legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them. An example is the Tony Martin case:Tony Martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed, and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg. Later on that day, the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. At trial, Martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. The surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he “has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars.” Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.Another example, from 2009, also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims:A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home – while the criminal went free. Munir Hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve “civilised society”. But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque, Reading Crown Court heard. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. But when Hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September. Sentencing, Judge John Reddihough told them it was his “public duty” to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.This one is quite nice as wellCleared: Builder who chopped off thug's ear with Samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | Mail OnlineWell thank god for the gun ban in england.

1	oh yeah. way easier. which is why gay marriage has come such a long way since it started. ;) marriage would only be removed from any legal document. it will still appear in religious documents. the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exists.	the benefits aspect can be resolved simply by petitioning the government to stop using the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple (of age of consent) to join in a civil union. right . . . but rather than removing every reference to marriage from every state and federal law and replacing it with the words 'civil union' and then extending the right to participate in a civil union to gay people and straight people alike, wouldn't it be way easier just to, uh, let gay people get married? besides, if the idea of gay marriage is seen as an 'attack' on straight marriage, how exactly is the notion of removing 'marriage' altogether going to be construed? not as a friendly compromise, i'm betting.
0	i am amazed you think al gore is lsong the debate last time i checked he has a global scientific consensus supporting his position, you know that means that the majority of the worlds scientists. http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm	poor al. i want to feel sorry for him but i always end up laughing at him ;)
0	Bad comparisons. A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes (not just limiting it to gun homicides).	Even if the number of defensive uses is only 800,000 a year, that's still a rate of more than 53 to 1 when compared to the number of homicides committed with a firearm.Kleck was a supporter of the anti-gun position. But then he decided to go and commit the ultimate sin that a liberal could: he began to think in a logical and questioning manner. If he could learn the error of his ways, why can't you?Even if the number of defensive uses is only 100,000 that's still more than 6 to 1 when compared to the number of people murdered every year.
1	Hmmm, well then, God must be unrighteous since we "evil atheists" - and tons of other evil people - have not been eliminated. What happened to righteousness NECESSITATING the elimination of evil by killing humans??? Well???I guess that in addition to being unethical and easily manipulated, your God is also terribly inconsistent.	unkerpaulit: 2. it does not imply that god is not righteous. being righteous necessitates eliminating evil
0	You lost me there. Try them how and for what?	...and be used to try innocent people in a court of law.
1	You forgot to mention that we would have to change our numbering system so that grasshoppers had 4 legs.	If Creationism replaced science? First, we'd have to discard the fact that the Earth is billions of years old. Second, we'd have to discard the facts of the order of appearance of organisms, and switch back to the incorrect chronology listed in Genesis. Third, we'd have to reclassify bats as birds. Fourth, we'd have to scrap the fully supported fact and theory of evolution. Fifth, we'd have to go back to believing that people think with their hearts. And so on, and so on.
1	On the other hand abortion is only opposed by the born and wars are started only bu the born and choices are made etc etc etc etc.	Quote from the Great Ronald Reagan"Abortion Is Advocated Only By Persons Who Have Themselves Been Born"
0	You state "the woman comes first". This seems to be your only "absolute". Why does the woman come first? Is it because she is fully developed? Is she more important than the child she is carrying?	To me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. But those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. And the woman comes first. It's between her and her physician. It's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not.
1	My apoligies emoticonXAngel It must have been the testosterone emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead	Hint: America doesn't "win" anything by staying in Iraq killing Iraqis. Real life isn't a videogame you're trying to complete.Hint: Using multiple punctuation marks detracts, rather than adds to your argument, by making you look like a raving lunatic.Hint: Strawman arguments, such as claims your opponent wants to "appease" (appease who?) simply look like the desperate flailings of a drowning man, especially when completely without context, as yours are.Stick to your religious principles and you might do better:But being American, she knew killing Iraqi children would be the right thing to do FOR TOTAL VICTORY FOR AMERIKA!!1!!
1	Why don't you answer Bryan's post above troll? He has some important information you would never figure out by yourself?	I'm not in the least surprised.. I stated that it was required by Law.. I never said anything about when it became a requirement. As of now, in the year 2010 applying for a SS number is required.. Would you say that is an invasion of Privacy?.. and for your Information Clinton wasn't the first or last President to Rape the Social Security program.. Politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades.
0	Well, one person got it right...where in the constitution does it say something about health having to be protected?	"We've got a major problem and it's not with the legislature, it's with the courts," Cuccinelli said. "Because of these sorts of rulings . . . we get a bunch of judges that want to write their own policy into the Constitution."
0	Actually we do not know who the first human to get AIDS was. Most likely it was an African who got it from a green monkey last I looked into the matter, most likely by eating the creature. You are perhaps referring to case zero, but thats only as far back as the chain can be traced, its not the first case in humans.	Of course. Look at who spread AIDS to everyone - gays. Look at who had it first - gays (first one was from a man who did beastiality in Africa)
1	Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact.	Why would everybody participate in such a conspiracy?Reputations among scientists are made based on the accuracy of their data and the implications of their discoveries. Why has no one successfully built their career on the sound disproval of ToE?
0	I argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster. Do we have any of those on this message board? Because from what I can see, it's primarily the "religious" argument counter...	And what of people who oppose homosexual relations or legalized gay marriage, or both, but who aren't religious and therefore don't even use religion as an argument?
0	jessica, all these problems you've listed, the human body takes care of automatically and remarkably well. the fact still remains that only less than 5% of all abortions occur because the risk is great enough to be deemed life-threatening to either tha mother or the child. and that percentage is diminishing as well. the overwhelming majority of abortions occur simply because the woman decides she does not wnat to be a mother.	Pregnancy is ALWAYS physically harmful. You try carrying a load of extra weight about and see what that does to your heart. It is also always life threatening - women still die from it and you never know how childbirth is going to go.
0	For years I've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact. To date, no takers. Want to step up?	And all having a real, verifiable negative impact on society, which cannot be said about gay marriage. Can we tone down the drama a little bit?
0	wow. just because people believe in god or claim so does not mean they have or use god as their moral compass. the god, i assume we are talking about the christian god, does not promote war and if we are to actualy follow what this god teaches and use god as our moral compass we would not go to war, but most people do not follow god as their moral compass and thus do go to war.	those who don't have god as their moral compass are the ones who are responsible for 99% of crimes committed to humanity. what are you talking about? except for communists i can't think of any crimes committed by atheists. as for crimes committed by people who believe in god? pick a war...seriously, pick any war before communism came about and most wars after it and you'll see that in every case the leader of that nation and nearly the entire population of that nation believes in god. honestly you may deserve a prize for having created the most demonstrably wrong statements on this site. congrats!
0	Apparently you thought I was claiming that pro-lifers thought that the baby's life was more valuable than the mother's life. So I clarified:	I know of no one that is pro life believes the mother should die so the baby can live.
1	We accept your forfiet. Two more to go! Once they post, this thread will be pretty much closed. I predict Penfold will go first, followed by Jo. emoticonXSmilie	Welp, I'm done here. There's only so many times you can try to explain something to someone when they don't bother actually reading it. Penfold, Jo, have a blast.
1	LOL! Dodging the problem Easyrider. So, is sidestepping the best you can do?	Easyrider: No, mankind is an incompetent mother and father for butchering their own unborn.
0	Still clueless and still presenting a barrel of laffs I see. Have someone that can read and comprehend spell it out for you. I bet yer mun is considering that to get you out of the basement. How's the weight loss coming by the way?	An immaculately presented response, entirely avoiding the topic, or indeed reason, in order to unwittingly further the case for retrospective abortion.
0	Oh never mind that such a condition would be toxic...not to mention that no ice cores support such magical ideas.	It gets worse. I went to a presentation of Creation Science once and this 80 year old "archaeologist" told me that before the flood, the atmospheric pressure of the planet was double what it is now and that the oxygen content was higher.
0	economically it is great. heck, it would even be better if robots did all our jobs for us at almost no expense. sure the corporations would be fine with that because they would profit but what about the average person who cannot find a job? sending jobs over seas doesn't hurt our economy but it doesn't help billy who lost his job to it. i'm not suggesting that we stop outsourcing jobs but i am suggesting that while our jobless rate increases that our government do something to keep some jobs here.	you should have added who you would vote for if you could vote.... if i stick a point for bush in it taints the results! anyway, shutting down trade isn't the way to go. america is a consumer nation... outsourcing jobs is good for our economy, no matter if you want to say it's true or not. the more people can buy with less makes them happy, the extra profit makes the corporations happy. this animation is so true: http://www.markfiore.com/animation/toys.html yes, virginia, there is a sweatshop in china!
0	a cop tried that in school and got sued and lost, a private individual will get sued for assault, and false imprisonment at the least. there are more cases each day but one thing the justices did mention was marbury v madison. you can ignore an illegal law with impunity. we have the ruling. we also have past cases quoted in the h eller and mcdonald cases. you implied there were none and that is false. would you like to take a stab at nunn v, state of georgia for instance? star gazer cited a lower court ruling that the gun grabbers used just as sinjin used an earlier, oveturned case in people v zirillo. how can you miss so much?	there are no criminal penalties for private individuals and organizations violating the constitutional rights of other private individuals. your backpack and person may be searched without a warrant if they have reason to suspect you of having stolen something. as there are no penalties that means there is no crime having been committed. the civil rights act of 1964 is another matter of discussion entirely. unfortunately until lower court cases build precedent to show that firearms ownership is a civil right and will be treated as such there is nothing that can be done when private individuals choose to prohibit firearms on said property.
1	what a shocker. let me paraphrase: anyone: not following you aa, can you support or clarify what you're saying here? aa: nope!	nah, it isn't worth the effort if you can't make the connection. g'night my friend.
1	And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work.	Your selective memory is at work again. As I recall, in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians. Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied, at first, by the government. Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which, ironically enough, is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops. In the end, the 'open and shut case' the government thought they had, blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses. I also recall, at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York, I think it was. There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton, I believe. There are a few other instances I'm sure.
1	If it did that, then you might have won an argument by now.	Yes it does troll, as it clarifies his dishonest style of debating. But why would I expect you to get that.
0	can you think of the mental trauma of having your rapists baby? and then caring for it? for rape victims, no i still don't think abortion should be the first choice, but it should be available.	why do you feel that childern concieved through rape have a lesser right to life then childern concieved through consenual sex? if you consider abortion to be murder, just why do you support murder in specific cases.
1	It's a self-defeating question. You're asking why numbskulls participate in numbskullery.	But how can you be against a proven method of reducing abortions at the same time?
0	I'm glad you made the same correlation I did. ToE is a substitute for #### in this case.	The phrase "#### hits the fan" refers to what would happen if such an event occurred, a big mess. For example "Big Jimmy just found out Sly Jones was sleeping with his wife, the #### is really going to hit the fan now!"Substituting something else into the metaphor other than #### renders it meaningless, its unclear what would happen if a "theory" hit a fan, are you trying to say it would make a mess, that nothing would happen, that it would spin in circles?
0	So you've gone from evolution and ID to cosmology. You have a real problem with maintaining established realms. ID addresses evolutionary theory, not abiogenesis, and not cosmology.	So where did we come from? How did all of the matter in the universe propel outward? Is this one of millions of universes that never cease to start, expand, contract, end and then start again? You cannot answer every question with science. A role for philosophy exists in this world.
1	No, actually, we don't.   I suppose it's pointless to ask someone who would speak for God to not tell me what I know.	Ok, we all know that human beings were created in the image of God.
0	That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful.	I was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion. Liberals don't give a damn about individual freedom; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life. They want gov't control of healthcare because they think we're too dumb to fend for ourselves. They want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they don't trust parents to be parents. The list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless.
0	very much so i am surprised. i'm usually a totally cynical realist.	surprised that you can find the silver lining in things? ;)
1	your truth?? your truth???? does it come in singles or in a bundle? do i get some sort of discount for being agnostic, that's halfway between theist and atheist, ja? does it cost extra to buy the 'be judgmental and condescending, and you will enter heaven' version, or can i just buy the 'i have so many flaws, but when they are exposed or i'm out of hand, i'll just fall back on jesus, and that makes me perfect and whole' one? nah, i'll be satisfied with 'the truth that i know is truth, not faith. let's just skip the faith process.' that hits the spot!	you don't leave a lot of room for disagreement moose. all one must do to get pounced on by you all as a group is to say we disagree with the lifestyle and we are immediately attacked as christianistas/christers/christianists bigots. homophobic haters who want to oppress and destroy you. but none of what you accuse me of being is true which is why it rolls of me like water off a duck. and i realize my truth is hard and painful to receive but it is spoken in love and out of an eternal concern for you. if what i believe is true, and it is; and i really felt about gays as you say i do, then why would i tell you about the good news of salvation in the hope of spending eternity with you ? explain that if you can.
1	Being put in a cell with Howard Dean for life? emoticonXCry	Oh really? I had the impresion that the death penalty was the worst we had to offer. Can you inform we what is the ultimate penalty then?
0	So,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?Sure,if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion,no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume "armed citizens" would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not.	O.k., lets go through your scenario. The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed. Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated. The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms. Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up. The five rounds with 200 million guns, works. The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers, though the price is high in terms of casualties. America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place.The year is 2004, the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food. But each of the 400 million people has a gun, with lets say 30 rounds each. The population now has 12 billion rounds, and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities, and lets also assume for the hell of it, that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope (just for fun). Same situation, same invading force. The population rises up, taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches. Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles, 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun, lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere, and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know.To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes, tanks and naval units. First off, 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people, so you have a lot of venerable areas. Where ever the militia units try to form, they are killed by tanks, even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world, you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions. But, wait. Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population. Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units, lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks, and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect. To defeat the American army of planes you would, again, have to have massive numbers (or technology superior planes). So the population tries shooting down the planes, but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles. But again, wait. Somehow, without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force, all planes are spotted (miles away) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia. The genius military leaders (who no body though to kill) work no doubt. Yet still, the population is defeated because if I remember correctly, the militia doesn't have naval units. So even if all the inland forces could be killed, the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force (which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy, the greatest in the world technologically).But lets assume, the population just swims to the invading ships, kills the crews, and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships. Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance. I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then America's armies for one simple reason. The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg (I know my spelling sucks) like attack. Most of the ICBM silos aren't connected to the internet, mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack, so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone.Now, you may be wondering what am I trying to say here. Well its simple, if somehow, just somehow, the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated, it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy's capital city to make attack impossible. Again, the blitzkrieg like attack? Even if that worked the U.S., like Russia and a few other nuclear powers, keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over, and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army. So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked.But lets assume that happened (maybe during a really, REALLY cool party some idiot colonel peed on them, and they just fried). The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air, ground and sea. You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know, that's a pretty low number for the invasion of America), and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles (again lets assume somehow America's own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all America's nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event). The hugest, most glaring problem with the militia, unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop, they would have to gather. And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in, to order to defeat the large invading army, they would be taken out very easily by 1. ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2. Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence (remember those satellites) 3. all groups preparing for "battle" so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars, ambushes, rockets, infantry rushes, tank columns etc. before they knew what hit them.4. It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight, and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability, they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y., N.Y., and....wait America's satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that, it wouldn't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit (effectively sitting ducks). And any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection. --------------------------------------------------------------------------But militia units only have guns, and they would get their butts whooped, even with massive numbers. What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics, in today's modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint, the terrain was different, the people are more hardened, the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians, the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves, had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide, plan and attack, only had to defeat, on the majority, other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross, the Russians were under funded and their moral low, the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire, china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence, Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces, the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S., it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America, and, finally, the afgans didn't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands, but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan, the americans would be defended their homeland. Neither is the French revolution a good-counter point, as I have said, your tactics only work with Napoleonic-style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when Napoleon the 3rd was in power? (in case you didn't learn it in school, Napoleon the 3rd, napoleon's nephew, was in power during the french revolution) Trust me, cause the only thing I love more then physics is military tactics and warfare. ----As I have shown in more detail, Treat2 is right, it wouldn't work.------The other amendments don't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the U.S.A, they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and "In Fashion" so long as the U.S. still has human citizens. Please opinions only, not baseless assumptions using limited military knowledge, or rebuttals to previous opinions.
1	OK, where do we start? The NAACP. Affirmative Action? UNCF? Miss Black America? emoticonXRolleyes	Racial problems exsist enearly everywhere, it's a problem that has gotten better but it hasn't gone away. Muslims/Africans/Scots/English/American etc we are all the same human beings but with different beliefs and racism is a disgusting thing and needs to be abolished!
1	Can cause aggression, does not mean that it will though. Alcohol has a far greater record of this but yall are not trying to ban that. So do women but we arent going to ban them now are we, Sorry but I was in a marriage from hell and just had to throw that in.	Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it. It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
0	We share a border with Mexico. The drug cartel is armed with missile and grenade launchers. But when was the last time 72 of our police officers were murdered on American soil, in a single day, at a single location?   The countries with the greatest number of legal gun ownership, they're absent these mass killings that take place on a regular basis. There's no rebels in America killing entire cities worth of people without opposition; not even in the small towns that're without a local police force.   Explain that one away.	the mumbai massacre was an attack by pakistani terrorists. if a country can't keep terrorists armed with machine guns and bombs from crossing its borders then you can't expect gun control to help in such situations. there might be even more such attacks in the us if the us shared a border with pakistan.
0	That's obviously not what is said. The sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.	Evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamics—the entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increase—poses no barrier to evolution. Their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature, uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available. Specifically the sun's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people. All that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy, especially the sun's energy. If complicated living organisms can be created in this way, certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced. Especially a solar-powered house!
0	It's not about how she treated cops. It's about how cops treated her as an American citizen with rights.	she believes she can treat cops like she did and doesn't really care what reaction they have because she will use it as an excuse to sue them.
0	This is more of a legal question involving whether or not it was negligence(sp). If so, you can't really sue for amounts of money you MIGHT get in the future. He could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedures. So ya know :). I don't really know what the question is.	I won't throw my ideas on abortion out there just yet, but I have to ask this question. Should fathers have to pay child support considering a mother could have mitigated the expense by having an abortion?For example: Jack is 55 and makes 20,000 a year. Jack gets injured by Bob, and can no longer work unless he gets a $1000 operation. Jack's religion or other views preclude getting the operation, so he sues Bob for $200,000, the wages he'll lose over the next ten years. Since Jack could mitigate his losses by having the operation, nost likely all he will be entitled to is $1000.So- shouldn't child support be limited to the cost of an abortion, under our current pro-abortion laws?
1	Since you're so fond of reporting personal attacks to the mod, maybe someone should return the favor to you? emoticonXRolleyes	I called you a misogynist, dipemoticonXCensored. Read the dang post emoticonXBanghead . I said your misogyny and your bigotry run hand in hand with your brand of Christianity (your bigotry due to how you treat gays).It was in reply to this lovely statement from you: when I stated that I was a woman. Get a reading comprehension, AA. Do you know what misogyny means? Maybe that's your problem.As to me defending gays, I am friends with several, and basically feel disgusted at the way they are treated by people like you and the way they are denied the same rights of marriage that I just obtained with my husband.
1	Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....	We've got approximately 30,000 gun laws in this country as it is. Most of them that would put dangerous individuals away for a long time are never used. So we're not in the mood to discuss future restrictions that won't be used either.
0	I'll address the later question. They may not "need" teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't "useful", they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case.	http://www.imagequest3d.com/cgi-bin/...c&tt=&bool=andHow did the anglerfishes evolve their rods and lures?...and why do they need such big teeth?

Oddly enough it took 20 pages before one of them even tried to argue against the reasons why the flood did not occur.	humphreys is full of ####. how about you check out dalrymple's book? 100% of the scientific evidence kicks humphreys's xxx. a.k.a. 'the winding up problem.' completely fabricated, based on a complete misunderstanding of galactic motion. many don't. but they're replenished from the oort cloud regularly. science also explains this thing called plate tectonics. that humphreys 'overlooks' this should make you smell the rat. so he 'overlooks' plate tectonics twice? he's either ignorant or a liar. some might say both. knowing his other work as i do, i say both. first, it's a faulty assumption. second, the ion content of the oceans isn't changing. third, if this method worked, and we used aluminum, we could 'prove' that the earth can't be more than 300 years old. oops. talkorigins takes care of this one just fine. i'm just wondering what kind of trees grow to 2500 feet tall. never trust anybody too ignorant of plate tectonics to understand subduction to tell you about geology. ... were addressed above. you have so few arguments that you're repeating yourself, mainly because you don't even read the tripe that you post. humphreys blew the calculations big time. he's been refuted left and right. do a search on his bogus r.a.t.e. group and find out for yourself. because humphreys went out looking? how many should we allegedly find? but there's no evidence here for creation. all you can do is argue (extremely poorly) against an old earth. three strikes and your out, kid. hit the showers.
1	The penis is not designed for the hand?so you want this entire board to believe you don't wank off! Oh come on.....get real...everybody does it...who are you kidding....You lost all crediblity right there!	You want to talk about logic, try this: The penis is designed to enter the vagina, it is not designed for the mouth, hand, anus, or any where else you care to mention, think about it, it is logical. You don't have to be religious to see that homosexuality is wrong, it is against nature. FACT!

1	are you illiterate or just stupid? when you try to use biblical passages dishonestly and out of context in order to convince people that god would favor an economy without social programs when, in fact, the exact opposite is clearly true, then you have perverted the word of god in the service of selfishness and greed. this aint hard.	you mean he didn't deny christ (who is jehovah god, jewish messiah, and resurrected savior of mankind)? and if i sinned, then why aren't you all over daewoo for doing the same thing? didn't he say in a previous post: 'you have perverted the word of god in the service of selfishness and greed.'? when my service was to the poor and needy? why the double standard, steeeve? and when are you going to wise up and quit denying jesus christ?
0	There's a distinct difference... so what? No baby at any age can live outside the womb. It still needs care and attention like any other. This difference in age doesn't mean anything.	But viability outside another human being is a clearly distinct difference between a zygote and a new-born baby.
0	So they had guns that could shoot down planes even before they had planes?   Their primitive muskets were that powerful? I am not that easy to fool!	.50 caliber rifles have been legal for ownership since the revolutionary days. they even had .75 caliber rifles. so why can't we have .50 caliber rifles today? i've yet to see any proof at all that a plane could be hit, let alone actually be blown out of the sky, with a single shot from the .50 bmg.
0	The purpose of the Bill of Rights.  Preamble to the Bill of Rights	The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. Rights Retained by the PeopleAside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.
1	EasyRider just doesn't like gay men trying to shove it down his throat! emoticonXAngel	Actually that's not what he said, but if we are going to bring it to gay relationships I've yet to see homosexuals campaign against heterosexual relations. I have the other way round.
0	So any long publication must be due to a panic attack? It takes a few minutes to read those posts, but it takes an hour and a half to watch Expelled; does that mean that IDers are having the mother of all panic attacks?Your logic can't even be described as "tortured," marc, because it's completely nonexistent.	Yes, panic attacks are sparking many very long winded rants.
1	but the question is can you prove your belief system is true? and all you've done is spew hate for religion but haven't even tried to actually answer the question. and ask yourself this. if the idea of god is such a man made plague, then god doesn't even exist right ? so if god doesn't exist then what has he done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer.	'what i find most interesting' is to consider a humanity purged of the chronic scourge of rabid religion. how much more pleasant, and saner would the world be. and how many indigenous peoples around the planet would have continued to survive and thrive unmolested by what i consider the evilest of all manmade plagues, religion.
1	But you still feel they have the right idea when it comes to firearms?	Since they are issued by the military I would think so.
1	Ever hear of artificial ensemination? Why is that heteros only think there is one way to produce children? I find hetero sex disturbing,and an unnatural lifestyle choice.	You say that homosexual relationships should be all that there should be because hetero sex is wrong. Using your logic there would be no more children because nobody would be straight. After everyone died humans would no longer exist because there would be no offspring. Very intelligent I must say. Great way to preserve the human race. emoticonXBanghead  This is how I feel everytime I hear a dumb statement like that.
0	All born children, and every woman had the right to be rid of them. Killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb (during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur, at least). They are not comparable.	Susan Smith shocked the nation with the murder of her children. She believed her two young boys were an obstacle to remarriage, so she placed them in her car, fastened their seat belts, and drove them into the lake. Smith's crime was especially obscene because she violated the most fundamental moral obligation of all: the responsibility a mother has for her own children. Yet wouldn't Susan Smith be exonerated by Thompson's and McDonagh's logic? These children were kidnappers and interlopers, trespassing on Smith's life, depriving her of liberty. Why not kill them? Those boys were attacking her. It was self-defense. Last year, a couple in New York was arrested when authorities learned they took a 10-day vacation to Florida and left their young children behind to fend for themselves. If McDonagh's and Thompson's arguments work, these parents should be released from jail because they bear no more obligation towards their own children than they do to strangers across town or burglars who break into their house. Those children were invading their privacy, trespassing in their home, stealing their food.
1	You mean like Korea? Oh wait we are still there....  Is Israel a nice secure place safe from terrorism? The notion that Iraq will be without conflict will not occur in our life time.	i agree. i don't agree with us being in iraq but now that we shattered their security, we have to fix it again. we can't leave without cleaning everything up. that's like saving an animal in the woods from a predator and then just setting it free in the middle of new york city. we have to return it to a state where it can function on its own.

1	a double helping of insulting spam? i'm honoured....emoticonxgood how interesting that you selectively belittle crick's comments on panspermia while lauding his debunked tornado in a junkyard conjecture.	evolution may attempt to explain how life developed here, but it proves nothing which is why this debate is persistent and never-ending. and exogenesis is the evolutionists fall back explanation for that which they can't prove or justify otherwise, but leave it to the liars that your side is to attempt to attribute to us what you yourself is claiming. beside the fictional links, everything else is from pro-evolution sources and explanations for this other theory for how life appeared on earth. even dawkins has referred to it as a rational consideration for how original life appeared so many alleged billions of years ago on earth. read this link: the physics of the universe - the beginnings of life - exogenesis then read my posted info below and see if it isn't spot on based on what is being claimed in the link above. i rest my case.
1	hunter, would you be interested in actually discussing this logically? or do you simply wish to toss out empty assertions and run away when challenged? if your view is the truth, then you have no reason to run.	I reckon that evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason. It is untrue and cannot be proven. Darwin himself said that his theory would be proven or disproven based on the future discovery of transitional fossils. There have been NO such fossils ever found.That being the case, even Darwin agrees that the theory of evolution is just man's folly. Ya'll can write millions of words about evolution, but what you lack is the proof of one discovery of transitional fossils The fact of the matter is that God created man in his own image. Case closed.

0	And Stephen Hawking, the only thing he has said was "I do not believe in a personal god", which would make him a pantheist or deist at best.	I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being.
0	Oh deary me, no. Where do I even start?The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :)	And regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria, are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon? The bacteria works on a microscopic level and couldn't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on. So your example is both fallacious and moot.
1	I see. So you actually reject all of science and still are willing to use a computer and the Internet. Don't you know that you are being led astray by your IBM processor?	Science has lead us astray for decades, and now it's coming back to bite them.

1	Winning any political election has never been about electing the "best" man for the office, it simply means you appeal to the majority of people that showed up to vote. Smartest and most popular aren't necessarily the same person, if you went to school you probably remember that. ;)	It's not surprising that 21 million people would vote for Moore's feces. More than that voted for John French Kerry. In yellow dog politics, you vote for whatever the party puts up. It's been a political fiasco and the liberals are p i s s e d.To put any credence in the election, I'd have to know how it was run. Who was allowed to vote? [I didn't get a ballot.] Could people vote more than once? Did only the "liberal" city-folk and Hollywood incest droppings get to vote?If you believe that Moore's film is the best because it got the most votes, then you must believe that Bush is the best, because he did, too. Thank you.
1	So the "Origin of Species" has more information for theistic evolutionists than the Bible does?? Does theistic evolution believe in Satan?	As I said, you don't have a clue. You are SO wrong.

1	Oh, I think they ought to creat this superstate and we Americans will REALLY have a big laugh. Go for it. I need the levity.	Right....Anyway, its not surprising Americans don't read the EU constitution: I don't know any Europeans who've read the US constitution.I agree with Jo and Nurglitch, its not all that funny (although i quite like the 'veritable smorgasbord of asisininities). It seems to be 'politics first, comedy after', something comedians of all persuasions are vulnerable too: what you would call 'liberal' comedians here in Britain were often so angry about Iraq that their sketches devolved into rants.Incidentally, what does the US have against the EU constitution? Is it fear of a superstate with greater economic clout, or just 'those darnded Europeans, with their welfare'?

0	hold on there. have you read the amendment? if all of our legistlators passed laws based on single incidents, our nanny government would be exponentially more intrusive than it already is.  now i don't know this woman's story any more than you do. all you know is that at least one defense contractor has a clause in it's employee contract banning an employee from shoooting for the brass ring in a jury trial. it doesn't state that the rapists can't be prosecuted.	rape is rape and gang rape is gang rape and i don't need to read any stinkin' bills of attainder to determine that. but then, women are nothing but disease in your eyes.
1	Evidence, I dont need no sticking evidence. This is what I beleive, and thats it, but I will dig up some proof that supports my point.	This is pure paranoia. What evidence do you have to support you're point of view? Why don't you actually do a little research yourself. Handgun Control Inc was founded by two victims of gun-violence. Sarah Brady joined Handgun Control Inc after her husband received brain damage from a bullet. Senator Ted Kennedy also supports gun-control because some of his family members were killed with guns. Many people who support gun control have experienced the horrors of gun violence firsthand and are just trying to make our nation a safer place. It's not because they are power hungry.

0	You forgot to fully quote John 8:18. here is the rest: and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me. He isn't bearing witness to Himself here. Two witnesses are, one of which is Himself, which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing.	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.- John 5:31I am one that bear witness of myself...- John 8:18[Jesus was the speaker in both of these quotes]

Toxic gases, giant ash clouds, thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there's anything approaching an eruption, it's not a pretty picture. Molten rock isn't the most environmentally friendly substance you'll ever encounter.

She was quickly transferred to the trauma centre, where I worked to take the baby thru Caersarian Section. I worked with 4 other M.D.'s trying to save both lives, and our work was valiant, to say the least. Sadly, we lost both the mother, and the child, no matter the heroics we used.

0	You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.As I said, I may just be being nit-picky.

1	Thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms, neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions. Now as I gaze at the night sky with all its' bits and pieces spinning around each other I can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall.	Is this the sort of thing that is being taught at that bastion of liberal science, MIT? How can this be presented as fact rather than theory?New and improved nuclear fuel createdNuclear fission, neutrons and protons, and even the atom itself are just theories. No one has ever seen an atom or a neutron. No one has ever observed an atom split. Why are our liberal news media allowed to present this as fact?Moreover, aren't nuclear reactors designed by intelligent humans? I also notice that this research was funded by our hard earned tax dollars without requiring that the benevolence of God also be researched in equal time. This is yet another shameful example of the godless attitude of science.
1	so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? same with developmental biology? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community? the reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else. tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?	oh, and btw, cooperative mechanisms of evolution are perfectly compatible with darwinian mechanisms. it's still a matter of determining which genomes survive into the next generation, and if genes that have 'learned' how to cooperate are better survivors than those that compete too aggressively, then darwinian theory predicts they should increase their frequency in the population. biologists have used game theory extensively to model how balances between cooperation and competition can be maintained in a genetic population. but what we get from this sort of perspective is not a refutation of darwinian thinking, but a more complete perspective.

1	Crammed with them, sure, why not? It's easy, only a few million light years. The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too.	The reason we make maps of the universe on the scale of billions of light years is that the scientific method has led us to that tentative but evidentially robust conclusion. I mean, look at this. A section of the sky the width of a dime 75 feet away, crammed with galaxies. And there's nothing special about that dime's worth of sky, either.

1	emoticonXFrazzledTalk about a fast and loose accusation.WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY SAY???Cause Harry Hay is well known for his gay rights work.If Jennings did find something about the guy inspiring, it was probably his gay rights work.If I said that I thought Martin Luther King Jr was inspiring, would you automatically associate my praise with extramarital affairs?This is just stupid!	... and Jennings is on record saying he found the guy inspiring.
0	I don't see how this is not a debate about abortion. True, it's become mildly less concrete, but that's what happens when you try to get it right.	As I said in my posting #39 by splitting hairs again and again you paralyse the debate. As instead of being a debate about abortion it has become a semantic nightmare.
0	Indeed. And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists aren't allowed to disagree with "standard" theory a laugh. Clearly, evolutionary biologists disagree and those disagreements are published openly. Science makes progress by questioning and disagreement.	In all fairness, the objections did come from a well respected peer review journal, even though it may have been misconstrued or misinterpreted.
0	So it's the blog's fault that Miller sided with the creationists. Right-o, marc. (I suspect you haven't even read the blog entry in question; I'd be surprised if you've read more than a paragraph of PZ's blog.. ever.)	That one blog is a very lopsided comparison to the many examples of Miller siding with them in this book.
0	Just out of curiosity, what do you feel you could sue the company for? Descrimination? Could I sue Wal Mart or Dillons for not carrying a line of adult movies and sex toys? After all, I have a right to own adult movies and sex toys. Doesn't that mean that Wal Mart automatically has the responsibillity to provide those goods? After all, they are the biggest retailer in my area.	If the pharmacist is an employee then it's a company issue as Big Orn said although you could sue the company. If no other pharmacy is available and the pharmacist owns the pharmacy I'd say sue him/her and buy online. Those Canadians will sell you anything.
0	pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. it sounds like what you're saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender, is sexist. if not, please clarify.  pro choice does give you a choice. you can either continue the pregnancy, or seek an abortion.  the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy (barring rape, etc).  if you're joking, then ignore this.	pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. sugar coating it doesn't change the fact that the sexist term, 'pro-choice' should be abolished and it should be replaced with what it really is, 'pro-abortion.' ;)
0	oh really? this isnt cyber bullying. this is barely slander. you arent returning fire. this is stupid. freedom of speech isnt a two way street. you have restrictions. both legal and moral. what the hell is going on?	wrong. slander and cyber bullying are a very big deal. i refuse to be slandered by a bigot and just do nothing. i have the right to return fire. freedom of speech is two way street.
0	No, but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition.	Do you believe it is wrong to torture toddlers for fun?
1	I just linked you to it. (You do understand how amendments work, yes?) Note the "to lay."	The 16th gives them the right to collect the tax, ONLY. their Constitutionally chartered powers consist of those specified in Article 1; Section 8. Now, you tell me where they were given the power to create a Federal Welfare state.
1	Observations? Like the posts I have made? Which would be documented via quotes?....emoticonXConfused You demanded 'links' for your recurring rudeness, I produced them. I demand 'links' for my creationism.	I am stating an Opinion based on my observation and the things I have read coming out of YOUR keyboard. If I see a black kettle I call it a black kettle...
0	good u not lied in 1 yr ....good progress.....but till what time.....? life can show any moment at any time......no one knows about it....not lieing is good but sometimes your truth can kill or hurt someone dear.....	because people: can't admit their faults, can't tell others theirs, want to look good to their peers; and because people are selfish...i really find it pathetic...this is why i stopped lying when i was young, because i saw how much everyone else did it, and just saw it as pathetic, and didn't want to be like everyone else...i haven't lied in 1 year.
1	I guess you never thought that many Cathoilics have gays in their family, or should they ask them to take their lives ?	But nobody is forcing you to support anti-Catholic policies. Of course, you have the right to support them, but don't try to make it sound as if you aren't making a conscious choice to do so. That's hypocritical.When my religious beliefs bump into the law, I've never had a gun held to my head by someone saying "support the law or else".
1	Your problem is that you take the Bible as the Literal Word of the Invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is NOT. There are other "Sins' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as I that Jesus did not change the Laws. If you want others to live by your False book of fairy tales it would be a Good Idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first. Choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish.	It's a sin, Matthew. And homosexual relations are unnatural, according to scripture. Are there other Scriptures in the New Testament which deal with homosexuality?Yes. Romans 1:24-27; I Timothy 1:10 and Jude 7. If one takes these Scriptures seriously, homosexuality will be recognized as an evil. The Romans passage is unmistakably clear. Paul attributes the moral depravity of men and women to their rejection of "the truth of God" (1:25). They refused "to retain God in their knowledge" (1:28), thereby dethroning God and deifying themselves. The Old Testament had clearly condemned homosexuality but in Paul's day there were those persons who rejected its teaching. Because of their rejection of God's commands He punished their sin by delivering them over to it.
0	You are a known anti-gun supporter, should we really be surprised at your presidential choice. Funny thing is, you are going to get screwed just like the rest of us if Obama wins. He might try to take our guns away, but your rights that are important to you wont be very far behind.	If only McCain were anywhere near his equal, it might be a contest.
0	No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here.	i am trying to show that in fact the crime rate is increasing, not that there is more than a change in how it is reported. around here (my home county) we are doing much better.
1	So who do you hold responsible for forcing people to stay at the convention center to die? Lemme guess.Should they be held criminally negligent? I'm sure the "bipartisan" commission will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable.	Uhhh, in case you haven't noticed, the workers in the nursing home have been charged with several count of criminally negligent homicide. Also President Bush has taken responsibility from the federal end. We have yet to hear from Blanco or Nagen. They dropped the ball far worse than the feds did.
0	Honest question Arch: where is the problem with a potential variance of 10 billion years? I know this question may appear ridiculous to you but could you take the question in the spirit it was meant?	So, you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory? And is actually supported by the evidence? If they have any evidence, why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility.
0	Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.The whole concept of "reap what you sow" is a CHRISTIAN concept.And now you're claiming it's flawed?While I feel the need to continually reiterate that what this guy did in harming others was WRONG (primarily to avoid the trolls from misrepresenting my point), the validity of the generic concept of "reap what you sow" is amazingly poignant.People typically don't just go nuts and harm people for no reason.Columbine saw the kids trying to harm other kids who harassed them.While some people may be jumping the gun in trying to assign "sowing", I am also amazed that others are so unwilling to inspect the question of whether or not the church involved truly did "sow"...	Would you agree that the logic is flawed in both cases? Whether you say "You go against God you reap what you so" or "you preach hate you reap what you sow" (in short)?
0	You know 'my kind'? How very presumptuous on your part. Then you know individual choice is the issue, not enforced medical procedures. You didn't answer the question regarding pregnant women who intend to carry to term being required to have a sonogram.	So is it safe to say you may be for pro-ignorance? With technology ANSWERS become clear.Everything cost money. Education cost money, therefore knowledge has a price tag. Do you now suggest people don't go to College because it too is yet another EXPENSE. Society should NOT be inventing equipment that advance our intelligence. Sonograms are great tool for understanding more to those women who have doubt. I don't know about you, but I'm all for empowerment with knowledge. Most people are "VISUAL" people and perhaps seeing the unborn may make the CHOICE clearer for the woman. I'm for educating those from ALL PERSPECTIVES. Most people would rather see physcial evidence that a sonogram may provide than the RHETORIC of SLOGANS and IDEALISTIC POINTS OF VIEW.I know your kind..."just trust me" is your motto.
0	It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have.	But that simply isn't the case. Science class is for science, and any school receiving government funding should use it to promote real science, which is thinking. Until Intelligent Design can come up with evidence, as well as any potential advantage to the science community to ID, it will be nothing but a religious belief. And religion doesn't belong in the science class any more than politics does. A completely different subject which has it's merit, but not as real science.
1	i will ask you yet again who these nefarious 'gay lobbist' are that you continually refer to? how do you define 'lobbist'. merriam-webster on line dictionary http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=lobbyists are you not yourself a 'lobbyist'? many times one thinks of a lobbyist as one who is paid to present a particular point of view. with that in mind: 1) are you receiving wages during the time you spend reading and posting on this forum? i am not. 2) is the person or organization paying you those wages aware of the nature your activities here in this forum? 3) does the person or organization paying you those wages advocate the nature of your opinions and activities expressed here in this forum? 3) are you using equipment or facilities provided by some other person or organization to read and make postings here?	i did comment by saying that it's all the more reason to make civil unions legal nationwide, with couples' benefits.  regarding your frustration with analogies, analogy is a common tool in discussion and debate. if you don't like analogies, i will be sure and point that out the next time a gay lobbyist here uses one, such as comparing gay marriage to interracial marriage (such as when invoking the loving case).

1	This will kill innovation. do you know how many years a start up business might be in the red before it generates a profit? Why bother when you know you are going to be clubbed as soon as you realize a profit? Yep, way to incentivize business there...	If profits exceed 60% of your sales. There are laws against profiteering and any company that is making more then 60% profit is profiteering.

0	(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?	for faith has no merit where reason has proof from experience.
0	i don't :( tell me, inbox me if you don't want to say it in front of other's.  i am surprised i thought you would be to holy to have lust.	i think everyone knows who i have a crush on.
0	i am surprised at your response since i see your posts as well considered and stated. i asked the question and you answered. to me it was clearly, by definition, inflammatory. we can agree to disagree and let readers make their own determination.	nope.  the first part is factual. only those who want to see saddam as a martyr will do so.  the last part are currently 3 types who seem to be calling him one. the only one's who've called him a martyr in the hours of media on this subject i've covered have been small bands of his former followers, a daughter in jordan iirc in a protest...and liberals and the media who repeat such claims.
1	And irrational emotional appeals seldom hold up in the face of logic	Averages tend not to mean much when 14 kids are laying dead in a school.
1	Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that "...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed." Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts.	EVOLUTION A FACT? Why are we told that Darwin's theory of evolution is a scientific fact -- even though many of its claims are based on misrepresentations of the facts?
1	Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means? Also that's what jeans were called before the word "jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?) So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies? Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment.	Yes through what is described as the heterosexual lifestyle.  Besides you are very much an exception to the rule. P.S. Only homosexuals wear dungarees, and I'm Heterosexual.
0	I don;t really know anything about british gun control in colonial india, and don't really see it's relevance, since colonial india is gone. I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army. This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule. The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).	" 'Arms' in this context were military arms not the personal weapons of private individuals. The context of 'depriving of the whole nation of arms' was the refusal of the British to conscript Indians into the British Army during the First World War. Gandhi was an extreme anti-militarist. The statement is odd coming out of him, but he used the circumstance for political purposes to advance the cause of Home Rule and Independence."http://www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html#gandhi
0	would you consider yourself philosophical? no, i don't think philosophy is useful. everything they claim that cannot be supported by science is simple word games, like the ontological argument. lolzor is the first person i have discussed philosophy with ever, and i'm not impressed with philosophy's lack of demonstrative capabilities.	definitely. it never occurred to me, me a person who wonders why god doesn't just stop rape, that because he can't exist in all worlds that he's not omnipotent. i like seeing your arguments. would you consider yourself philosophical?
1	Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making.	So the main disagreements between fundamentalists and theistic evolutionists are what are, and are not first (primary) causes.
1	Yes, we shouldn't let those slaves be citizens, they will burden our legal system since they will now have...OMG...rights!	4. It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody, property, inheritance, etc.,
1	Sounds like an abortion bill amendment to restrict all travel by minors is needed by those demanding that young girls give birth after being impregnated by rapists, fathers, uncles, etc. Might as well include adults, just to simplify matters and enhance state police power. Bubbah will be pleased.	My thoughts exactly. Can minors buy plane, train, bus tickets?
0	The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true.	This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.
1	Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions? Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?	Can you guarantee that what appears to be a simple mugging will come to an immediate halt once the mugger is complied with, and that he won't push for more than mere material goods?
1	When's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime? And don't you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone?	Do you have a fire extinguisher in your house? I have never had a fire in my kitchen but I still keep a fire extinguisher in there. I look at wearing firearms for self defense the same way I look at wearing a seat belt. I wear it and pray I'll never need it, but I'll be damn glad I'm wearing it if I do need it.
1	Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing as you make unfounded claims without supporting them with even the slightest proof.

Wouldn't put it past them to Photoshop those pictures just for 'shock' value emoticonXRolleyes
0	Welcome back PeterV. We now have self defense laws from 3 different states posted in this thread. Is there one you approve of more than the others, or perhaps you have a different view altogether you would like to share with us? Please feel free to enter the discussion.	Yes, it's certainly interesting to see gun advocates embracing more "progressive" notions about justifiable homicide (such as Texas' laws) while gun control advocates are clinging to more traditional ideas about acceptable self defense.
1	If you need a decision made for you, ask me. I'll be glad to. Be prepared to raise your child though.	Yeah, they want the government to do that for them. Eases the conscience if you just vote for someone to make life's tough decisions for you.
0	But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with "philosophical pronouncements" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond "atheistic philosophical pronouncements."	... here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters".
1	Like the crusades and the inquisition? How about the Southern Baptist Convention, formed at the end of the Civil War with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks? And of course, the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you. Of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't. But when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so I just never turn my back on them. That way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, I will at least have my eye on my money.	For those who are in Christ the tendancy is to be pulled towards good decisions.
0	well...., i hope you're kidding because i don't think that's a fair assessment.	i know what your point of view for everything is. whatever offends the greatest number of people.
0	alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?	um, in the debate description it talks about how marx predicted that laissez faire capitalism would lead to an the nation being ruled by an elite few, which would cause the working majority to revolt. i merely showed how socialism with private property is fascism and capitalism with regulations is fascism. am i saying it's bad? no, that's for you decide. if you like fascism, good for you.
0	i do agree. the rot started here when thatcher came to power, and became chronic when neil kinnock became leader of the labour party. now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. the actions of the ecb in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. i think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. :p george monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book age of consent. i'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though.	if it's any comfort, the same exact reality exists in europe regarding the corporate takeover there. this isn't an american dilemma only, but a global one. if you agree on that level then we do agree for once.
0	http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-chr053006.php but what does this have to do with the topic at hand?	no you didn't, here's what you posted - what am i to infer or understand based on the underlined? it says 'ice lay beneath the surface'???????? what surface? the surface now? the surface 65 million years ago? are you still trying to assert that the ice from 65 million years ago should somehow be present today? how am i supposed to get 'surface as below the surface ice that is 2000-4000 years old' from that? type what you mean clearly arch, we can't interpret your convoluted thinking. are you asking about the land under the ice which they are now coring? google 'arctic geology' 'antarctic geology' or 'greenland geology' for the answers to that. what does this have to do with anything?  i'm completely lost. maybe it's me. waxy

1	But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is. What it isn't is an explosion. I don't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang, have you?	society which accepts the idea that the origin of the cosmos could be explained in terms of an explosion, reveals more about the society itself than about the universe.

What you are talking about is not related to the subject of deterrence.	--------------------------------------------------------------------------  I do not believe that the supreme court adressed the the problem of convicted fellons having the death penelty reduced to life in prison and going on to kill in prison.
0	What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth? Have you no regard for them?	This thread has established the cold disregard for undeserved pain and death inflicted upon what would be a child created by the irresponsible acts of humans. In the name of caring for the rights of humans. Which exposes the argument of "in the name of someone's rights" a sham. As rights of only one of two are being considered.
1	I see you missed the entire point of my post. Good job on analyzing the sarcastic opening though.	Obvious strawman argument.

So the quote does not contradict the Constitution.

1	Yes, it's been supressed. Only 14 people knew it before some brave soul tortured them until they confessed the horrible truth!!	it has been known for a long time -- it's just been surpressed because it contradicts genetic determinism and neo-darwinsm in general.
1	Oh, ok, I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better. How about I refer to them as "intelligence deficient". And I was really not referring to bona fide "retarded" individuals (those with true pathology). I agree that there is nothing funny about that. How about I refer to them as people who drive like XXXXXX...Is that better?	In reality, those who are “retarded” can do nothing “normal”, including drive, eat, use the restroom, etc., without assistance. To call someone “retarded”, that's not, is common, but shows lack of character.You evidently have no loved ones that are mentally disabled. It's a low XXXX, IMO.I know there's an explanation for everything, that's why God isn't praised as much as He should be.I tend to thank Him for all things. It's a habit of mine. I just thought that I'd throw in my 2 cents worth. No harm intended.
0	If Obama had his way, standing against the government would be the most patriotic thing someone could do.	Felony arrest, severe mental illness or disturbance (like the kind that gets you off of felony murder charges because you were found not competent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect), drug addiction, or treasonous action against the country (not the current government, but the country itself).
0	you're joking right? that's not even close. here's the verse just in case you read something else, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt with that: 1 corinthians 13:3: if i give away all i have, and if i deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, i gain nothing. this does not mean 'but not loved for it', but showing love.	actually if it had said '...but have not loved', it would mean that. but it doesn't say that, it says if i am charitable but not loved for it, then helping others is pointless.
0	i agree, it is we that it is ridicules that we have gotten so into controlling stuff that now we even have a way to control natural courses, but i guess like i said before if it is to stop your child from suffering a sickness then i guess that is okay (still bad) but better than just being a complete control freak, or being selfish	then we're seriously taking over life in a ridiculous way. let nature take its course. i don't have an argument of why this shouldn't happen. i think its interesting to learn about how you do and stuff, but if people can go around and choose their children's gender, the world is seriously screwed up.
1	I think that is true of so many things. Wanna screw something up royal? -- add humans.  I heard once that a gallon (or maybe is was a barrel) of Coca Cola (syrup) is more expensive than the same amount of oil. Things that make you go hmmm.	because it is not so much the capitalist theory that is the problem as it is our implementation of it.
1	Not to speak for Jim, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess it was "Rebuttlickan". Just a hunch.	Jim,Just which of my descriptos of Hizzonor Mayor Rudy did you find to be pejorative?
1	Archie, you're not one of those Westboro Baptist Chuch types, are you? You don't buy that stuff about 'God Hates the ### Army' and 'God hates America' do you?	Archie,But since you brought it up, do you want to back this statement up capo? Where have I ever claimed to know all that God knows? How about this from your #148 in Gay Rights:I have spoken of the coming judgment that America is facing because of our iniquity and you are proving just how deserving we are of it with your rebellious and condemning attitude towards the God who holds your very life in His hands. You are showing that you don't appreciate his Grace which He has covered America with for so long, so let's see how you feel when He withdraws His Spirit of Grace from this Country and we implode as a Nation. Why do I think that your next post will dwell on your use of the word all?
1	leroyjames, i am just shocked at your blatantly sarcastic response to kelly ;)	not yet, but my cat and dog have been working on it for years. i'm sure they're close to getting it. ;)
0	Actually I'm so sure of my manhood that even though I knew that charge would be levelled against me I still posted anyway. Anyway if you feel that men need to be degraded to make up for past actions to women you have gone from "righteous" to bitter.	Women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries. I've just gotten tired of it--and righteously so.
1	I did, you rejected my evidence with your usual excuses. Now, tell me about the big bang.	You can add whatever you'd like. That doesn't make it actually true.Tell me again about the flood layer Archie.
1	And this coming from a so called, self proclaimed "rational christian" ? It appears you have blown your cover as a poser by showing your true colors as an anti-christian atheist and a hatemonger. Thanks for revealing your true Nature. emoticonXGood	And yet, who would be the one attacking one of US if we made a similar generalization. YOU.So, Jyoshu, I say to you, Christians are degenerate, homophobic, bigoted, racial cleansers and Nazi supporters. Christianity supports genocide, infanticide, ethnic cleansing, filicide, burning of human beings, and the slaughter of gays.And boy, if I said that out of this current argument, you and Archie and Jims would be all over me. Funny that. emoticonXRolleyes
0	It is pretty bizzare. There are plenty of groups out there that will reach whatever "conclusion" you pay them to reach. Why he didn't cite one of them instead of an easily checkable source that says the opposite of what he says they do is beyond me.	I also visited the university's website and looked at their data. There does appear to be information which contradicts with the above listed article's claims (e.g. - http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/te...ure/nhshgl.gif). Not sure what he is talking about.
0	There's no adding of firearms going on, because they're already there! The criminals have them, that's a hard fact of life that can't ever be changed. Deal with it. What we want is for the intended victims to be on equal footing with the bad guys. There's nothing unreasonable about that.	Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse.
0	A being is something that is conceivable as existing...or something that actually exists.A human being is one of us, a homo-sapien, a member of the group of beings known as animals.A rock is a being of inanimate qualities.God is the supreme being, not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him (or It, or She) on the same level as those that He created.We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!God is great.God is good.Let us thank Him for our food.God is my shepherd.God is my Light.God is my Co-pilot.God is what keeps me from believing that all this (the totality of all things and happenings) came about by accident.When God made man, She was only kidding! ;)	...God does not fill the word "who" because to most accounts he is not a person, or being....
0	So 5,000 to 10,000 women dying from illegal abortions isn't high? Dude, that is nearly five times the number of women who were dying from abortions in the 1940s! That is VERY high!	The figure comes from a 1936 study by Dr. Frederick Taussig who estimated that abortion claimed the lives of 5,000 to 10,000 women a year.
0	And he has still yet to provide one. If more gun-control means more lives saved then more gun-control means more self preservation.	I am merely asking for an objective standard to determine what is and is not a "god-given right." And you STILL have yet to provide one.
0	oh yeah! i remember you man! welcome back. oh, thethinker may be gone but there's a few whack-jobs who have taken his place.	yeah, my profile name at the time was guitarguy11. thethinker and i got into some seriously heated debates. i don't know why though, i would of had better luck arguing with a wall.
0	the fetus would be a real person...and it seems like....in order to make the iraq war/abortion connection....you would have to support the war!	But, I guess that when one worships the Almighty Fetus, the lives of real people are of no concern.
0	anyone who serves in the military is a hero. once you sign on the dotted line and take that oath, you are allowing for the possibility for death by combat at anytime. perhaps others didn't get the recognition she got, but that's not her fault. the media needed a 'darling of enduring freedom' poster child and she got picked.	http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hero she didnt really risk her own life, it was more a case of in the wrong place at the wrong time. she also did not sacrifice her life. she's still alive. to think she was any more a hero than any other serviceman or woman on the front lines is ludicrous, and to tell the truth, many of them arent heroes either. i think titles are passed around to quickly nowadays. now, if you are defending your mates who are injured from 50 ak-47 wielding terrorists and you fend them all off, in the meanwhile losing 2 ligaments, i think thats cause for the use of the title of hero. jessica lynch? hell no. it comes down to how you interpret what a hero is, for me, she is just propaganda for the bush admin (or was). those who cannot see that are fools imho. drummond
1	lol just can't keep a good thing down can you gans? i love how it is only you and archie who have flocked to the thread in utter dismay... i'm sure easy will be right behind carrying a crucifix to ward off the 'gay'..... and no i do not think it will be overturned and i am ecstatic that marriage equality has extended to our nations capitol. let freedom ring baby!!!!	is this likely to be overturned or are congratulations really in order?
0	oh yeah, i went to see the new movie a couple of weeks ago, it's probably the most interesting film i have seen in a long time. i actually bought the book because of the movie and i am going to read it sometime in the near future. looking forward to it!	it does take off slow but the story is amazing and the freaking new movie blew my dick off it was so amazing
1	Nothing anyone has said has proven anything I have said wrong in any way because all you have are unprovable and unproven assumptions. Now go over to the other debate Creation versus evolution like a good little boy and you will get my response to Tiktaalik. Nkaaaay?	All these posts proving Archie wrong, and not one example of his acknowledging this fact has EVER BEEN FOUND! OMG WOWOWOW!!~!@Please, Archie, tell us about Tiktaalik. Go ahead. Yes, I'm serious. Do it.
1	as steve martin once said, 'well, ecuuuuuuse meeeee'. no polar icecaps today? ok what is the proper - pc terminology - that refers to the big chunk of ice, what sits over the top of the north and south regions of the planet? as long as it is not too long of a description or too lame - i can evolve to the next phase and say ...(thus and such)... instead. :) btw. iam sure that algore can remember the meaning of - 'polar icecaps'. sorry that, you can not.	i'm kinda sorry i challenged smallax on this issue, but i'm pretty sure that gore knows there aren't icecaps at the north pole. there are arctic ice caps, such as the big one in greenland, just not at the pole.
1	the evidence that is provided to you is not enough. not that evidence is not given.  nice closed-minded-ness buddy.  ethnocentrism? lol! you're kidding right? you think what i wrote is particular and not broad ranged? what are you assuming here?	evolution is taken as a scientific theory taken as fact based upon a preponderance of factual evidence.  creationism is a theory that is taken as fact without any actual factual basis. also, nice ethnocentrism buddy.
1	Says the man who wants to criminalize being a victim of a crime. :)	Says the man that believes locking your front door is sufficient to secure weapons inside.
1	Hey Matt, if that paintbrush were any broader, you could paint a room in just five minutes	If you don't want to speak out then don't complain that someone is basing their opinion of all evangelicals by phelps's actions.
0	That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do.	Perhaps when the Roman Catholic Church has cleansed itself of its own sins it could have a dialogue with women about abortion--WHICH IS NOT A SIN.
1	You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind.	I was requested to start a new thread in which pro-gay and anti-gay marriage positions could be debated without posters being called "homophobes", "gay bashers" and "bigots" simply because they don't favor gay marriage.While I"ve already stated why I'm against gay marriage in previous threads, I'll reiterate them here for newbies and for simplicity sake.1. Gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizen2. It is an unfunded mandate and therefore, illegal3. It forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefits4. It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody, property, inheritance, etc.,5. It allows more people to lay claim to finite SS and other entitlement benefits6. It establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes.7. It establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts.These should be enough fodder to get the ball rolling.
0	Too much spin there buddy. The potentiality arguement is used by those who believe women have a right to have control over their fertility. As an aside it is also a fundemental tenent in Judaism's view of the unborn- the foetus is a potential life, but has not yet attained that state of being, which occurs at birth.	The potentiality argument is often used against those who do not believe that a fetus is worthy of being called a person, a human, or whatever word you prefer to argue over.
0	Sigma I have taken into account the options a woman has after pregnancy. However, there are no doubt cases in the history of the world (not just within America) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child (ie: the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world). For this pro-choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation. Are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her?	That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her.
0	Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfmIt is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something.	The CBO estimate was ~$1Billion/ year in additional costs for legalizing 600,000 gay marriages.
1	Ah! So wellspoken for an addle-pated twiddle poop! I congratulate you!  And a total lie! Who the Hades wants 13-year-old children to be sexually active? No responsible, thinking person could wish such a thing. You malign Planned Parenthood.  You have ceased to be a credible commentator on this issue.	planned parenthood can't wait to get 13 year old girls on the table to abort their babies..........
1	Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste.	Finally, it just makes sense....it makes physiological change smooth, simple and economical, with minimal waste (death.)
0	you are a very good student of buddha. i am very impressed.	i would argue that the world is in fact buddhist. whether they call their faith or process buddhism or not the experience of suffering and overcome suffering is buddhist by nature.  you can see buddhism being embraced in almost every walk of life be it yoga or atheist solutions to problems / suffering, psychology, self help books. they may not call it buddhism but they are most certainly are buddhist principles repackaged in other forms.
1	Ah yes, the ever popular 3rd grade "they started it" response. Didn't jesus say to turn the other cheek?	"We will not be responsible," Jones said. "We are only reacting to the violence that is already there in that religion." -Terry Jones
1	What makes you think I don't. Yours is not the only religion on earth!! And I didn't just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern, so don't jump to it with me.	It is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul, not how many years you can stay on the earth.
1	Coveting is the basis for capitalism. Without coveting, there is no motivation!	How is following the 10 commandments an interpretation of Christianity or scriptures.Don't murder, don't steal, don't covet, how are those even considered to be interpretable?
1	Just out of interest, which particular aspect of "truth" are you getting at here?	It really does make one wonder though, if there is really nothing to hide, why are pro-abortionists so desperate to hide and mask the truth about abortion?
0	Given that I do not hold that opinion, I would challenge you show where I have stated such.	Even with the Supreme Court ruling, Sinjin and Chet have said otherwise... on the day this was posted!
1	why should a mere little baby have to earn the love of its parents? good god! what kind of parenting is that? i will love you, my child, if you deserve my love.	how do you earn love? what does a baby have to do, for instance, to earn the love of its parents?
1	i'm a communist and i like pie emoticonxdonno how dare you. i'm almost offended but am so intrigued by your avatar that i get a happy feeling inside and forget about it. but please, next time, please consider the communists when using them as an insult. emoticonxgood *although this post is mostly sarcastic, i am being a little bit serious.	translation: i'm a communist, so i don't like pie and neither do my imaginary wife and kids. *puts syklopps61 on the ignore list*
0	Actually both are relative in every situation. Especially "The Truth" as espoused by religious fundamentalists such as yourself, as there are as many different versions of the truth as there religious fundamentalists.	Truth and morality are not relative to any given situation.
0	Both. It's where a human life begins but not a life yet.	Do you believe that a fetus in a women's body is just undeveloped tissue or a start in where human life begins? Undeveloped tissue. Both. Human life.
0	Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition, however inadequately, this doesn't mean they're going to recommend crackpot "raw food" dietary schemes to prevent destructive "lamarckian evolution" on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats.	Doctors should be schooled in nutrition so they can teach their patients how to cure themselves.
0	No offense, but I am in my early teens and understand the situation more than you.	Firstly, i don't know why you're all trying to read in between the lines. I am in my late teens. I am not trying to be compasionate and although i'm not perfect, i can easily decide whether i get pregnant or not.
1	774 billion to china in debt... where are you going to 'buy' new technology? oh right... from china.	while china has more troops, they don't have the equipment to utilize those troops. the chinese may have the largest infantry, but the united states has the most advanced technology, the largest navy, the largest air force, and a lot more purchasing power.
0	oh yeah, i don't disagree. i'm a massive fan of hitchens, and 99% of everything he said was true. he just happened to be, as you say, misguided on certain issues.	i don't think so. a misguided view on foreign policy is bad, but (by your own admission necesary) criticism of those who lack it and a fierce dedication to free speech wouldn't mean hitchens ' failed when applying it to politics' utterly. and as your defense of mother teresa might imply, the advocacy of his good views far outweigh his negatives.
0	Well this involves the free will / determinism debate, you say you aren't free if your preferences are implanted... I say you are free when you act in accordance with your preferences, regardless of how those preferences were arrived at. I think to claim you need to "choose" your preferences is absurd, as the act of choosing requires prior preferences, which presumably also required a choice.... and the question of how we acquired our first preference arises...	. If you can inject me with something that compels me to seek out and drink a coke, then I am not acting freely, and if I am not choosing to act in a certain fashion, then intelligence is not involved, at least not directly, in what I do.
0	I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.	2) Along the same lines, how did the appendages created by mutations actually become something usefull? For example an animal might have developed a wing like appendage, but it wouldn´t have the correct muscles that it would need to actually move the wings.
0	Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?	Humans are the same way. Oh, you might eventually come across a vegetable who isn't able to breed, but I submit that 99.99% of all humans can do so.
1	You put such confidence in articles written by partisan plebes, using unsupported, irrelevant links to make the printed text pseudo-intelligent. I cannot imagine you holding your own in a serious debate.

0	i was awake, just not on at the time you posted this. high school starts waaaayyy to early. anyway, i'm surprised at how many people post while i'm asleep (around 11:30 - 5:30 est)	before all the americans wake up!! the mornings are so quiet for us europeans. emoticonxcry
1	I don't think it's a cover-up. I think that it's a conspiracy between the black helicopters and the aliens beaming suggestions to those without the foil-lined hats on. :)	Thats why the Republicans have brainwashed you in to think that way. It is a coverup after coverup by both partys.
1	Have you stopped beating your wife yet?  Give it up! Good grief! emoticonXDonno	so are saying you believe the democrats shouldn't be milking this? do you think it does gays a disservice? the fact that the author asserts the dems using this does gay people a disservice makes it on-topic, imo.
0	It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)	You may be right, you may be wrong. It doesn't matter to me either way because the Constitution allows the states to do as they wish regarding abortion.
1	Ha.a.a.a :p emoticonXGood Good one, sinjin.  What is the sound of one hand clapping.....?  Ladywolf,  Your answer will probably come from many different sources. Your idea that it evolved is pretty-much it, IMO.	i have no facts but would speculate it was more about punishing those who chose not to marry(rogues) than the other way around. ever notice how wives often have a problem with their husband's single guy friends?
0	And if we can actually doing anything about it. From what I hear on the fringes, the debate should not be about how to change or stop it, but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate.	There isn't. The controversy is over whether it's man-made or not.
1	Look, the "no one was around to see it" argument. "If a tree falls in the woods, and no one was around to see it, did it really fall?" You lost this one a long time ago, too. You never learn.	In typical fashion, and because because your man made science that teaches that the big bang signified the start of time, even though their was evidently no one around to record time back then, but you automatically assume that only after the so called big bang did time begin to exist.
0	True, they can change laws if the are unconstitutional. So what makes a ban on abortion unconstitutional?   Also, what makes the dealth penalty for minors constitutional one day and not the next? In fact 15yrs ago it wasn't an unconstitutional decision. I guess now it is??? Makes no sense.   Clive14,   those are obviously not my beliefs as I think everyone is equal.   I am not sure your wealth makes you different from someone else. It means you wealth is unequal..we are talking about just people. We all end up 6 foot under (so to speak) in the end.	no, but they can change laws if they are unconstitutional. them being irrelevant can however be played as a factor. not an absolute one.
1	How the hell can you narrow it down to three? The competition in the entire top ten is fierce.	Wow - Spetner, Sermonti, and the newest anti-evolution charlatan, Sanford -the trifecta of intellectual vacuousness.

0	But himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which didn't migrate to the plains. And pressures from predators, climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do. My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction.	Because Africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. There are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. Their food sources are different, their territories are different. The more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. Pretty straightforward, really.
0	Well before there was a law someone came up with a difference, I didn't ask if they end result was the same, I asked if there was a difference in the two. Maybe a moral difference or something.	Legally there is a difference. But let's just toss that out for a second. The end result is exactly the same. Eyes fogged over no longer care whether it was fun or self defense.
1	Ah, so when I lobby for burets for my chemistry classes, I'm indoctrinating my kids into the evils of iodometry? *gasp*Yes, it's a stupid as it sounds, because it's analogous to your argument.	Here's more proof for you of the indoctrination that's taking place today in public schools, and the gay lobby bragging about how they got increased funding for their programs. link
1	because gc hears things all woggly. the message from god is for shepherds to tend to ignorant, mindless sheep. but, with dope-smoker ears, and american ignorance it translates into a cowboy...who rustles cattle...and heads them to a quick slaughter. it's like, when the anti-chist makes his appearance, i'll be gods slaughterman. effectively and efficiently removing tru-believahs from the world...cause god forgot some in his rapture thingy (i forget how the logic of these events is supposed to play out...) ummm...aren't we overdue for that bloke to return already? i'm getting antsy for the 2nd coming and all the excitement that leads up to that glorious event. think holding my breath will make it happen any sooner?	why would god want a cowboy to spread his message? after all, cowboys have the stigma of being arrogant, stubborn, oblivious to subtle cultural traits, not the delicate cautious type, so and on so forth. seems like a bad vehicle for god.
0	**Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism.	What I am is someone who appreciates the value of the scientific methodology, and its repeatedly demonstrated power to yield elegant, testable, useful and predictive hypotheses, including - over the past centuries - the discovery and modeling of novel forces at work in nature as well as the Theory of Evolution.

And should it be surprising that members of any industry would want the government to directly finance it?Hell America already has single payer automobile construction, why stop there?What form and style should the fascist state take, is that the question?More and more America resembles a pit of rats, slowly filling with water, all trying to escape by climbing on top of one another. Doctor Rats should be allowed to the top of the rat-pile for the moment right, until the teachers, garbage rats, police or fire rats want their shot at glory.

There are lots of facts that support it . The anthropic principle , the sudden appearance of fossils with no evolutionary past , symbiotic relationships between plants and insects. The fact that dogs have dogs and cats have cats. You interpretation of the evidence is just that your interpretation.

Of course we know that evidence doesn't exist, but they'll never admit that either. emoticonXGood	If all life evolved from a common ancestor, then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving.Body parts such as eyes, muscle, bone, etc.We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously.Evolutionists will wave the magic "time wand" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts.Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction.Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800's. They are still looking.

0	As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think.	You mention pursuing facts? I don't see how that's possible. For now assume that God created the Earth and the science commnity accepts that. What specific experimentation would you do? What would you investigate that you feel could further the human pool of knowledge? How about some specifics?

0	Not at all. The issue is receiving the marriage benefits. If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?	1) The context changes nothing.The comment is the same with or without more sentences surrounding it.2) "rejected giving marriage rights/benefits to unmarried straight couples"??? emoticonXDonno That's like saying, "I believe that black votes should not be counted, and whites who choose not to vote should also not have their votes counted."To try and compare a situation where one group has the CHOICE to use a right, and then chooses not to, to a second group that is DENIED that choice, is mind-bogglingly absurd. emoticonXBanghead
0	Actually all decisions based on the self ARE selfish decisions. I really don't care. I make them all the time too. Everyone does. While this is a philosophical issue I really see it as odd that people claim not to be selfish when doing something that benefits them or prevents harm to them with little regard to anyone else.	I'm not selfish, whether you or your buddy JP like to think so or not - I just look at actual reality rather than a fantasy world.
0	Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.	Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible – the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark – convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as “one theory among others” is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.

Certainly, because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally.To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony, right, and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by....
0	correct. did you notice that in the scott peterson trial, the judge went around the law in deciding how he should be punished and who has rights? a clear sign of activism, yet none of the righties called him a activist judge even when what he did is by defintion activism. it's a sign they are hugely hypocritical.  vor's got a raging double standard if he calls some judges who do that activist and others who do the same, not.	activists judges, is a phrase used to describe jodges who do not rule in favor of radical religious ideology. just as the phrase politcal correctness is always used by 'consevatives' (i put them in quotes because there is a huge difference between conservatives and reactionaries that label themselves 'conservatives') to describe indignation at describing different segments of the population in insulting terms.

0	As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to "purpose." And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase "survival of the fittest" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time "survival of the fittest" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory.	It doesn't do this, because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends'... other than survival, and survival simply come about because organisms survive (hence the tautology of "Survival of the Fittest" which Darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to "Natural Selection").
0	And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).	Yes we can create modern technological wonders. The pyramids, the Twin Towers, and Meer. Alas, as was so truthfully spoke by Isaac Asimov, "The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom." Just look at us and ask the question "What are we doing?" There are some of us that are attacking innocent civilians, others who won't lift a finger to help out of sheer arrogance, others who are too decadent to do anything.
0	But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not. It's prejudice, pure and simple, and you're no exception. Now, one would think, being the supposedly non-Christian enlightened person you are, you would simply say "oh, I didn't realize that my posts came across as anti-Christian sometimes, and that it indicates a prejudice on my part, and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking." I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking.	Of course, if you get a muslim in here making similar claims to the claims that Christianity makes, you will get an equal reaction from the same people who critize Christianity (for the exact same reasons)
1	oh, so business owners don't make 'real' contributions to society? whoa boy, slow down there. i didn't say that government offices should be passed down. what are you going to do...make inheritence illegal? you didn't read my answer obviously. just because people have money doesn't mean they have to share it. the government doesn't have the right to take money away from the rich and give it to the poor. so what if rich people don't give money to the poor! it's their choice. god tells us to give money to the poor, but he also gave us a free will. it's not the governments responsibility to help the poor, it's the church's responsibility.	i thought that this would be a good thread to distinguish between socialism and communism. i think most people do not really understand the differences between the two.

0	i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic.	atheism is not a belief in the typical sense. it is a non-belief. it is the abscence of belief.  a theist is one who beleives in one form of a diety or another.  the prefix 'a' means without. thus an atheist is one without a beleif in one form of a diety or another. as to the idea of your question my non beleif comes from the lack of evidence and logic in support of god as well as a lack of understanding of what is meant by 'god'.
1	I've decided that I will answer this question once and for all if someone can prove to me why people need tennis racquets. If someone can answer this for me, I will attempt the definitive assault weapon response. Have at it.	but who really needs an assult rifle anyway
1	Yeah, the lesbians. emoticonXRolleyes It would also mean the end of the human race. emoticonXGood	wouldn't a world without men make many women happy? I can think of at least one in this forum.
1	I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant? That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!	For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)
0	Erm... we are? Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million, currently a little over 380ppm, 150 years ago closer to 280. In 1970 about 330ppm.   Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia	i am new to the forum and was just reading through a few of the posts. i like archangel's line of reasoning here.  to take it another step, i remember reading in high school the percentages of, what elements made up the atmosphere. o, n, and about 2% of all the other elements combined. those 2% included co2 and had a number specifically attached to it. i don't remember what that number was, but if it were 'actually' showing measurable increases, why are we not all kept up to speed on how drastic the increases are? [i.e. 1970 it was 0.0123% and now it is 0.0124%]. i also remember at university there was a big deal about an aluminum plant in southern california or maybe mexico that was constantly blowing smoke into a particular mountain range that was growing trees. so scientists started studying the ill effects of all this pollution on the trees. does anyone know what was discovered?
0	so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it.	did you watch the video? this is not about liberals vs. conservatives. the argument is that a childs success is not by any means proportional to the sexual orientation of its parents. mr. wahls is an example of that. good parenting and luck is what's needed to instigate success in a child. you seem to insinuate that is done only by 'liberals' (man, i hate that term). this is simply rhetorical analysis 101. pathos to be exact. you appeal to a persons emotions. it's a marketing ploy used by advertisers and politicians and is not particular to the left. i assume you're describing the up your alley sections of that website which is hardly representative of the entire homosexual community.
1	oh yeah god is the root of all evil! tell that to the person who was about to murder their spouse for cheating but refrained from doing so because they believe that god is watching. how about that damn evil mother theresa too	money is only the root of all evil. actually god is, but money is in second place.
1	lmao seriously i rarely show emotion, but that's funny. 1. how does that compare to 9/11 exactly? 2. at least that guy was aprehended, where's osama again? oh yeah that's right, we were busy in a random country in the mid-east because some president's daddy was there and jr wanted to show how cool he was. bush should have stuck to bankrupting professional baseball teams and oil companies. and conservatives have no leg left to stand on... literally your pirate avatar is fitting as insulting as you would wish it were. take out your peg leg and try to stand on an issue. current republicans = bought and owned by private interest. those sad soles defending it = easily persuaded and uneducated. i know because i'm an elite liberal. i regularly laugh at how dumb you are.	get a grip will ya... ever heard of fort hood? http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33678801/ns/                                       us_news-crime_and_courts/  and i even supplied a msnbc link just to be sure you would say 'fox lies'
0	do away with scholarships, too. oh yes. humans have a natural desire to learn. are ever learning.  besides, you don't need two to three years to prepare for these exams, nor do you need a public high school to help you prepare for them. teachers must assess all the time in order to teach. the issue there is not grades, but assessment. the appropriate methods varying, for different teachers. you believe that, because you don't know anything else.	yes, we have. a student with a 3.9 gpa and a low sat and/or act score will get relative piddle for academic scholarships. wait, you're a parent? and you think that sat/act performance two or three years down the road serves as sufficient motivation to freshmen in lieu of grades? you think grades aren't necessary to help teachers see how their students are learning? i agree that the gpa system can be misleading, but devoid of an alternative, we have to keep it.
0	Could you please cite where you are getting this biological definition of evolution?	Evolution is a change in the frequency in alleles in a population over time.
1	studies from 1955, 1961, 1964? i believe that a lot has happened since those years.	http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/e...cle/002398.htm and http://www.ehd.org/resources_bpd_doc...e=11#chapter23 in particular this one references:  78] borkowski and bernstine, 1955, 363 (cited by bernstine, 1961, 63 & 66; orahilly and mller, 1999a, 195; van dongen and goudie, 1980, 193.); hamlin, 1964, 113. for a summary of in utero fetal encephalography (measuring brainwaves) in the near- term fetus using abdominal and vaginal electrodes see bernstine et al., 1955. i think these are adequate. ef
0	Yes, the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards!!   If you hate your job that much, quit. You aren't being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something. If you don't like it, don't do it. If you hate trade, you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots.	Rich people do a lot more to oppress people and take away freedom than the government
0	This joke is based on some reality, "the conquest of the North Pole is traditionally credited to Anglo-American Navy engineer Robert Edwin Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909.   Anyhow, not all jokes are completely true, how many stand up comedians have you heard??? If you were to nit pick every joke out there (being politicaly correct etc) there would be no jokes left!	I don't see anyone protesting at this "joke." A good joke is at least based on some reality.
0	Oh joy another drive by with absolutely no proof or evidence.	Assuredly, a very high state of being constantly afraid.
0	No! At conception we are a person and human.All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.	We are human at conception. The sperm and ovary cells are human before they even connect. A fingernail clipping is human.What you mean is; when do we become a person.
0	Well I'm glad its no problem for your son. No child deserves to be harrassed.	Oh it has happened. But that is not a problem with my son, me or his father - it is a problem for the pathetic hate-mongers who carried out the acts of harrassment.
1	i know! i should totally be sorry and ashamed for being such a horrible liar... i mean a dick sucking homosexual and a liar! oh i'm going to the seventh circle for sure... except one little tidbit easilyridden. i didn't lie!!!  embarrass? hun you forget who wears the tiara in this forum....	yeah - jason - you should be ashamed of yourself for being such an outright liar. you have an incredibly sordid reputation around here and it just gets worse every time you embarrass yourself like this.
1	You really don't get it. The best thing about a free market is when someone acts like a fool they get burned. Thanks to government intervention and regulation when someone acts like a fool they get bailed out.   If you like we can have the trains run like Amtrak.	With all that evidence right in front of them, why do so many stupids call Obama a socialist?
0	This coming from the person that makes insane claims without providing evidence. Atleast provide some when asked!	I see...a lack of substance on your behalf. Anything to fill the void after a rather damning debunk on the thread I suppose. A very typical tactic on your behalf and I would not expect more.
0	Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose.And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves?And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around...What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol...But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content.	I keep hearing gays say that but every time it's put to a vote, you lose. I'd say that it's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition. The only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action. And when they respond on the ballot, they do so punatively.Just wait until you see the repercussions of the current efforts to give ALL Federal Employee's same sex partners bennies on OUR DIME despite DOMA. I'm guessing that some additional Democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies.You need a PR strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences. I believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but NOT marriage. And I count myself amongst that majority.
1	so your saying he was 200% god-man? i'm not a mathematician but that can't be right surley.	I think you are forgetting the fact that He was 100% God and 100% man. I don't understand what you are trying to argue.
1	Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of "proofs" reveal themselves. What's next, Nostradamus?	This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising "proofs" if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, "explain" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?Ecclesiastes 1:6The wind goes toward the south,And turns around to the north;The wind whirls about continually,And comes again on its circuit.  How did they know that the earth "hangs on nothing" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?Job 26:7He stretches out the north over empty space;He hangs the earth on nothing.  How did they know that the "vapors" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?Jeremiah 10:13When He utters His voice,There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:“And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.He makes lightning for the rain,He brings the wind out of His treasuries.”  Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC—more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.Genesis 7:11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.The story goes "They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along."
0	So Lewontin is the person who determines the opinion of the general public or something?	Miller continues;His mistake here, is that evolution isn't any of those social moral things because it shouldn't be. Yet he clearly shows, from Lewontin's words, that it IS.
1	Who is Allah, Alex? Great, I'll take 'things a terrorist god would do' for $1600 Alex.	If God wanted to, He could raise up people from other countries to fly planes into buildings.
1	So how is the oil and gas agreement with China working out for you antipodeans?	If only more people were armed this tragedy might have been minimised.
1	Congratulations, Hunter. You have just accepted the 5 primary tenets of fundamentalism. So I guess that makes you a fundamentalist.	1. Bible inerrancy:2. The divinity of Jesus:3. The virgin birth:4. The belief that Jesus died to redeem man:5. An expectation of the Second Coming, or physical return of Jesus Christ to initiate his 1000-year rule on earth:
1	My article say's this. it needs to be noted the alleged evidence for extensive history assumes uniformitarian geology. Because of this fact, this response adds up to: Your theory doesn't work under my theory, so your theory is wrong. Of course you don't want to consider that fact, do you?	your own quoted article states that your source is wrong, and then goes on to say basically that since they don't like the accepted geological explanation, they won't pay it any mind. The reason for Pandion's frustration is that this is a PRATT argument.
1	Great job straight out of the leftard playbook. Can't refute the message so go after the messenger. Would it matter if it was printed in the NY Slimes, I doubt it.	"Baldwin says his research not only 'confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals,' but it found that 'the mainstream homosexual culture' even 'commonly promotes sex with children.' "Report: Pedophilia more common among 'gays'Another fine example of "objective" reporting from the World Net Daily.
1	perhaps you should smoke a lot less crack? funny isn't it how the people who say that invariably want a larger government? btw adam smith, aka 'miguel sanchez', is a prominent mexican free market economist and spiritual leader of the latino pride movement, with suspected ties to people smuggling and drug trafficking operations along the californian border. his magnum opus the wealth of mexicans details an insidious plot to bring down racial equality through free market principles, estabilishing a millenium of full spectrum mexican dominance of the american financial, legal and industrial systems. the only barrier to his evil plot? patriotic americans who understand the benefits of government control in all aspects of their lives. i'm surprised someone as educated on such a diverse array of issues as yourself hasn't come across him.	single payer would give you a lot less government. though border control certainly takes more. still, 'more government' or 'less government' -- this vague phrase you keep throwing out -- is not the point. the point is cost-effective health care for all americans and the integrity of our national borders, and all that goes with it. i would agree with that. don't know the writer, but i agree, it's revolting c**p. mexico is a very racist society in many ways.
1	But in all reality an embryo is inside a uterus, living solely through a placenta and a two month old baby is not. That is a significant difference. One may argue how significant, but it is silly to say the only difference is time.	But in all reality.. a baby is no more different at 2 months old than an embryo...
0	Just like no one is really "for" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war.	Getting back to the original question...yes, i think it is very reasonable to be against abortion and for a war. I don't thin anybody is "for war", but rather "for a war". Each one is different and needs to be evaluated separately.
1	Yeah. It's snowing sooner here in the Midwest. I think the next Ice Age is coming.	Whether it is man made or natural or both factors work together; I think it is the beginning of serious changes in the atmosphere.
0	Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise.	The process to fossilize a bone is painfully slow. Non-fossilized tissue can't survive more than a few years, let alone long enough for any other part of the bone to become fossilzed! It would decompose!
1	Try and comprehend this child, your siggy is your OPINION. It is evidence of nothing real or imagined. Only in your mind does it prove anything at all.	Actually it is. You keep arguing that everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist, when they clearly are not. The rest of my signature backs that up. Furthermore, your constantly claims about your religious rightness fail due to the simple fact that your religion is not the only religion.
0	i'd say out of the 6 billion people on earth at least 4 billion of them are richer right now than they would be had the economic systems never changed since the era of globalization began. i don't think the number is as small as 3 people. how doesn't it lead to stability. think china and their reform to capitalism and westernization. are them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation? it will be stabilizing to have them westernize. however, it isn't necessarily good. yeah i can see what you mean. the people are just about ready to burst because the us and canada depend so much on each other. nor did i. whew, we agree on something :) isn't that the truth.	so three people getting filthy rich while everyone else starves is a good thing? cultural degradation doesn't lead to stability, sorry. and again, how is this good? not at all, as it makes people want to revolt. i never said all dictatorships were caused by the us.  .... that you know of.
1	were you hiding under a rock until recently? phelps has been making the news for years for showing up at gay (and other) funerals. i think they even had a phelps-based character picketing funerals in one of those pc gay-rights themed movies like the laravie project didn't they?	well it seems that no one minded him showing up at gay funerals it was only when he started showing up at military funerals people started noticing. as far as the music we all might just join you for a good dance. i still say 3, 4, and 5 are non disruptive speech and forms of speech you don't like. or i should say if it were conservatives doing it to liberals you would have no problem.
1	Bush is a Luddite...Yadda, yadda, yadda..... Bush is the anti-Christ ...Yadda, yadda, yadda emoticonXRolleyes	Yeppers, GW sure isn't a civil engineer and he won't listen to one word they say because he doesn't believe in civil engineering. And he doesn't believe in science, evolution, and medical evidence, come to think about it. He just believes that his is the word of God.
1	no... a debased intellect has things backwards, that would clearly be minds of your ilk buddy. so.. what then? your heart tells you to go jump off a cliff? on contrast that old you book you claim tells me to sit down and live a day, guess what i'm gonna do? go live a day... and avoid watching them have to scrape you off the ground. that old book is about reason, respect, love decency and standards that preserve life... a fallen heart cannot be trusted. i trust a heart governed by that book... rather than a mind with no self control living for the 'heart' - they give heart a bad name. sorry pal... i dont' expect you to understand it, and i am fine with that - it is your choice, but it hasn't been wrong ever, and never wronged anybody.	you would think open indulgence in any and every proclivity known to man qualifies as thinking for themselves.
1	how about when it dawns on you who he was when he came the first time? lol! trade in your blinders for some spiritual light!	hasn't everyday since christ been latter days, thousands of days and he hasn't returned as promised. in the bible his return was right around the corner.....how many years has it been. when will you realize he isn't coming back for you!
1	Yup, I get the drift. You're the sort that is in denial about how he feels about gays; equating tolerance for gays with tolerance for murderers, while pretending you're doing something else. Now I know how you think, thanks!	There's no comparing gays to murderers in anything I wrote, Kronus. That's your creation and attempt to belittle. The discussion was on TOLERANCE AND INTOLERANCE. The quote I was responding to was: "It is perfectly acceptable to be intolerant of intolerance." Get the drift now?
1	Oh, but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant.	Sina mostly followed instructions and smiled alluringly at men because she would have been beaten if men didn't choose her. But sometimes she was in such pain that she resisted, and then she said she would be dragged down to a torture chamber in the basement.“Many of the brothels have these torture chambers,” she said. “They are underground because then the girls' screams are muffled.”As in many brothels, the torture of choice was electric shocks. Sina would be tied down, doused in water and then prodded with wires running from the 220-volt wall outlet. The jolt causes intense pain, sometimes evacuation of the bladder and bowel — and even unconsciousness.
0	I can see what you are saying. It's pretty much true...being a Jewish homosexual, I know it first hand. But just for once, couldn't they pick on somebody else?It seems almost like a bully tactic for the Christian heterosexuals who are against same sex marriages to pick on someone who doesn't have a legal leg to stand on...that's sad.	I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.
1	ROFLMAO! Nice way of restating the 'inaccurate' statement basically the same way.	What the theory of evolution states is that monkeys and apes came from a common ancestor, and that humans are apes from a taxonomy point of view.
1	oh ok, so I assume you don't live in your own house? I was trying to picture over 61 people fitting into one house. :)	We have post-graduate and internation student halls, but most of the other post-grads are students anyway (or it might be because Scotland secretly considers me as a international student being from england)
1	Talk about incoherent wishful thinking. Instead of unsubstantiated claims and baseless attacks, why don't you provide, oh, I don't know, mybe some peer-reviewed EVIDENCE? You know, that little old thing that is required for anyone to take your wild claims even remotely seriously?	blah, blah, blah is right. Thanks for the meaningless tripe. I realize you want to believe that evolution is fact but you yourself admit it's only a theory and a false and fraudulent one at that. You evos repeat the same incoherent wishful thinking as you contradict yourselves from one example to the next. People who can believe such inconsistency in science must truly prefer ignorance to enlightenment. So enjoy your ignorance but don't expect me to stop asking the questions that expose how unreasonable and impossible this fraudulent science is. And wouldn't it be great that rather than giving the same old canned responses that are based in the same old false assumptions, and the mocking insults toward me, that your side actually dealt with the questions asked. Only them, with objective and serious consideration will you evos realize how you have been duped by scientific gibberish and pseudo intellectual psycho babble that lead very simple people into thinking that with such big words and so scientific a vocabulary, the lie of evo must be at least based in truth. I submit to you that nothing could be further from the truth.
1	Oh, I see. So America does not care for the rights of the people? America cares only for the opinion of the majority? Hrm, that's funny. I fail to remember learning that part in all my US history classes. When did the founding fathers say that? Where in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or the Bill of Rights might I find such a notion?  'Rouge	here in america if the majority wants it, the majority gets it. you don't have to agree or like it, but you do have to deal with it.
0	Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.But, do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang?Or do you think that the Big Bang didn't happen?	a rational explanation of what caused the big bang etc.
