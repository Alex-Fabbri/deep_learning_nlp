0	well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.	How in any sense is creationism the alternative?
1	yeah, ez is what will come back to haunt you. hay ez you know why i can say anything i want about jesus with out consequence? it's because jesus never existed. sleazy, when are you going to grow up?	- revelation 6:8 beware of what you say about jesus because i guarantee you it will come back to haunt you.
1	Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?	So the debate is just whittled down to two factions; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs.
0	That sounds like an honest answer. How did you feel about it at the time? How do you feel about it now? Just trying to educate myself more.   Huck	another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on (acording to the doctors i spoke with) - i would be unable to work - that's four months, and while right now i am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that, back then i was just starting out, and would be unable to do so.
1	Why would I want lies , deceptions and superstition? I mean, if believing in Jesus makes people act like you, NO THANKS	Then read John 3:36 because it applies to people like you who deny Christ.
1	Looks like my first response to this was deleted? I'll risk it again since this post was not deleted.  Anyhoo,  This post just wreaks of the emotional and psychological development, maturity, morality, character, and integrity of SOME Republicans/Conservatives. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy	well, when the civil war begins, i have no doubts we will win..afterall, we would be facing wimps, sissies and snivelling little brats
1	Care to post some proof or should everyone just believe it because you say it?..	Hitler was definitely gay.He couldnt have proper sex with a woman.He surrounded himself with big beefy males .He liked to walk around in leather shorts.Have you seen his speeches..they are as camp as you can getHe loved to watch musicals.he had an enormous chip on his shoulder and an inferiority complexHe was gay alright.As for Goering.....
0	It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!	Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?
0	you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are. any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what "morals" should be drawn out of the biomorphs.	So, this magical program that is supposed to represent life actually can also produce aeroplanes!
1	loll i love how you completely ignore the link i posted ehh?? and then you downvoted me and tried to sound smart afterwards, but actually made yourself look like twice a fool. :d. you better upvote me again. smh. hah.	if it is bs as you say, then you should be able to easily provide rebuttals to each and every acronym, no?
0	Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.	The fossil record does not support this.
0	Almost? Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.	The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population.
1	So, am I looking for attention or am I mentally ill?	Once some of that turns up, I will start to keep an open mind to your side of the story.
1	much more is happening in the world today than your little gay crusade matthew. but keep your single issue, and totally limited perspective in life, that's what you're good at. could you post where i said that revelation speaks to the rcc vs the protestant reformation ms ? as christ was a jew trebor, his followers wont ever cease to exist, just as god has preserved the jew according to his promises. i'm surprised you can't appreciate that my friend.	actually, it will continue till christianity is a dead religion, cause 'jesus' is not returning..
0	Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By "true human" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent. I have got to go to school, continue this later.	It begins to look, then, that this is a piece of crude propaganda (see note below), deliberately manipulated to give the false impression that the fact of evolution is seriously under scientific question, and that the fanciful notions of creation `scientists' are contributing to that debate.
0	No. I never mentioned grades. You brought that one up. I'm saying that having guns on school campus isn't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area.	So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?
1	"while at home" huh. When did your right to self-defense end at your property line?That is quite a stretch from an old bubble gum chewer even like yourself sliiiick.Thank G-d I live in Texas!!! Those facists states are already failed states so it is semantics anyway when the slaves get restless. criminals are a tyrants wanna be best friend.Everyone should know by now that the cops have no duty to defend anyone no matter the excuses...you are on your own. Everyday I read about the predator leos preying on the electorate so which is worse?	I don't believe Mr. Hamm was refering to the issue of CCW at all, just the right to defend oneself while at home.
0	You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples.	This entire issue was dealt with on this threat here, starting at post250.
1	are you kidding? uh, i hate wasting my 1000th post on you, but here goes. i don't believe that the pm was vile and profane, because jitobear doesn't do that unless you get her really ###### off. second, you're not the most credible person on this forum. and no one has lost it. maybe in your mind, but not in reality. is this how you react when you're cornered, when your bible rhetoric fails? because its kind of pathetic.	but there's still hope for you all if you'll turn from your anti-biblical folly and quit with your failed moral relativism.
0	Well that is good that you recognize our society eats too much meat and too much protein. Now will you agree with me that you can get all the protein you need from whole wheat bread, oatmeal, beans, corn, peas, mushrooms, and broccoli? Now granted some vegetarians eat alot of junk food, and in that case they are NOT getting the right amount of protein. But many vegans like myself dont eat ANY junk food and follow the recommended food pyramid for vegans. I follow it very strictly and I know beyond any doubt that I am more healthy than the vast majority of Americans out there.	It is only because we eat too much meat and I had said that before.
0	I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.   Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.   You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth.	however, most religions that i consider 'christian' are really not the same as 'catholic.'
0	The anti-abortionists claim a load of **** on many issues. I don't listen to them. To put the "life" of an unfertilized egg above that of a person is grotesquely sick IMO. I support any such stem cell research wholeheartedly.	The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.

0	So God gets to do these terrible things, but He gets a free pass because He's God?Kinda funny what happens when you show Archie that the Bible doesn't even support his beliefs, isn't it guys?I still like the fact that the Bible says not to count children under one month of age as persons, yet here Archie expects us to count a zygote as "a human life."	If your knowledge of the bible, and your understanding of Gods holy nature is so limited as to not know the answer to these questions Matthew, then me answering them isn't going to change your mind about anything you currently believe.

1	Other than the Soldini firearms were purchased legally there is no proof that he had a concealed carry permit. If he had the AP and the rest of the left-tard media (redundancy alert) would still be shouting it from the roof tops. Just because the Brady bunch-VPC says so doesn't make it true. Then what else can we expect from a self confessed torturer of helpless small animals and arsonist?	Six people out of, at the very least one million, at the very most five million.Are you really gonna prosecute one million plus people based on the actions of six individuals?
1	Ah yes, the 'Let's pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult, therefore god exist' routine. That arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique, or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to Christianity. It does drive them away, so please, be my guest and keep on trying to use it. I figure the ratio of people you drove away from Christianity to those people who were converted to Christianity from you must be way lop sided.	And I say you're both spiritually-challenged and don't know what you're talking about.Jesus is Lord and all who deny him are antichrists (1 John 2:22).And anybody who's a Trebor-trekkie can't be all there anyway.

0	Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.	It seems to me the corollary of the phrase "abortion is murder" is "miscarriage is manslaughter", and that any consistent pro-life advocate must urge any mother who accidentally loses her child due to actions she undertook, be charged with manslaughter.I wonder, is this actually the case?

0	State courts can rule based on state and/or federal law. In this case, the answer was found in the state constitution, so the judge did not need to pursue the issue further.Also, a state constitution can offer more protection that the federal one, as long as, in so doing, it does not contradict the federal constitution.	The California judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the Federal Constitution; it would have to be taken to the Federal Courts for that.

0	Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them.

They will not necessarily get paid less, there will just be fewer of them.

The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.	What if the answer to that was 0?

0	No Peeling, it would be, "We proved it was possible to evolve as humans have, so why can only we do it?" Why hasn't one other creature on Earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution? If evo is real, then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that weren't forced into extinction, but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years.Unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever. And that is my claim and belief.	I can't recall the name of this particular fallacy, but if I were to name it it would be the "If it were possible, someone would have done it already" fallacy, the consistent application of which leads one to believe it is impossible for anything to happen for the first time.

0	I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.	Because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist, "ToE", that is, that such novel trait changes/'expressions' originate from-- "Random Genetic Mutation", coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that "Natural Selection" does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring.

First thing I want to say is that I dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option.

0	you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there.	as i said previously, 'tookie's' defenders seem to be overzealous in their defense of the man (i can only take your word for it since i really haven't been paying much attention), but i do not see how their accusations have anything to do with hate crimes, and your perceptions of how they're enforced.

0	addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails	If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created.
1	as i observed earlier, you seem intent on attacking islam. why else would you devote so much energy to a thread entitled 'muhammed's child bride'? you've said it yourself, as in... and... howard suggested to you that you might learn something about islam by reading rumi. you asked me to quote to you from rumi? very well... spring is christ, raising martyred plants from their shrouds. their mouths open in gratitude, wanting to be kissed. the glow of the rose and the tulip means a lamp is inside. the wind is the holy spirit. the trees are mary. the scent of joseph's shirt comes to jacob. a red carnelian of yemeni laughter is heard by muhammad in mecca. and... moses, the inner light of revelation, lit up the top of sinai, but the mountain could not hold that light.	though i realise this in itself is predisposing me slightly (maybe significantly) to one side, i think it is important to be able to argue your point from the opponents side if you really want to convince or convert someone.
0	so you get to whine and moan and complain (lie) that i didn't address your points, then when i challenge you to support your points against my counterarguments, you say that you don't need to. you're a hypocrite, archie.  ignore it? bhbcu64 made a valid point and made significant elaborations. the only responses we've seen are 'you're wrong' with no explanation, and two 'why does this follow?'s, apparently due to ignorance of that pesky little thing called law.	in fact, you know that even they got it when they ignore it.

If Christianity included gays you would still be one JJ.You think Jesus hates you so youre getting your own backemoticonXRolleyes
0	You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.	You just wish to ignore them as you do everything that contridicts your belief.
1	* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)	true

0	And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world.	I hope you dont believe everything that is written in a textbook that has been changed over and over.

1	You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men.	My question is thus, should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child's unruleiness?
0	AGREED!!!!That has to be BY FAR the best series I've ever read!Also, Asimov's Foundation triligoy is good.

I think Orson Scot Card who wrote:Enders Game,Speaker For The Dead,Children Of The Mind,Xinocide,Enders Shadow,Shadow Of The Hegemon and,Shadow Pupetsis by far the best author that ever lived or ever will live!!!

1	that's me, and proud of it. but i guess you get your jollies when pagan religious symbols or a pagan religious event can be displayed / practiced, but to heck with anything that might resemble christianity? real nice and equitable there, moose.  it got me a lot of 'excellent!' and 'way to go!' remarks from a number of co-workers.  bull. i've seen it, though it's been many decades now. get real. halloween itself is a pagan religious event, if you will do some research for a change. once again, pagan-related religious themes are fine, but screw the christians.  aren't you one of the libs who tries to sell their 'tolerance' (except for anything christian)? reckon so.	did that move get you voted employee of the month from your co-workers?
0	Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist.	I don't have the right  to make accusations about logical fallacies and how do you know I don't know what they mean.
0	I responded to your posts on the thread of "Lets discuss the actual..." I suggest we continue that discussion there.	You made a 'just-so' statement about what is scientific method, and your own talkorigins site suggested this was one of several philosophies.Further you said definitions don't need to be justified/proven, and again I cited talkorigins that shows this isn't the case.

0	Well, their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig. No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all. Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it's money and political and emotional capital. Stick a fork in them Lucy, they are done emoticonXHoho	So according to the Anti-gun side, we should see a humongous progression of citizen killings of innocent citizens, or in other words, criminals, as the number of Concealed Carry states pass their laws and allow permit holders carry concealed handguns.
0	No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.	Evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change
0	This is a push to promote lawlessness. The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example. People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws. This is a devastating precedent for our Nation.

1	Oh, I get it. So you believe, but you don't exactly "believe".	i am agnostic not atheist, but its close enough for close minded people to understand
1	What's sick is your theological comprehension.  God took Ananias and Sapphira (Acts chapter 5) off the earth just for lying. And you want to give JFK, the serial adulterer, a pass? That's how lame your theological thinking is.	have you never sought counseling for your malady?
1	Sigma, I was only joking. It hit me this morning though that if I'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God, I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up "women's rights". ;-)	Not all who are "left" hate God.
1	Speaking from ignorance once again, eh SP? Did you, by chance, ever read the 2000 Census form? Did you happen to see the category "unmarried partner"? I didn't think so. Now, go eat some crow. emoticonXHoho   http://www.census.gov/population/www...0/samesex.html	Yes, JP is using his usual tactic of bait and switch, starting out with a claim, and then replacing it with something that he thinks we won't notice is different.As foundit also pointed out, his statistics show "same-sex" households, which can mean roommates, etc.
1	So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others, should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not?	The figures for the number of gun related deaths in the US should be evidence enough that 'the people' cannot be trusted with guns.
1	Hmm.. does that include the Muslim Communities you were associated with too?.. We know as rational people that Denial is the Christians best weapon. You should seriously consider increasing your medications..	Especially since I, a born again believer is here adamantly denying that I or every christian community I have ever been associated with would ever support or endorse a christian oligarchy in the USA.

0	Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.	ANY aspect of science that can be discredited helps strengthen the creationist stance.
1	I dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  Once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  We are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but I am sure the preacher would condemn that too  If you read the link you would know.  If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  You really should try to use your little head more.  'Lets stay on topic' who made you a mod?emoticonXChicken	and for someone who doesn't tolerate government intrusion, you sure seem to like government intrusion when it comes to interfering with marriage.
0	Use some basic comprehension indeed. How do you think Dohzhansky 'produced' assortative mating? It was by letting the laboratory population go on interbreeding for enough generations - exactly as happens when assortative mating occurs within or between natural populations. What, did you imagine he operated on them, or something? Geeeeez..	How do you ignore that?
1	Yeah, and we all know what happened when they did that with Galileo. emoticonXRolleyes	Because the RCC has held for centuries that their version of "THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH" trumps scientific fact.
0	Because, when each is in its natural habitat, they are reproductively isolated.	so why do they call polar bears and brown bears different "species" when they can breed and produce fertile offspring together?
1	Strange, I thought it was supposed to be a global flood that wiped out all of man except the chosen few. That would be 'involving Australia' one assumes.	It's more probable that the other culture(s) stole it from the descendants of Noah in the first place.As for Xcaliber's Tourette Syndrome rant about having to go to Australia to pick up Koala bears, God doesn't need to do that.
1	i think you underestimate the intelligence of a 6 year old and what they can comprehend............... and that 6 year old is not only the people but the future which makes it even more imperative that he or she know the sacrafices others have made to make this country the great country it is........ i am not surprised you call it brainwashing though....... emoticonxrolleyes	and i think you have it a little mixed up, this country is the people.

1	But you sure don't hesitate to portray them that way when you use one to bolster the other! Or when you fail to actually (GASP) qualify the matter by noting the differences as well as the similarities. Hey, it's just accuracy, so why get in a fuss over it, huh? emoticonXRolleyes Why not go ahead and invoke the Jewish genocide while you're at it, or call anyone who has a different opinion "Hitler?" I mean it's the same sort of generalization.	In the name of all that is evil and unholy ...Jyoshu - I have never said that the civil rights movement of blacks and gays are identical!Not once!
0	But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority.	The problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people.
0	So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?	I don't believe in any gods, but thankyou for assuming anyone who disagrees with your ridiculous assertions about proving gods non-existance must be a theist.Just like creationists assume anyone who disagrees with creationism must be an atheist.You're just as bad as them, and your arguments, if you could call them that, just as short on substance.
1	like in afghanistan? hopefully it will go a little better with this puppet, his own bodyguard was the latest in a slew of assasination attempts.	no one likes war but you got to do what you got to do.

0	So producing a child is the defining characteristic of a marriage? What about love, trust, respect, companionship? My wife and I may decide to not have a child, does that mean our marriage should be made illegal? Again, you keep posting nambla this and nambla that. Nambla is a group of deviant pedophiles, homosexuals despise this behavior too. GROW UP DHARD...I mean DMG2FUN. ;)	When two gay men get together and have sex that produces a kid is the day I will defend gay marriages.Plus if this is ok then why do gays need organizations like nambla to recruit children into the gay life style.
0	Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?	Not in matters of science.
0	No more so than the Scalia/Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case.	And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.
0	And as their populations grew over thousands of years, civilizations seperate out and independent nations form, laws are set up, and some prosper while others wallow in poverty, how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets? Nice dream, but real life does not work like that.	As much as I'd love pacifism and peace and tolerance and all that wonderful stuff, and I do believe, as my signature says, that violence is the last refuge of the incompetent, it can't be helped so long as we live in a world where people think they need violence.
0	take a look at your post no. 80 time-stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said ...in response to my post #79 wherein i said: does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say? back in post #77, i requested that you quote and debunk the links. you merely scoffed at them (as i expected). prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument, please explain the above. i'll be back next week.	not once did i change the meaning of anything you said, so unless you'd like to quote where i did that, all you have is baseless assertions and a cool method of squirming out of statements you cant support

0	so what about jesus' life is credible if the source is unreliable? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead? what did the authors get right? i mean, i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace. but you dont. so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did?it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true, otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have.	Some may believe that it's the unadulterated word of God, but looking at the above passage it's also easy to believe that it's also the work of common people.The rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line, and I believe I've shown that a reasonable person might not, so I'm going to skip to your next paragraph.
0	The majority of criminals don't want to deal with trouble. Most aren't looking for a shootout where there's a risk of them getting shot at and most don't even want to shoot period. Most are just looking for the free stuff they can get or in cases of rape they're definately not looking to fight an armed victim. It has been shown that criminals are less likely to break into a house whose owner has a gun.	More likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance.There is no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand-gun
1	I think that might mean that you should shut your trap about other people and not pass judgement on them (i.e. Carl Sagan right here in this topic, etc.). What do you think?	Romans 2:11You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
1	If by "We the People" you mean a handful of self appointed persons with strong financial intrest in the running of the country...   The document is largely a copy of the theories of Montesqieu and John Locke.	At the risk of becoming embroiled in a seemingly heated exchange, I think I might interject with a little history....To answer Smiley's question: “who wrote the constitution?” I would say the answer is found in the preamble to the document: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” (bold emphasis added)
0	I don't that it's selfish so much as self-interested. There is a difference. Most people want to live a long life. Is this selfish? The idea of an after life is merely an extension of this same idea.Why do you think belief in an afterlife leads to contempt for society?	I am inclined to believe that the desperation of one to "exist forever" is a very selfish conceit and leads to contempt for the rest of society.
0	The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong?

1	Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.	so if that satisfies everyone's dues then this is done with.
0	maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points.	Again show me something other than an opinion.
1	That is a completely subjective assessment. Thelmoose and Unkerpaulie were already quick to dissociate themselves from any smugness or self righteousness on this very thread.   It's a schism!

0	I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures, such as the literal reading of Genesis (which was never meant to be literal to begin with, but that is a different matter).It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people.However, when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe, science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being.	1) Science has disproven the young-earth Creationists' God.
0	really? wow! my parents did the same thing! we had a water-cooler bottle that my dad put change into for years, and when we were little kids we went to cash it in, all of us helping to roll the hundreds of pounds of coins, and it ended up being worth over $900! ever since then, i've been a coin fanatic. people are so quick to throw away change. my friends know that i'll always take a nickel or a few pennies if they don't want to carry them around.	anyway, my sister and i took them in... about $1000 but now we don't have any coins.
1	It's only obvious to the delusional ones, as I did not lift it from anyone. Just stating the truth. If it hurts, tough.	(And by the way, don't think it's not all-too-obvious that you lifted the "credibility" line from Thelmoose's comments to Jim.)
1	are you clear as to what you are questioning here? or just kicking up dust? sounds like a are you still beating your live in lover type of question from the gunners seat.	would a prosecution for shooting an intruder in the states demonstrate the illegality of using a gun for self-defense in america?

"OK, just for you, one more time, now concentrate like a laser beam...."Irrelevant to the issue of same sex marriage.
0	So have you found figures pertaining to the rate of mountain growth? It is not enough to see with the naked eye the way erosion is. This explanation would also cause some mountains to fall as tectonic plates move away from eachother. Again after billions of years all rivers in existence would be deeper than those in the grand canyon without the material coming down from mountains.	This is know and quantifiable given that all branches of sciences and all current forms of dating back it up.

0	Now you are confusing me. In a previous post, you wrote this: "A gay couple has no more right to marry then two brothers"But now you say that you never said there "is no right to same sex marriage." So are you arguing that two brothers do have the right to marry? I am reading your posts, but you seem to make contradictory arguments. That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway. It sounded like a nuanced argument to me. But apparently that is not what you were saying? Can you clarify this?Thanks.	I did not say there is no right to same sex marriage and I did not say that same sex marriages should be illegal...I thought that you read my posts..you obviously do not......

If you or the others are bothered by his ignorant banter please let me know, and I will stop forcing him to give answers on subjects that he so obviously has no clue.	Just trying to read through a page of this, it seems disjointed at best.
1	oh hun i am sorry, i'll get right on that :) but yes i retouched her scars, she's a cutter for sure...	for work of course, not for my birthday present.
1	We are figments of our own imaginations, sent here by Satan to annoy the faithful! emoticonXAngel	I guess people who think homosexuality is "just a behavior" must think celibate homosexuals don't exist.
1	Er . . . how do you know that god hasn't told anyone to kill enmasse (in the last 2000 years)? Does he run all his orders by you?	I am humble enough and introspective enough to look at my own past, recognize my own human frailties, nature and shortcoming and humble myself before His perfect wisdom and knowledge to see clearly that which isn't clear to me at the time.Also, just to clarify, God hasn't told me or anyone else to kill anyone enmasse in 2000 years since the advent of the Age of Grace which Jesus, our Messiah ushered in.
0	Just like the Brady Campaign. Often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals, most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with, or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens-rea and weren't crimes to begin with.	Those given to emotional rhetoric don't mind one bit if it suits their agenda.
0	Among other things, generally adaptions to a colder environment.    As for your theory as a whole, doesn't the whole 15, 000 year gap between the extinction of the Neanderthalls and the development of farming (particularly the grains youre talking about).	There are quite a lot of other differences between modern human and neaderthals other than just 'brain size'.Well, right... neanderthals were short and stocky and big-boned...
1	are you retarded or just ignorant? either way, get your facts right. limbaugh and savage do not have tv shows so if they want to listen to beck they still can on the radio. second, you imply fox fired beck...umm, no. third, the glenn beck program was the third most watched cable news program between two other fox news programs.  i'm not a fan of the glenn beck tv program but at least i'm not going around making stuff up.	his listeners will have to go to limbaugh, savage or some other purveyors of tea party issues.
1	the ones that make you stupid. you are so passionate about this thing that your judgment is impaired. i am kind surprised that you let your emotions influence your quest for truth. atlas shrugged is as dangerous as the bible and people like you are as bad as religious fundamentalists.	i am there... sorta, but i want to debate not talk about how much i agree with someone :p you know... it was exactly the kind of situation someone like you belongs in.
1	Yes, it doesn't agree with your agenda so it must be trolling.	This post is IMO borderline trolling...
1	Of course you don't. It's the natural humanistic way of thinking.	that's right, i don't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.
1	Wow, that must be some good stuff he was drinking to keep him 'under the influence' for THAT long!! :p	Whether or not this affected his thinking is a question which should to be considered when asking questions about mormon theology.
0	if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?	people have been warning for the last 30 years that deindustrialisation is a really bad idea, and that loading up massive amounts of personal and public debt is an even worse idea.
1	Society highly values the creation of future taxpayers, especially under deficit-spending socialist presidents. :p	Cause frankly I fail to see the benefit of your marriage to me or anyone else outside of your family at all.
1	Yes, mulitculturalism is wonderful. You know what else is wonderful? Fact checking:Archie swallows own foot againIt was the second link when I googled his name. At least try to not look like a jackass every time you post.	Many said that Alghabra’s key supporter, councilor and Liberal party member Khalid Usman who came from Markham, took the podium with Alghabra, announcing, "We have the East, we have the West, and now we have Mississauga!"
0	is this what jpsartre meant? at any rate, to say that there were large numbers of gay men, being infected in the u.s., is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself. there is a connection when there is active sexuality, gay or straight, and aids is a sexually transmitted disease. we actually don't know who patient zero was. what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men, and fewer heterosexuals, to the best of our available knowledge? this is a disease, and unknowingly spreading it, no matter who you are, is not murder. the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group, who had sex among that group, before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it; that would also not be murder.	becuase the thread is primarily focused on the initial outbreak and spread of aids in the us, and to say there is no connection between that outbreak and spread and sexuality either demonstrated that you are either completely and totally ignorant of the facts, or you have utterly blinded yourself in the name of political correctness.
0	But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.	...if we see relatively few creationists on these boards, all that means is, theres relatively few creationists on these boards.
1	I think pedophilia is a disorder as opposed to an illness but I'd have to look back at some psychology books. How do I define illness? Well, I have a few contexts for this. The flu...obvious illness. Christians feel that sin is an "illness", so in that sense we are all rather ill :). As for wrong...same deal.	Well, I define illness based upon the way medical professionals define illness, in which case, homosexuality is NOT an illness, and pedophilia is.Upon what criteria do you define illness?Upon what criteria do you judge them as wrong?
1	why? that doesn't make alot of sense. we say gas go over $2 during a period of relatively low demand. why would gas stabalize that a price that is lower then what it was during a period of low demand when high demand is projected with increases consumption in china the us and the industralized world as a whole? oh yes, i'm asking the person who thinks that cds are good investments during periods of low inflation. emoticonxrolleyes	this is grat news..............so much for the gloom and doomers........i think you will continue to see prices fall and the price of gasoline will stabalize at about $1.85 a gallon.................. the reason why gasoline is so expensive in other countries,especially in europe is because they have huge taxes built into the price..........
0	Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles.	If the intent behind the Chicago handgun ban is truly racist then why allow blacks to own rifles?
1	Then what's Mississippi's problem? They must be run by a-holes because they are being forgotten.	Perhaps his problem was not being able to deal with LA a-holes?
1	Well that lets out most of the supreme court when RvW comes up! And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote. Perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea!	I see that many of you are busily discussing angels on the head of a pin questions.My view is that no man ought to have any opinion whatsoever on a woman's decision of whether or not to terminate a pregnancy unless and until she asks him.
0	that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?	that is something i'd rather not do and i am forced to.
0	Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood. And it goes way the heck beyond speculation. Check out how homeobox genes work and how regulation by master switches is understood as just two examples.	On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as “temperature and embryonic diet” might cause proteins to fold differently and thus “whip up” complex systems such as “eyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shells”
1	Yeah, lets tax those rich greedy jerks!!! I mean really, why be equal when you want something for free right??? SCREW FREEDOM I WANT MY HEALTHCARE!!!	You get what you pay for in this regard.
0	based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not.	see... http://www.catholic.net/rcc/loveboth/chapter27.html http://www.factcheck.org/article336.html the number of illegal abortions is also overstated...some estimate it is only around 100,000...considering 1973 only had around 800,000 abortions it doen't seem likely that a year before 1million were done illegally.
1	And so goes the fact you're more than willing to let rapists and murderers go free.	There you go again, conflating questioning with disobeying.Da*n right you should question the cop who pulls you over.
1	But AA's not responsible for that, because he is an A-rab.	He also forgets that an estimated 20 million native americans were killed by smalpox introduced by europeans, or "Joe Christian" as JP puts it
0	Form 4473, question 11a reads as follows:11.a. Are you the actual buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.	Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.
1	And you can be described as a "pre-dead corpse" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???	Baby can be used to describe a human fetus.
1	Your signal to noise ratio was too low for my tastes: too much "wackiness" (I assume "wackiness" was what you were trying for) and irrelevant side discussions.	This is a PIE adapter that goes into the factory AUX/CD changer controls....Listen to one and you will hate the cassette thingy,,,,
1	pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ?   your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.  My advice to you ?  keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.	my age is irrelevant to the fact that i simply know more than you can comprehend.
1	Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.	So we advise against relying on any ‘evidence' he provides, unless supported by creationist organisations with reputations for Biblical and scientific rigour.
1	I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?	You'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent, before I'd agree that they are as bad as you imply, but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes.
1	and yet you ignored the specific link mentioning the current regs while asking for it at the same time.  no, i dislike your techniches because they are unethical, hold double standards, and aren't based on facts.  oh yes, who was the one who asked for the reg link while ignoring it at the same time?  the fact that you quote newsmax says much about how much credence anyone here gives you.	you come up with more unrelated **** than anyone else on this board.
1	So, I guess in your view, educating people against prejudice and intolerance is a bad thing.	I'm sure you're right, but then again, they are also disageeing with countless other people on that point as well.
1	jos 24:15? what book of the bible is that? i thought i knew the names of all the books of the bible used by protestants but i don't recognize jos.	jos 24:15 'if it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the lord, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the river, or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the lord.'
0	could you see language evolving in non social animals? it wouldnt have a reason to.	why would intelligence not evolve in animals that do not have complex social behavior patterns?
1	I guess we all missed your point Justine, whatever it might have been. emoticonXConfused Better luck next time. emoticonXGood	Obviously you missed the point.
0	Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age. What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is? What is the importance of knowing if somebody's white, black or mexican when they're buying a gun?	A more logical explanation is that there may have been racist gun laws during a certain time period but gun control isn't inherently racist.
0	End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.	and you consider it drivel because?the amendement reads:A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
1	Senior citizen yachties stand little chance of defending themselves against pirates.   Piracy needs to be dealt with using military might.	So why should merchant ships be required to go unarmed and defenseless in dangerous areas?
0	If Congress decides to remove the law, what can the military do?Nothing.Logically, they're not a barrier...	...and how military personnel are no barrier to repealing gay exclusion rules, its good for a laugh.
1	** This is the best response you've got!?! What a loser!!	What couints is the functioning of the system as a whole.
0	This is a separate issue, Voice of Reason. Some didn't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally wouldn't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other's right to do it, and that's what I was answering.	The fact you always ignore is your not just doing it to your body.....
1	He didn't pursue the "master race of white Protestant." He was a pure Aryanist, genius one. The very least you could do is get your facts straight, but you probably like spreading this bullcrap on purpose. (Seeing as how you're an atheist.)	why did hitler pursue the master race of white protestant...
1	I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.	the formation or expression of an opinion or theory without sufficient evidence for proof.
0	Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child? Not likely. I think she will still suffer through those thoughts. Killing the baby complicates this. What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion?	The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis....
0	why didn't you think of it? it took me no time at all to find the actual article, who authored it, and how to contact them. from what i have seen of your post, you rarely think at all.	when he responds i may email him myself :)
0	i love how every line, except number 3, has a winking emoticon at the end. haha	oh well, at least i met my 50 character limit.
1	Yeah, there are quite a number of dumb Republican bureacrats running Califorhia.	Correct but its California where common sense is dead and bureaucrats rule supreme.
0	But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government.	Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me.
1	It's also a noun. But since you're unable but to repeat your self, maybe a few more times will make it 'true'	If you take a fish from the arctic seas, and put it in some chilled water (say, 5 degrees celcius) then that fish is going to think it is very hot, despite the fact we would call the water cold.
0	i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a "possibility of existence". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: "greatest possible being". the "greatest possible being", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole "proof" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as "the greatest being possible". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled	Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.
1	As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.	As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off.
1	Damn, takes some real gonads (wait, you're a Lib, so scratch THAT one) to claim the power to get inside the minds and hearts of the masses...a protest by Conservatives MUST be racist, but a protest by Libs is pure and righteous, correct?	Even Fox News puts the attendance in five digits, yet FW tries to pretend they are much larger.2) Pretend a uniformity of presence behind a rational banner, when the truth is that a LARGE segment of attendance sits behind a looney banner (like calling the president racist or Kenyan or secret Muslim or fascist / socialist / communist / nazi).THAT is my point.Or an even more popular one?The strawman argument!
1	What is it that you disagree with? My statement of fact? Or the fact that I made a politically incorrect assertion? emoticonXConfused	Jake, while I don't agree with JP that this should be an issue of blame, with all due respect, your point here is a bit disingenuous--smallpox isn't easily spread by engaging in a given behavior as HIV is--HIV is a sexually transmitted disease.
1	First off, your sick. To actually want to see more death and destruction.  Are Americans somehow less intelligent? Your notions are racist for lack of a better term. What to meet stupid? Walk out your front door and sample the people on the side walk. You'll find the same stupid around the world.	i hope they do bomb the us, but actually get the pentagon this time.
1	Funny. Foreigners are always cited when liberals talk about how great gun control is and how much good can come from it.	You're not even in the same hemisphere.
1	Apparently in Marc9000's small, small, small world, if you're not a Christian, you're a atheist.   Thus over 4 billion people are atheists. emoticonXAgree	It pretty much puts an end to the argument if you're an atheist.
0	Very sad news. I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery.	His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up.
1	That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.	OH, OH, OH.., How much you'd like to relegate your immorality to the devil.
1	So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?	Therefore, we can conclude that teaching evolution is not teaching knowledge nor science, and as such, is teaching ignorance (defined as lack of knowledge).
1	I won't hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you've composed. Guess we'll chalk it up to puffery.	What he doesn't want you to know is the depth of lawlesness and infringement is already in effect and is only working to punish innocent people and has nothing to do with crime control...it is all about ultimate disarmament and loss of Second Amendment rights.
1	And the Brady background check has not been repealed either so by your "logic" it must be effective.	There's been no mass adoption of these laws by various states across the country, and there's even been cases of them being repealed due to ineffectiveness.If gun control laws worked at controlling crime, and the presence of firearms actually had the potential to increase crime rates, these facts would be reversed.
1	so, global warming no, but weather control devices, yes? perhaps too many people are playing red alert these days...	as long as catagory 5 hurricans have been happening, it doesn't make sence that catagory 5s are created by a cold war device.
0	were they assigned the ultimate task of interpreting the constitution and determining which laws violate it? if not then their opinion doesn't matter.	even with the supreme court ruling, sinjin and chet have said otherwise... on the day this was posted!
1	so, you admit defeat to a child? you have no argument and can only name call. answer my posts with something other than ad hominem or admit defeat.	if you have no answer to #64, please just concede.
1	So if it was deemed by 'those with the knowledge that give their opinion weight' that a fetus can feel pain and stress during a termination you would agree that the termination should not be carried out..well done	Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight...
1	Really? Well, when I have a kid, I'll be sure to just leave it in the woods, since it can apparently care for itself.	The key issue is that once children are born they are not physically dependent on a particular individual.
1	Balderdash! Atheism isn't science. That's nonsense. And science is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is.	Atheism, (thinly disguised as science) creates the hypothesis that there is no God, and works backwords [sic] to find evidence for only that hypothesis.
1	ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked. 'but of course.' he replied and with that...*poof* he was gone. that explains why he doesn't do anything. no miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...he's gone. and, for those fools who doubt this, i refer you to the book of job. witness how god jumps to the tune of satan when god withdraws his protection from his loyal and faithful servant...merely to prove a point to satan...without cause!	god can do anything.
0	You could've just as easily revived the last thread, commenting on how the antis are unusually silent.	At least Ian responded in a friendly way, and me and him don't even agree on this issue.
1	So, Steeeeve, I take it you are not for a FAIR society?   Is an unfair society a moral society? Please explain. I find it difficult to comprehend.	yes i believe in strict government regulation of business.
0	This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do.	What parts of the Bible are true, and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true?
0	Of course not. That battle has already been lost. Creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class, even when it is called "creation science" and the data is distorted and mininterpreted. The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board (and yes, they were YECs) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution, and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards.	I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase "Young Earth Creationists" in any official capacity, nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught.
1	So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders.	They just make people want to kill.
0	I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think thatthe terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not awareof any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris.	I thought at issue was simply the impossibility of determing precise data.
0	that explains it, post 60, page 4. look what comes up for me. i have my forums settings at 40 posts per page. post 121 which came up was the first post at the top of the page.  regarding ip's, the region/part of the country or world they are from can be determined, so i'll make you an additional offer; if he shows that both easyrider and my ip's are located in the same town in nh, i'll still agree to being banned. i say this not knowing where rider is from but i assume he doesn't live in my state.	either you didn't take a look at the link, or you did and your browser didn't take you to the bottom of the page ad you were too lazy to look for the post.
1	if you can find an impartial judge, i'll take you up.	I will take the position that they should not.
0	And you will cowardly ignore the validity of the difference, as you whine that there is one ...A person goes to the doctor, that information is NOT public information. A doctor / patient can claim doctor/patient confidentiality. It's a recognized and valid situation.But with the "knowthyneighbor", these polls are PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. The purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud.If you weren't so intent on trying to bash, you would recognize the obvious distinctions... emoticonXRolleyes	Now you will come up with some lame excuse for a difference between the two but in the end both are bad ways to deal with the issue.
0	But it's not detecting any "new" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye, but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver.	If a telescope can see a new color, how can we observe the information?
0	That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your "apple falling" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple.	The equivalent of ID is doing all the experiments with the apple, measuring the mass of the apple and the Earth, and figuring out gravity, publishing it, and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments, with no refutations or flaws, and then some people coming along and saying, "well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does, ever think of that?
0	Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.	which kills the women.it is not child birth that kills those women.it is an attempt to abort.if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died.Having a child, is not a trajedy... its just part of life.its not a wrongful burden... or a flaw of existance.. its nature.dah... do you even read what is being posted?-Mosheh Thezion
0	oh yeah i said that because what he said was a sweeping statement and i was just pointing out what he posted is not always the case.	i responded to you because you said 'i beg to differ'.
0	I hope I have already begun to change your mind.	I want to see the evidence.
1	Sheesh ! What a way to bring goodwill to all people in the world, "yearning" for democracy. And if I remember right Saddam was our toady during the first Reagan Administration. Hmmmmmm, wasn't George Herbert Walker Bu$h our Veep then ?	I got the number from the Documental Centre for Human Rights in Iraq, although I did some research on them and they are affiliated with the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, so they're not exactly Saddam friendly.Human Rights Watch puts the number at 290.000 deaths.The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
1	The fact that you think the 9-9-9 plan is good only proves you are as stupid as Herman Cain is. Maybe you and Grover Norquist can get with Herman Cain and start construction on Utopian dreamworld, and don't forget to stop by and pick up your other dumbass Ron Paul on your way .	If you pay attention to the papers or news you will have a heavy air of stupidity around you.
0	so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?	if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy works as long as you do it in the presence of gravity, but that smacks of a circular definition to me.
0	Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.	it may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if i have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, i will have to delete this first half and move it to the end.
0	Yes, it is, and I'll gladly excuse his grammar compared to my zero ability in Hungarian.	Seriously, is English your second language?
1	i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around.	you are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they aren't connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms.
1	that is an utter contradiction. he knows what is going to happen, but wants to preserve our freedom of choice? what freedom? please, explain so i can understand, this 'freedom' which gives rise to only one possible future! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny. no ifs, buts or maybes. this isn't about god deciding our future, it's about whether we can. well, that's one interpretation. another would be 'not sticking our heads in the sand'.	it basically means that god knows what's going to happen before it happens.
1	You know my answer: There is no god and no one "created" mankind. But the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under "Religious" or "Philosophy" section, not abortion.   Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?	You didn't mind commenting about God ('the Lord's prophets') just before I wrote my question above to you, so why are you running scared or bugging out now?Looks to me like you couldn't answer the question.
0	Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, "Turkana Boy" It is also sometimes called "Nariokotome Boy". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil.	I gave you the name and a thumbnail...if you aren't bright enough to go look at a bigger picture than I can't help you.
0	no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe.	if this were the case than non-humans that are biological alive should also have the right to life.
1	Yeah, cause there are sooo many 100 year old corks just kickin around.	The point is, how old the wine is, not the cork.
0	You said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. How is that a misinterpretation?   You're asking for proof of a negative. How many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? We don't know...   Erm.... You're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly. I'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class.	what i'm advocating is that we stop this naive belief that we can save lives by banning guns on and around school property, because the victims of columbine and virginia tech will tell you that this belief is wrong.

0	I didn't answer or you didn't understand? Actually I did answer. The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it. The skull, even though I gave it very ape-like features, is from a biped. There are many examples of what I described.	"Outside of a nutshell, you still didn't answer the question.
1	i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel	to me that makes sense as well, but i just wanted to clear up what it was saying.
1	what country are you from? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law. the legislature writes it, the executive approves it, and the judiciary interprets it. the people have no direct say what so ever.	its because if you want to change law you shouldn't be able to exploit the judiciary..you need to do it like everyone else has (up until 50yrs ago) which is go convince the people and run it like a democracy.
1	Not quite sure what you are talking about, Iangb. And I really don't have time to crack the code so if you have a specific question, just ask it already.	Hey, does this mean you've found a definition for 'life' that you like yet?

1	Why would I worry about a book of myths and fairy tales?	You will all have to bow down and confess Jesus is Lord once you meet him at the Judgment.Recommend you read Romans chapter 3.
1	So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized "Good morning, sweetie", that would be an answer?	You did not ask for a quote which says "we should ban guns" and you posed the question TO "anti-gunners" you did not ask for anti-gun comments.
1	Whose culture are we talking about, here?I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?	That "one iota" we're discussing is a major change: part of the very heart of what marriage is.
0	Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two.	You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.
0	So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant.	If they don't believe in what they're selling, why should I.
0	And where exactly did you hear this? I find it hard to believe a governent that couldn't keep an affair or a low-level break-in under wraps could keep something like that secret.................

1	Say hello to my little friend! We the people, through our State Governments!	Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox today threw his support behind the National Rifle Association's challenge of a City of Chicago ordinance banning possession of most handguns by filing a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court.Cox's amicus brief -- a document filed in court by someone not directly related to a case -- supports the request by the NRA to the Supreme Court for an appeal of the U.S.
0	as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'.	surely, then you are not saying that whole structures such as feet formed complete...that would be a contradiction now wouldn't it.....so answer my question: what about the feet?
1	making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists, with no real knowledge of their situation? archie has no problem. but when it comes to christianity, the obfuscational ploy of 'i don't know all the details' comes out, followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details. she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so. the bible lays out exclusive reasons for 'divorce'. this isn't one of them. this is yet another example of religious intolerance, even to the extent of violating their own religion.	well i was going from the guardian article which was rather more in depth on the specifics.
1	Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone?

Well, since the government passed the gun control laws that gun hater pilot wanted the government should be held responsible. That means the tax payer will pay for gun haters pilot gun free bs!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones at columbine can freely walk around and kill their victims!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones on 9/11 that used box cutters to take over airplanes crowed with people!	Or is that just your style, to avoid any questions that might make you think, keep twisting everyones words around, calling them gun haters and racists, and making yourself sound like a total XXX?
0	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.	Surely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism.

1	Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?	The truth is that all the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare.
0	Besides the hundreds of cases in which such things are directly observed, I guess you're right.	This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist.

0	pay attention. age of consent is still the topic and point. if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five-decimal point factor, that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good/bad societal interpretation designated by non-teens, would it not? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non-status unless those non-teens making the laws had another agenda.	is the question will education and contraception help reduce teen pregnancy?

1	Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers).	It is possible you had the title of Christian without the relationship which gives you this title.
1	What's that? Campaigning and use of taxpayer funded facilities like transportation for political purposes? I suppose they paid the cops for going out of their jurisdiction too?	Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda, and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value, but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that.
0	Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent. You said this:	Why must we make more assumptions based on what will happen in the next 10,000 years?

0	Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.	Why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when I offer my vote/opinion, I am imposing something evil on you?

IF he is writing as Lurch, and someone else comes onto a board, as Ungerdunn, who is just as rude (which is what you are saying), you assume it's the same person? Or, is it because they both claim to be biologists? I guess that having another person enter a forum, and claim to be a biologist would narrow it down to just the same person emoticonXClown All you've done is said you know it is him because one writer is as rude as the other... and that this gives his identity away by some mysterious process, probably I don't understand this as I've never read set-theory! emoticonXWow What should be a very easy question becomes you repeating "I know it is him".Also, has he been banned as Lurch on these other fora?

1	Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. Quick search reveals NO mentions at all. Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical.	And, whether it supports my POV, as I believe it does, is not the point.

1	Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.	If they had wings, they may be blown into the ocean and drown.
1	Even then, your statement does nothing. They aren't "getting themselves pregnant". A doctor is doing a medical procedure, that may or may not result in a pregnancy (ya know, those little sperm thingies?) emoticonXAngel	The number of people that do this is irrelevant, alls that counts is the very fact that it happens, and so it invalidates the the sweeping statement that suggested otherwise.
0	What are you talking about? Please define information. What does "new" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism.	Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information.
1	No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word "prayer?" Why not?

1	point me toward the right way then? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs. please tell us how creationists were wrong. i would gladly like to see you try!	Look at pretty much any post on this forum and you will see this.
1	Yawn, again you keep repeating this. You not only refute yourself by providing an example of knowledge of the unknowable, but you gave an example of what is unknowable, by telling me I'd never be able to know you!	You have claimed god is real, and unknowableTo claim knowledge of the unknowable is self-contradictory.

1	Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders.	In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders.

0	just a question, can someone show me where symbiote posted at all on the thread?  4forums.com political debates and polls - search results he's got 4 posts in the past day. none of which are about what cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08 says they are.  sorry giantorio for cluttering the forum. and thanks cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08, you just proved my point. when i prove you are wrong, you just change your argument and insult me for failing to prove your new argument you just created. you did this as yankee fan on lw. you did this here as cashburn. you're doing it again as roesgen08. same exact story.	- - one would think that someone (such as yourself) so concerned about people posting truthfully about other posters would do so in their own posts.........
1	I still haven't seen an adequate rebuttal to this. Why can't people marry themselves if they are in love with themselves?  I must have missed your response.	All they would need to say is "come on, everyone thought gay marriage would lead to the downfall of man, but it hasn't, and neither will legalized [insert marriage concept here]" Your argument is evidence of the gradual process you purport not to exist.
0	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.	Likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning.
1	oh no you didn't! not g earnst website?  oh yes you did! that would be like me quoting from nato's website.  po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie  potomac river humm.	perhaps you could clarify.
0	Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max.	I see far to many religious people that know absolutely nothing about the universe they live in as a result.
0	that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. were is the biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created. in fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. it is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat. pride caused the fall of the son of morning, not scientific discovery.	by the way how did lucifer become the devil??
0	The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.	why not?Life is cheap and I hold no silly notions.Science should be used to benefit life, not ignored.
0	Umm.. again they are identified as Messianic Jewish. Google 'Messianic Jewish' if you care, thousands of hits. So you now try to personally misidentify this 'Jewish' group on your own terms? A Messianic Jew is a Jewish person who believes that Yeshua (Jesus) is their Messiah. Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post. You seem to be inferring that I am suggesting that such 'change' means a change for ALL Jews, sic, obviously I am not suggesting that.	Can you tell me where in the New Testament it says that the Sabbath has to be done on Sunday?
0	In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use "his/her" or "he/she"... it just gets tiring after a while...)	Separating siamese twins where there is only one heart, allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area.
1	Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so "self-confident" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.	Do you think a blind man can make a watch?If you think he can I am not surprized that you think Mr. Dawkins has superb logic.
1	where did that happen, in your dreams? please note the word ' extreme'. extreme lefties have been just as blood thirsty as extreme righties.	then, we let all the remaining nutcases gather in their own corner so that they can babble amongst themselves.
0	Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible. I hardly consider a 1500 year old book "making clear what he wants". Particularly given that even among those who believe the book, they still can't agree on what God wants. And of course, that doesn't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible. You may personally believe that you know what God wants, but if so it's not because God has been clear about it.	I would say that if a diety can't go out of his way to demonstrate his existance and make clear what he wants This may surprise you, although we cannot observe not test this, God has come down to Earth many times throughout human history.
1	That's like looking at a rainbow and insisting it only has the color red in it.	See I view human sexuality as being the exclusive province of the monogamous heterosexual marriage bond.
1	then why have you attacked kerry and other democrats for voting aganist abortion bills that did not have such clauses?  oh yes, i know why, because you're a lying hypocrite.	i think it goes without saying that any time the mother's life is endangered then and abortion can take place............ as far as rape and incest if and abortion has to take place lets hope that it is before the last 3 months of the pregnancy........
0	d. adams? :)  this is, of course, an entire debate unto itself. i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere. but that it's probable? we simply don't have the data to make that leap. we've got some good theories about how life started here, but we don't know exactly what happened. and even if we did, we don't know how common those conditions are 'out there'. if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years, and for all we know they might be, than we may well be the only life in the universe. logically, we just can't say. we don't have enough info to apply logic to the problem.	space is really, really big, so big it bigger than you can think of big.
0	Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment.	The monks?
0	Depends on the usage. Generally, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population.	Does the term "evolution" refer to ONLY the "advances" of life over time?
0	You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt.	Common sense says that if we are all on a downhill slide that mutation/selection – being the conservative/degenerative devicees that they are -- could have never have explained the origin of anything.
0	I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood	My point wasn't to show that the unborn is a person but to show that the real question isn't "Who gets to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy, the woman herself or some nameless faceless bureaucrat?"
1	wow, there you go again. first we can cut health care costs by hiring lots and lots of doctors and nurses and building lots more hospitals... which have to be, you know, paid for. now we can cut postal rates by hiring lots and lots more delivery people! who have to be, you know, paid. in your view it seems that any cost can be reduced by spending more money... it's fascinating really.	ups and fedex would hire more people where they would be able to cover the vast plains of the united states.
0	This is the most asinine argument yet. The man was making six figures as a radio talk show host. Why would he leave that job to hit the road for 18 hour days away from family merely in the hopes of hawking a few extra books? He had an ESTABLISHED platform to sell boks viz a viz his radio show, his frequent substitutions on other programs, and his status as a darling of the Tea Party. The man could line up paid speaking engagements to hawk his book. Why would he trade that for unpaid speaking engagements to hawk his book?	und the country using those talking points without any actual knowledge of what he's even talking about, and when confronted with the reality that he knows less than a rock about any given subject... well that's just stupid.
1	You would say that, because you are neither a woman, nor gay. Families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist by the way, and women and children had few rights. The family structure was "secure" that way. Yes, the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage, is just such a good thing in and of itself. This meant fewer people burning in hell, which is what is really important.emoticonXRolleyes	I wouldn't want to go back to that time, but it definitely had it's pluses.
0	Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.	It has been addressed several times on this forum and the best evidence available shows that effect B is greater than C.
0	In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic "mutation" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained.	If this mutation is random doesn't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as, in the long run, only the offspring of the mutated species would survive?
1	I think you're VERY mistaken.I'm not a republican. Nor a democrat.Never been registered as anything other than 'independent'.I'm such because I think.Unlike a party parrot that you seem to be yourself.Since I'm neither...who the hell can "I" be in the minority?Must be your biggoted knee-jerk reaction to think that anyone who doesn't think like you and slurp the Flavor Aid is the opposition and as such must be in the 'enemy party'.And you are a hater because you verbiage is hate filled, caustic and ever insulting. And not in a funny, jestful way but full of vitriol and bile.	You do a good job of regurgitating all the Reichwing talking points.
0	One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies.	is it that creationists are making assertions without understanding what they are talking about?
1	I would argue against this but I would need to introduce subjectivism into the argument. lolemoticonXCensored	It's the principle, not whether the organism is sentient at that exact moment, but whether it as a category (species) is sentient.A sleeping person doesn't lose their rights because they can't pass the mirror test unconscious.
1	Are you kidding me?! You think that blacks living in Third World Carribean and African countries are "content?!" They're starving by the tens of thousands per day or living so far below the poverty level that it's unimaginable. Maybe you should wander off the beach sometime and see for yourself.	yes criminals existed, but not in the rampant way we see today.
1	But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?	In Genesis, humans are created seperately from all other creatures, but apes and monkeys are not specifically mentioned.
0	You can do so, and if I don't check your source I guess I'm SOL, eh? I've seen the story many places, but this is beyond simply a site dedicated to outing Bush since its a radio show :P	All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past.
0	They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?	I see no duplicity between the two.
1	Functioning? The fetus breathes freely? It cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable? It demands attention? It smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it?  Wow! Didn't know that fetuses were that active and functional.	but that only makes sense when the womb is empty.
1	funny how all those previously plentiful miracles, burning bushes, and personal appearances dropped off so suddenly 2000+ years ago... innit? enquiring minds want to know. non-enquiring minds don't want to enquire.	i mean i'm not asking for anything more than a personal appearance.
0	Well you don't need to doubt it. I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need.	Granted these are all not necessarily plausible, but never-the-less they are just as plaussible that the dog was subject to a random bout of evolution.Further, you said..."Just to show what my personal feelings are on God, if I seen him appear in the sky right now and waved at me, I'd drop all my previous ideas and accept that he exists without hesitation.
1	And you offer none for your's. Heteros engage is risky business as well. Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage.   It's not just STD's, it's all sorts of physical issues as well. Cancers, hepatitus, bacterial infections, that result from anal and vagina sex. Add one word and BAM, it works aganist you.	Thats what I thought..... no defense for your perverse behavior.
0	Very well said. However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected. That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights. However, safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense.	It worked just fine for the first half of the 20th century.And training should never be a requirement for exercising a constitutional right.
1	Don't get your panties in a wad, 38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control this clown can dream up.	The Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer of the nation, is "the enemy", but this is not paranoia.
0	How do we know anything for sure? We can't be certain of the Earth's age in billions of years, but we can use carbon dating to figure out it's older then 55,000 years, which refutes creationism.	#4 - How do we know without a doubt the world is billions of years old?
0	Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us.	Global warming may or may not be the result of what humans are doing, although it sure isn't helped by our destorying the environment.
0	...i usually go to the one on morena. and heres why i'm telling you: it's a big ass world out there and you don't know what i look like. also, it's a fantastic costco and i'm proud to shop there.	btw, which costco do you go to ;)
0	You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?And to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?Smiley	What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death.
1	You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts.	I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime.
0	So what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions.	Either way, the theory of evolution can explain the DNA change with fewer assumptions.
0	You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience. A discussion about the various methods (and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html	If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest.
0	I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.	Removal of body parts by whatever means does not change the dna of the rest of the body.
0	Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is "treating them as breeding animals". Kind of an odd thought.	No, it doesn't make it right but it's not right to treat women as breeding animals either.
0	Our side? I don't get the impression we're on the same side.Besides, I think the subject is decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies.	Yeah if we could get a good portion of the pro-life people on our side we might stand a pretty good chance of significantly decreasing the amount of abortions.
1	Wow, what a group of rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error. I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are. That's why the bible say's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God.	In terms of our lives, that's not important.It amazes me just how dumb creationists are.
0	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.  In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work.	S Africa has the most restrictive gun laws on the planet.
1	O.K. lets' play your game. Gun control has worked exactly WHERE?	I agree with this but you have to remember what works in one place may not work in another and visa versa.
0	No, the question is why you let violent individuals remain free in public.	The key question is, really, whether guns make violent events more lethal.
1	Oh, it gave me quite a shock when that happened! I wasn't expecting it at all! emoticonXRolleyes	Tell me Dzeron, are you at all suprised when provided the means to prove his claim, VOR fails horribly?
1	Oh, so this only happens here, huh? Every single hardcore drug addict is here, huh?	Not a coincidence, just a stupid population to look at to understand whether marijuana does or does not lead to "harder" drugs.
0	Because Humphreys went out looking? How many should we allegedly find?	There are not enough stone-age skeletons ...
1	The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.	It doesn't agree with the study done by the Violence Policy Center.
0	Yes California is following European socialism. Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes.	You need look no further than the current state of California to realized that the United States is heading towards socialism just as Europe has in the past few decades.
0	Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers.	Losing a fetus should not be a big deal to the pro choice lot on this forum, considering the effort they put into arguing that a fetus is either the equivalent of a parasite or a piece of tissue with no value .
1	Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure.	He was arrested and spent several hours in a cell when plainly he had not broken any laws.
0	prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator.	when have liberals ever been upset and outraged over a criminal being given a deal?
0	that's fantastic! i say you go for it, and... um... pics or it didn't happen.	i think he's nuts!
0	Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.	variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation.
1	Sure you don't want to address the gaping holes in your argument. That's up to you.	All right, I'm not going to bother picking this apart line-by-line every day....
0	oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free-will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise. there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it. but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free-will i have not bothered to collect it. humans do not have free-will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of.	regardless you still put forth a premse in your rebuttal which is not subject to either proof or disproof.
0	[quote=mae] land that didn't belong to the un or israel. or current american aggression? what's the difference? both are imposing their ideologies by force. you make it sound like choosing a sports team; for or against based on personal opinion.	[quote=georged] 1) crucial difference is that the un gave israel a piece of land in the middle east.... not so for china in tibet.
0	rrriiigggghhhtttt.... do you really think your opposition to ending medicare / medicaid would just come from the recipients? no. it's like kids being afraid of getting their haircut. it's much adieu over nothing. and then when the haircut is done, they realize it's not as bad as they made it out to be... and they eventually recognize the need for the haircut...	anybody honest enough to denounce our socialist leaning predecessors in congress and the whitehouse could never get enough financial support from those that suckle off the gov't teat calling themselves 'democrats' of all things.
1	But if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. You are a rightwing hypocrite, Archie Baby.	It should also be noted that according to the Mass Constitution, the people have always voted on such issues.
1	Well, I guess this all just proves that more brain dead crack babies are surviving than I originally thought.	I think I should move to another country.
0	this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional.	scotus could rule that ffca isn't applicable because it is a license issue and not a statute.
1	Is this another attempt of yours to paint all that believe in smaller, less-intrusive government as loonies? Very transparent, sorry. :(	Your anger isolates you.Your vitriol isolates you.And furthermore, to quote Mr Williams..."Until he embraces the whole country what else can I conclude"Bush catered to the Republican extreme minority on a variety of issues.Where the heck was this talk then??
1	wow, good response. you know, attacking foul language instead of making a proper rebuttal makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.	throwing out the f bomb doesn't lend you any weight; it just makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.
0	It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.	On the subject of analogies for genetic information, would "computer language" (code) be a better analogy?Indeed mutation and evolution *could* be shown with computer viruses.Of course this would require some familiarity with computer code.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language
1	To summarize, since penfolds reasoning has been shown to be both ignorant and short sighted, his only recourse is to offer a trollish quip before skulking away like the irrational philosophical coward that he is. At least you're consistent penfold. emoticonXRolleyes	I defer to your greater personal knowledge of the depths of ignorance.
0	Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. "judicial fiat" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals.	But that of course is the fear that many have, i.e., that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat (whether at the state or federal level) rather than through legislative means.
1	wow many false gods beat an actual one. christinity may only believe in one god, the god.	they could easily defeat the father, the son, and the holy ghost.
0	Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual. What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for "walking in a mile in another's shoes". Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?	I do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother's life is in danger, otherwise they should live with it.
1	And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing. Science should teach currently held theory.	While most of the commonly held conjecture certainly fits the evidence at hand, there may be other explanations, explanations we have not even thought of yet, that also fit the evidence.
1	So says a ghoul who delights in digging up the body of a dead man.	You do realize that the man that Brown is replacing was a drunk that killed a young woman, went home to sleep it off and THEN reported it to police 8 hours later, right?By Kennedy standards, almost anybody is a step up the moral ladder.
0	yeah horses are so cute i love it when they eat sugar right out of my hands it's so tickly	horses are my favorite animal.
0	You benefit from all of these. They may not be direct benefits or even benefits you want but when it exists we all benefit. Frankly, the IRS is just an idiotic one. Your whole argument only works if you have the IRS to enforce these policies. Could we go without SS and Public education? Probably, but I prefer a system where society decides on what is a "public good" and we go with that.	Social security, IRS, EPA, the public school system are at the top of my list.
1	I'm not a "TROLL" unless of course disagreeing or believing differently from you makes me one. If so then I wear the title with pride.	If they are not trolls, then ignoring them may give them the time to focus and actually respond to some of the posts in an intelligent manner.
0	this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic	God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature.
1	Whatever. emoticonXRolleyes I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here, but that's up to you.	I think part of the problem is that you don't need to "explain" that to me at all.THAT is my point.You consistently criticize the gay side for not acknowledging that it's their "belief", but you are repeatedly "not addressing" their side regarding the ACCURACY of their belief.
1	And Anarchy. Am I allowed to kill someone if I feel like it ?	Voting isn't a third way, it is the rule of the majority by virtue of their posession of the greatest force.It is where voting does not decide, but where individuals are allowed to decide for themselves, that there is freedom and justice.
1	Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions?   Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?	Can you guarantee that what appears to be a simple mugging will come to an immediate halt once the mugger is complied with, and that he won't push for more than mere material goods?
0	So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?

0	I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. "Evolutionism" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?	the notion that the bible is completely and uncompromisingly true is paramount to christianity.with all that in consideration, it should be no surprise that christians will do everything possible to show evolution as false
1	And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be.

0	Marriage is a secular condition set up by various Societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders.Religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it.You don't curse the Church you lobby Society to see if you can effect a change. People who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change.	BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry.
0	You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.	What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education.

If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she can abstain from sex.
0	I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the "I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me".So yes, I "a real pro-choicer" agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type.	then why can't a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue is just that a mass a tissue.
0	Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.	It appears to me, that if slavery had been put up to a vote in Texas back before the civil war, and Texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks (which they would have), you could as simply say "Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it IS."
0	marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence.	it would keep you from getting the federal benefits--the legal context.
1	oh yes liberal: anyone who disagrees with vor regardless of their political standing. you would call frist a liberal if he disagreed with you, hell you would even goldwater a liberal if he disagreed with you.  i'm going to mentally replace farfignewgin whenever you say liberal, after all, they have the same meaning in your context.  you can support the troops by disagreeing with any mission that is unncessary in terms of security and any mission that puts troops in unncessary danger. explain to me how you can support the troops by supporting a mission that doesn't help america and gets 1600 of them needlessly killed.	so let me understand this from you libs..........you can support the troops but hope their mission fails?
1	Yep, you libs would love that. Then you could party on end without having your carnal consciences tweaked, LOL! No sin then no need for a Savior.

1	orion's follies: some other goodies from that site... never linked to those specific articles.  but before orion gets too self-righteous, let's look at some ot the topics he considered 'funny' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum: christian crimes - pastor molests widow's boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush's faith-based failure - pastor molest, guns, drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd's 'white ('n' word)'  is this funny? it's apparently real funny to orion. his link also had a pornographic sub-link on the virgin mary, describing her in graphic, profane language.  orion - christ-deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help.	one of his more assinine attempts at intelligent design.
1	Then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. He was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. It was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. He made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. Bush doesn't send kids to Iraq. First of all they volunteer. Second of all, they are older than 18. Please let me know what comments Michael Moore made that you thought were worthy. You might have trouble.	I thought for sure that he would be "outfoxed" to use a pun.
0	So now Wiesmann's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree, but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution...	Wiesmann's barrier has been breached, and in many different forms, some of which I mentioned already (see box 2).
0	i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right.	and here is a link that puts all those quotes in context.
1	Except, of course, the evidence is totally against that. Plus, there is the little matter of infant mortality... and lack of resources.   But hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you.	I'm not sure of the correct time, but there is nothing that says it couldn't have happened in that time period.
1	If you can't prove or deal in absolutes, then the basis of your argument, the "absolute" nature of logic, just became pretty shaky.	i can not prove 100% that God exist, the atheist can not prove100% that God does not exist because absolute proof is not posible.
1	Non-aggressive, yeah. That's why it's Israel that's the occupying force in Palestine and not the other way around. emoticonXWow	Simple, because Israel is a non aggressive Country surrounded by 13 very aggressive Countries who not only vowed to destroy her but have combined their military forces multiple times to try just that.
1	Yes. So you are indeed committing the genetic fallacy. And apparently unaware of the semantic ambiguity of the sixth commandment. Thanks for clarifying.	Ok. you dont have a clue where your morals come from ..is that comprehensible?You are not clear what the sixth commandment means..is that also comprehensible?
0	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.	Yeah, that's generally the conclusion that I come to which is why I see nothing wrong with abortion.

0	i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.	so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it?
0	No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat. To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers. None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing. But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin.	In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.

0	if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?	the 14th amendment further says that the states cannot pass any laws the abridge the rights you have as a federal citizen so a state cannot pass a law either that gives preference to a different faith than your own, the same limitation as the federal government.

1	reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could.	-reproduction  - if the person is religious (i do not believe god will send gay believers to hell, not sure about atheists)  - if he wants to.

0	Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.	We fundamentally disagree there.How long have you been arguing the gay marriage issue.And you state that you SUPPORT equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold-out, right?If YOUR mind can't be changed in all that time, why do you think that we could win over the nation just by having Democrats come out hot and heavy.Furthermore, THINK about it.HOW LONG have we been pushing for ENDA...And we just tried the vote, and it failed...EVEN ON THE ISSUE THAT HAS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORT, the anti-gays are able to stop the win.What do you think will happen on an issue we DO NOT have majority support on?

0	And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because "we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact.	Gravity is a fact because we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it.

There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a "fully developed" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were "totally useless", is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions.	When they reach their fully evolved form, they may have been of use, but until then, they could serve no purpose, and help the dino in no way at all, serving only as excess weight, and larger profile, hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement.

It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses. Different personalites process and categorize information in different ways. Unfortunately for many children, this is one of them. :( And unfortunately I'm speaking from experience.	Do you really believe not spanking your children will make them less likely to hit other children?
1	Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it.	A third or fourth eye is simply a copy of an existing body part.If it's a FIRST eye that evolved, then that'd count.You can't create anything new by creating copies.
1	so, clive, everyone that believes that god created the earth is an idiot? you need to spend some quality time with some that do and i think you'd change your tune.	he's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing xxxxxx that you get frequenting these boards (i can't say i blame him on the latter point).
0	Common sense? A collection of human cells as yet not developed enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human being? Uncommon sense IMO. Just the use of the term "unborn" is ridiculous. Are the rest of us the "undead"?	I don't subscribe to ANY religion.It is just common sense that murdering an unborn human being is wrong.
0	You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.	I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake.

0	I've been posting at least a few times a week. That's a lot more than once a month. I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. I think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked.	You come around about once a month, scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun, and you use that single incident as if it's evidence that there's a serious problem that threatens the entire nation.
1	Gee, and in what year did he state that? 2005? No way. 2000? No. 1995? Nope. 1990? Nah. 1985? Couldn't be. Without more information I can give an exact date, but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984, he must have said that at least 21 years ago (and if he said it in the middle of his life/career, it would have been more like 60 years ago!) - he did not know back then what we now know.	Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”50

0	The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .	In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation.
0	Why can't you answer questions directly?anyway, I support ct in passing civil unions or marriage lite as I like to see it, but It doesn't confer equality. If it is really equ8al than it would be marrige. Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that, but we don't so far and we cannot ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage.)If it is good for straight couples, it should be equally good for all couples. . No one is more superior. Everyone should be equal. Marriage for all is equals.	So you don't support Connecticut passing a civil union law?

0	Those who set the rules can do with them as they please. It isn't illogical nor hypocritical. It IS illogical to assume you can chew gum if the rule is "you cant chew gum" and the teacher allows one student to chew gum.	It would be bad enough if it was just the teacher chewing gum and telling the students don't chew gum.
1	Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???	Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right because of a physical feature is more like the slave traders than everything.

0	As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?	There is a right to own property and to travel as recognized by the US Supreme Court.
0	Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals.	While anyone can accept that a “perfect” judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before.

0	Actually, it's true. One Darwin's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection.	False and that doesn't invalide evolution given how it's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory.
0	And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?	The Christians who want to teach Intelligent Design in schools are an extreme minority that the media, in all its story-searching rating-mongering glory, is blowing out of proportion.
0	Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.	and the lie that the embro has gill slits.
0	so what you're saying is that you can't?  as a political move to satisfy the pro-life constituents that put them in office.	i don't have to do that.........if there were not abortions being performed in the 3rd trimester then why would the u.s. senate pass a bill banning it?
0	Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.	He is a prime example of what I mean.

0	unkerpaulie, thank you for this explanation. boing! eureka! i have finally concretely grasped what a 'strawman' argument is. creating something that does not exist. making mock, in a sense. sorry, i just have to reiterate the term in my terms to paste it firmly into place in my cranium.	i suggest you wait for someone to make a statement then attack/address it, rather than presuming statements that were not made and arguing against them.

0	ooo, the slippery slope argument! always a classic. the right to not be discriminated against based on her sexual orientation perhaps? what part of the dress code was she going to violate? she was going to wear formal wear. it's not like she was going to show up in ripped jeans and a slipknot t-shirt. rules designed to exclude her. their wishes don't supersede her rights.	what right was she standing up for exactly?
0	by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god.	individuals within the church are to use their god given gifts for the building up of the body to love one another and show the world what love is.

0	But is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder? It's pretty easy to find information on the FBI and the CDC websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings. People defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership, not the net benefit when it comes to safety. That would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative.	More importantly, when one gets into a car, they know that they run the risk of crashing.

0	To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition', sure. But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect.	That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition.

Perhaps you should reconsider since you're getting your ar$e handed to you with every reply I write. ;)	My dear Archangel, I wasn't aware that I was required, when I visit these forums (especially when I'm low on time like I was then, and only posted to something that caught my eye and then got off the internet), to check each and every thread to see if you graced it with your presence and to respond to that instantly.A Thousand Apologies, My Lord.
0	Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.	There's no difference between Christian Creationism/ ID and the Wapuri warrior ideal creation myth which focuses on the divine Parrot.If you are focusing on Christian creationism vs Evolution, there is more than one system of creation, and it doesn't necessarily revolve around one omnipotent, omniscient being.
0	Iangb, I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims. I also thought that (by now) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in (in this thread or by private message) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest.' At this point, I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood's definitions?

0	Well, it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain.	I am left with having to trust scientists to distinguish between the two and scientists seem to agree that one needs a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order to register pain - which does not happen until the start of the third trimester.

1	First of all a man cannot terminate tissue he isn't carrying.The father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is.	If a woman who is pregnant with a few "cell clusters" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation.
0	theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them. so i guess yes, its 50/50 so more or less half of these are likely to exist right? every imaginary thing that i could make up, half of that is probable to existing if they all can't be proven or disproven?	big foot, dragons, unicorns, mermaids, there are scientific factors that makes their existence unlikely to live in the current environment.
0	insult? i'm not sure if you're joking or just have a bad memory. but you have been making false assumptions 'aka' insulting me also. i'm not trying to insult you. i'm simply dishing out just like you are buddy. and i don't have to back up anything to a stranger i'll never meet. i know how successful i am and what degrees i have. all these false assumptions you're coming up with aren't phasing me at all. stop dishing out if you cant take it.	they still let old people like you get a ged, so i think you better get one as soon as possible.
0	exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him.	in fact, it's probable, given his devotion to science and reason, that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration.
1	Like you were raised? Looks like it didn't work and now those hormones must be kicking in? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax...their favorite victims? Males.	That would be beating the bejesus out of a kid as opposed to teaching him or her how to govern his or her impulses by themselves.
1	Calling someone a "liar", "fool hardy", "[corrupter] of the truth", and unobjective is considered complimentary where you come from? Odd, but OK, I'll go with it you lying brainwashed fool (hey, this is fun! I like using Archie's compliments!).Actually, my "sick hypothetical" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry "Corrupter! Blasphemer!" and run away. Is this your idea of "witnessing"? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat.	And regarding your sick hypothetical, it isn't a valid question at all as its based on lytes unproven third hand slander, so I see no reason to play a what if game with someone who only seeks to corrupt the truth rather than discover what it is.
1	Let's allow same-sex marriage only. Then heterosexuals will have the same right to marry someone of the same sex.	To me it has nothing to do with equal or civil rights.........It is a special right that gays want....They already have the same rights I have when it comes to marriage......They can marry anyone of the opposite sex...
1	Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?	What's the scoop here?It seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the United States because of all the gun happy nuts running around, everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting.Good idea simone, when do you start your training.I understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they're deep.

0	'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.

Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision.	When was the last time a man's life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant?
0	What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes "conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift.	But I would love to see you try and explain how 30 months in prison, a felony conviction record, and $5,000 in fines for buying two guns in one month is fair, reasonable, tough on crime, and constitutional in nature.

1	No EasyRidden.. It's you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution. America is a nation which has always had a population of christians, but it was never a Christian nation. The Words God, Jebus, Holy Spirit.. are NOT included in any of the founding documents. You can continue to ignore the history, you're the one looking like a buffoon.	Considering you left-wingers have been wearing out lawyers for the last 100 years trying to get all the vestiges of Christianity erased from our halls of government, our history books, etc., America must have been more of a Christian nation than you will ever admit.

0	You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be. This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs.	by gun nut logic children should be able to tote guns around at school because it wont make a difference because if they really wanted to kill each other, theyll just find another way to do it if they dont got guns because you know what guns dont kill people, people kill people!

0	Huh? With a 26" barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards. With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500, but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 (1.51 miles).	Then again that might be wrong and these short action calibers might have a 1,500 meter effective range, meaning that the claimed abilities of the .50 BMG are mediocre in comparison.

0	what makes you think they're not true? jesus arose from the dead. that's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not.  many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale. none succeeded and a number became believers. you guys are playing with absolute fire. if you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. big time and forever. do you feel lucky? well, do you?	for someone seemingly hellbent on accusing atheists of not understanding any other points of view, it's pretty damn idiotic to threaten us with assertions that we know aren't true.

I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.	It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
1	if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane. 'i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.' so you want the government to brainwash them?  are you kidding me? what planet do you live on?! 'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?	i don't think that killing people as a form of punishment is setting a very good example to the rest of the world - if the public start to see authorities giving people death penalties, everybody will just think that killing is ok and it will be a vicious circle!
0	Actually, I don't have any respect for creationism in most of it's varied forms. I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met. But they earned that respect.	Man, you don't have any respect for your opponents.
0	"A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon."The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm."In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'"The News regrets the error."CORRECTION	Ridiculous paperwork traps that even caught and surprised the Queen of gun control!
0	Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another, but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body. They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations' as if that justifies anything. There are things that cannot be morally obligated, no matter the relationship, so the argument tries to prove.	Blood relationships are never based on choice, yet they entail moral obligations, nonetheless.
0	could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess.	i did say that if birth control failed (condoms do sometimes too, i think their effectiveness is at like 97%, but that's not 100%) abortion should be acceptable.
0	People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things.	So if Utah made a law or a governor stated that christians didn't need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws?
1	Where, exactly, did the article say that bacteria exhibit intelligence????	Life at every level -- from humans down to bacteria -- exhibit intelligence and very often cooperation.
1	So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?   If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?   If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?   You are confusing me. Please explain.	the infirtle couples who want to have children and are capable of doing so with sciencetific methods may be married.
0	final, switzerland 1 spain 0. spain, one of the favorites or perhaps the favorite to win the world cup, loses to switzerland. what a shocker. of course with two more matches for all teams in this group anything can happen, but the pressure is on spain. they can not afford to lose another game, even a tie could mean not getting to the round of sixteen.emoticonxwow	that will go down in world cup history, especially if the loss of two points causes england to miss the final 16. i shouldn't have happened, but it did and the poor guy will live with it for the rest of his life.
0	I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The "you believe in evolution" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that.	I don't think this approach is all that new, but I have to admit that I haven't been around as many of the old-school creationists.
1	Oh yeah right, like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them, can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling.	She thinks the university's leaders should have been more open about their failure to provide the killer with adequate counselling, among other things.
1	and mythology. you forgot mythology. for example, the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths. and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed. and, of course, the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology. do you know what logic is? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy, not logic. the myths of noah are not history. and since we are talking about noah, i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed. and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history.	also, the old testament is a testament of history and prophesy while the new testament is a history of the life of jesus, the stories he told, and the letters written to churches about him.
1	Ok genius, explain to me how come it is that I dont believe in monsters, in ghosts,in luck,the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, and so many other things that a lot of people believe in, but yet I believe in God. Do I have some deep seated delusional fantasy or something like that. You seem to be wise and all knowing( maybe all powerfull as well). Yep, im convinced you are a legend in your own mind. You believe what you will, and I will do the same, and in the end we will see who is right and who is not.	I have heard that 'I used to be an atheist' nonsense by so many, yet I don't see the understanding about what it means to be an 'atheist'.
0	Considering your previous comment, that isn't you. Once again, that opinion is based upon who you read.	Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.
1	Isn't the point pretty obvious- that exposure to a gun can raise testosterone levels and trigger violent and aggressive thoughts and actions?	Posting nonsense like this proves nothing, other than the fact that you're an internet troll.
0	then why is it that closeted homosexuals that are completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate? they aren't persecuted or harassed at all since no one knows they are even having these feeling? it is self loathing that feeds their desire to harm themselves. people who know that what they are is right and good, don't harm themselves at all, but defend and support who they are even when persecuted by others. that's how it was for me when i converted from islam to christianity. all of the persecution i received just made me stronger.	umm no we feel these things because were indoctrinated by your pastors, your prayer leaders, and grow up feeling like were scum because you people have nothing better to do than scapegoat others to make your own crazed beliefs more believable.
1	So you are truthful, but I am a liar. Just like you are clever, but I am stupid. You have no respect for me, WW; I've never seen you demonstrate respect for anyone.	Why would you doubt me?
0	You lie. You keep saying the same things over and over again, that doesn't make them true. Your addiction to violence is showing.Tony Martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away. That's not self-defence, that's cold blooded murder.It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them. You don't get to take the law into your own hands. Munir Hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street. That's not self-defence, that's revenge.	Something like this belongs in the crime debate area, where I'm currently handing Jo his head over and over again.
1	Wow that worked well. Please explain where his logic is flawed in the point he made. You cant, because its not. This just proves how much this "point" along with all your other arguments have "flaws in logic" if you will.	This "point" is just mocking the other poster for flaws in logic.
0	Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.      In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak.	in fact, i have never witnessed anyone basing their entire gun control argument on the fact that 'gun owners lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand-to-hand combat.'
0	"Ready to go", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.Barbarian, regarding mutations:There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? .	So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go.
0	How about getting the government out of marriage entirely? That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry.	On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it's accepted standard in this country?
0	well, i can't say that i'm surprised. just another politician for ya. they're all the same.	remember a little while ago when the quite conservative governor of the quite conservative texas, rick perry, ordered that school girls receive the vaccine that can prevent cervical cancer?
1	i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!	you don't seem to want a written constitution either, or at least one that isn't as vauge as ours.
1	You resort to the Bible, just in whatever way is convenient to what you want it to say. Just like fundies do. Zardoz, the problem is that when you play devil's advocate (which you like to do), you ONLY take a fundie approach toward the scriptures. In fact, you're often more fundamentalist in the way you approach scripture than fundamentalists. You'd make a good fundie, the best of them, I suppose.	Just like Arch does.I counter that and use the scripture (which is good for the education in all things) to show what these 'believers' should have done.Now, if you want to actually study your bible and use contradictorary verses to support your stance, feel free.That'd just support the concept that the bible is self-contradicting.
1	The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot.	you could probably start by not calling the majority of people anti-moral, anti-family, anti-equality, anti-American, homophobes.But thats just me emoticonXRolleyes
1	probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.	Why don't you try to make George Walker Bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroying the nation of Iraq, for murdering tens of thousands of innocent women and children, for causing the deaths of nearly 3,000 young Americans who left behind mourning mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, in some cases many children who will be left to the mercy of our nation's horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their lives.
1	Because the soundbite "survival of the fittest" was coined to explain evolution to the stupid masses.	And where does the macroevolution feature in that combination?
0	Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge).	They aren't like puppies or chickens, can't get them fixed or make bar b que out of them.
1	Maybe you are and maybe you are not. You can criticize but there again you may incur the wrath of ole Doc too. emoticonXSmilie	What you choose to do about your laws is up to you.
1	He killed thousands of failed athletes? I must have missed this in the news.	I suppose his shooting of failed athletes was okay by you, also.
1	No. Not only are you wrong, you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. You oppose evolution you say, but you have no idea of what it is. Most educated creationists not only admit evolution, they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh.	You tell me that Job and Jonah are fiction.
1	oh yeah, all the most famous scientists, composers, writers, bands. all girls of course.... no, not really. yeah whitney huston, obviously way bigger than the rolling stones, beatles, who, led zeplin...... yeah great. take a step back, and read some good literature, you might learn something, un biased. opera the most powerful woman on earth> if she is, why will she die in the next 30-40 years, and how come i had never even heard of her until a little while back? how come, if she is so powerful, she is not out curing terminal diseases. oh i guess sitting on some leather sofa trying to get more ratings is way better!	oh that is a sad thing to believe :p dear boy (obviously) whitney houston beats michael jackosn demi lovato beats justin bieber karen carpenter beats every singer on earth<3 opera is the most powerfull woman on earth, obama is said to be the most powerfull man on earth, but i seriously think that opera wins this one too.
1	It might be telling that super heroes typically don't use firearms. That I'd prefer my crowds to have few if any guns concealed within hardly makes me pro-crime. Nor does it make me a pacifist. I'm a big fan of violence. The hands on kind.	He would also break the speed limit, but not run a stop light...but he protected innocent people with violence toward criminals.
1	i am surprised scientists havn't made so much of a fuss about you. wow......	is that like a dude + a pony?
0	Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.	Or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage?
0	good questions. its not a condition, i don't agree.  jesus doesn't open the lock to the pearly-gates for some people, he is the gate. do you see what i mean? that's what he said, 'i am the way... no one comes to the father except through me'. i think its like saying you shouldn't put conditions on the way into a house, you should be able to walk in from any spot - and saying that having to go through the door is a condition. why would people not choose heaven? its a hard road.	i know, you're going to say that people are refusing to go when they don't accept god, jesus into their lives.
1	You still don't get it do you, Smiley... emoticonXBanghead If cupcakes were human? It would.	This does not make it an individual (noun).
0	So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.	When San Jose, California, police test-fired an Uzi, a 30-round magazine was emptied in slightly less than two seconds on full automatic, while the same magazine was emptied in jus
1	Well, I guess you got something there. . . . . .can't put the cart before the hose!!	Yo shush yo mouth!Doncha knows that tha bible is fo believahs!Yas gotta believah furst!That's right, if you read it without believing first, you'll see the flaws and contradictions.
1	Are you jealous because they won't let you out of the institution while gansao get's to run all over the place?	What are you calling it?Are you simply jealous because you lack writing skills and no one has considered you for anything outside of menial labor?
1	Are you trying to be funny in a "I'm the one who drew attention to this aspect in the first place, but now I'm going to criticize you for talking about what I drew attention to" type mentality?	Focus on the reason for the arrest rather than the issue that caused his refusal to leave.
0	I would be interested to see where I made such a claim. Prove your assertion.	Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as "assault weapons" are "inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip".
1	Actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. And anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides.	The same history that led John Major and Anthony Blair to apologize to the Irish people.
0	Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.	The bill would also protect gun manufacturers and dealers that have allowed their weapons to fall into the hands of criminals through their own negligence.
1	thats true. i helped. my next bible will be 10 times better if i get around to finishing it	The Bible was written by many of the wisest men in history.
1	accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'.	you attack bp by focusing on its mistakes so that it can be held accountable by trial.
1	What difference does it make? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents? If so doesn't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas?	Like, how many shooting in Germany?Like, what's the ratio of shootings to population in the two nations of Germany and the U.S?
0	once again when is my life, what i do, and who i love, who i marry, any more thier business then theirs is to me? you still haven't answered my question. why do they get a say in my life yet i don't get the same say in their lives? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious xxxxxx are is just cruel and evil. it is my life my family not theirs. they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust. you are defending an unjust system.	people aren't going to stop standing up for what they believe in, and doing what they think is right.
0	What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842).	BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!
0	if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing.	ok, lets use that logic.... to the gay folks i say marry a woman.
0	I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.	We do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation.As for the secular rights, I don't think this is right.From a religious standpoint, I've never seen more ignorance, hatred or twisted lies put into words as I have on this board from some of the folks who are Christians.
1	Which is why the "medical establishment" endorses smoking, drinking heavily and a fatty diet, with no excercise, because they believe we are predestined by our genes, right? Why do you persist with these blatant lies?	ythe medical establishment has convinced people that we are what we are because what our genes say we are
0	What's a "marriage officer"? If that's like a priest or minister, than certainly they shouldn't have to perform a ceremony that doesn't coincide with their beliefs. But if it's a government position, like a justice of the peace, then they should either leave their religion at home when they go to work, or get a job that doesn't conflict with their beliefs. Religious freedom does not give you the freedom to deny freedom to someone else.	They did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it non-mandatory to some extent:"But it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her "conscience, religion and belief.
0	Criminals continually inform the public that their greatest fear is a victim capable of fighting back against them and possibly killing them.	Criminals, being the lowlife, deviant scum they are, would never be smart enough to anticipate the possibility that their victims might be armed, and would thus never take along guns themselves.
1	jesus christ srom!!! you live in the stone age... i'm surprised you have internet access.	no, i don't watch fox news because i don't have those channels.
0	He's pointing out that the situation is about the mother and the baby, and that the baby's right to life ends exactly where the woman's right to personal autonomy begins. That's the interesting thing about rights-based ethics, that the rights of any individual are limited precisely by the rights of all other individuals.	What are you talking about?
1	Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so "self-confident" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.	If you think he can I am not surprized that you think Mr. Dawkins has superb logic.

0	I think that the bad guys will be happy if any gun control law goes into effect, because then there will be less chance of the victum having a weapon for their defense, and the crime rate will rise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Well I have to say that I beleive if we banned all air guns that violence, murder, carjackings, rapes, and all violent crime would drop.

1	Do you have something-other then words from a dusty old book of myth to offer as an explanation?	Because science continues to LOSE GROUND in its search for explanations for origins of the first life?
0	Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them :)Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.	Monkeys show sense of justice Absolutely amazing.
0	I don't understand this business of the UK and England at all. It seems to me that somebody has a chip on their shoulder. Who cares? Chomsky is not as bad as the terrorists. That's an obvious fact. What is equally obvious is that he provides aid and comfort to the enemy and that's the definition of a traitor.	:)  On the issue of Chomsky, are you saying his writings on American make him as bad as the terrorist who kill and maim People ?

1	I don't know about you..but being shot in the back is more human than being taken apart piece by piece. If I recall correctly, Chinese inmates sentenced to death are executed this way to minimize the pain.

0	Well, thank you for this thread Santafeur. I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff. The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me. In fact, I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about. What difference does it make? We are here now. Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?	what is so fascinating about something you'll never live long enough to witness if it does exist and that you've seen all there is to see of if it doesn't exist?does anyone here really lack in something to validate themselves so much that they have to turn to a bunch of dead animals to find a reason for living?
0	Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.	How can what did not erode for 100 million years to expose a full dino print, now be eroding only within the last 40?
1	Archie, the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says, every accepted definition of the words socialism, statism, capitalism, fascism and nazism. If we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words, it STILL does not work because the argument is STILL illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it.   Face it. You got pwned. Are you really not bright enough to recognize that?	While at the same time, right now, aren't we seeing our own government promoting increased regulations in overseeing the control of these corporations, just as Hitler did in Germany?
0	Sounds pretty neat. I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?	I have been there and felt the chill when I saw what could only be prints of very old humans co-existing with dinosaurs.
1	so you reference shakespeare to explain the song of solomon? seems rather convoluted, but whatever.	you go to the public library and look up the oxford english dictionary--which i explicitly named.
1	Oh, I think you take delight in spelling it out in excruciating detail. Otherwise, you'd reply on point.	I didn't feel that I needed to spell it out in excruciating detail for you.
1	My mistake; I read it wrong. And guess what? I do know what the moon is ;)	I had said "what if" the Moon (You know, that big round object which appears a lot in our night sky.)
0	That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources "until the newborn dies" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.	Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).

Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.	the only stupid gun laws are the laws that arent strict enoughlike the law that gun nuts wanted that would allow children to tote around assault rifleshow stupid can you be
1	since when has religion been pragmatic or based upon systems that works?  Obvious answer: never.	did you read the news report about bush's former friend who taped him regretting his former days of indulgence?
0	well, i'm back from my rejuvenating outing. did i have any epiphanies, you ask?  what, one wonders, could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted, their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived, without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times, and ennoble us in our daily pursuits.	well, my views are probably shaded by my anger of religion, after being under its influence for all of my childhood and a better part of my adult life.

0	Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims. PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.	IM2L844: The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved.
1	Cool I want to be free of the regulation that I wash my hands before preparing other peoples food.

0	religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected. why? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes, unless you are a black gay. it is the way each class is treated that is the same. coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people. the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth.	as explained the last time we crossed paths matthew, there is no evidence presented that would suggest homosexualism is in any way a legitimate aspect of life for differentiating one from another.

1	So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?	It seems clear to me: if you are not sure it's not human, don't kill it.

0	deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said. You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought. In fact, some of the cited refute such claims.	I got no idea what you are talking about.
1	You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican.

0	i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.	the reason we can tell this is that virginia and those other named states do not have higher crime rates than the cities with strict gun laws.
1	You actually have some full insight into gays and what we have gone through and think were pathetic. Once again insults and a bigoted view Archie. You never cease to amaze me.	You may have bought into that image lesz, but I can plainly and clearly see the full extent of the misery index which comes with the homosexual lifestyle.
0	i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?	the point i'm making is the rejection of these doctrines does not make the fundamentalist protestant churches any less christian, nor is the rejection necessarily incorrect, and the same principle applies to reform judaism.
1	Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases.	That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists.
0	With regard to this statement you have to consider:1. How can anyone know what product an "intelligent designer" wanted.2. Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia.But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants.	An intelligent designer would design a system to produce the product as easily as possible.

0	I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.	It's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal.

0	Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to "polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it." Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it.	Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious.
1	to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion.	maybe it could have been a better plan, but what we have now is better than the nothing we've had under mostly republicans.. clinton being the only democrat who also failed to deliver ....
0	Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce "remotely" from Virginia.Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS.	Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely, if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else.
0	i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost.	hard to make people happy when you attack other countries causing you to spend well into debt thus lowering your economy and bringing other economies with it.
1	your daddy plugged your hole?? is that why you are so sour. i guess you ate too many beans recently, and that made you full the holy spirit..	then call the police, or whoever it is you're currently whining to, if you don't like it.
0	and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance? or for credit cards, for that matter? the cost of a policy, or card, is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer. don't want to pay high premiums, take the risk on yourself. period. i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another's morality. we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know.	it is affordable and obtainable for those who do not actually need it, but impossible to get or unaffordable if you can.
0	But my relationship is between a man and woman. You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that. Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman.	OK, are YOU willing to settle for legal recognition of your relationship with your spouse under federal and state laws as a "civil union" only?
1	That sort of warms the cockles of my heart. Namely that some Europeans might be disinclined to visit or stay here. Don't let the door hit you in the buttocks on the way out.

0	See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.	Diseases used to be ascribed to God and it was thought that those people who got sick deserved to be sick because of their lack of piety.
1	I can understand your disappointment. Its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions. No easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim.

WOW, in one fell swoop you completely destroyed my faith in God.
0	When was the last mass murder at a UK university then?	with tens of millions of gun owners, and hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and you think the guns are still the problem....
0	Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.	I thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage.

1	Your "opinion" was a kindergarten question outlining a "problem" that never existed, a "problem" that was explained to you 3 or 4 times.

I just realized it's a waste of time sharing my opinion with you self important XXXXXX who think you have such a grasp on science that you dazzle yourselves into a frenzy.
0	You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean "will", "must", or "shall" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it "CAN" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun.	You should really think about what you say before you say it.

And I'd think the explanation would be that oxygen content was much different before the flood

0	So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's "weak gun control laws" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?It seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to America, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons. They've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there, they can make whatever they need or want.	You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms.

0	an innocent person can be convicted of a crime--i thought that was what the topic was about. just because they are convicted, doesn't mean they are 100% responsible, guilty, etc for that crime-but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system--they are guilty. that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years--they are convicted of a crime. i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics, then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence. okay, everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on--what is it with you people? like i said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.  comprende' ?	are you saying that in the past no one has been wrongly executed when we are now seeing dna and other tech freeing inmantes basically every 2 months?

1	So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is.	Frankly I thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agencies and organizations which they may need to interact with in the future.

Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government.	Right is one thing, but duty?

0	dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views..	if a man can't exercise that self control, to a point where he rapes a woman, then he does deserve jail.
0	Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe.	No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced.

In Plessy the Supreme Court ruled that black men weren't entitled to the same facilities as white men, rather they had to have their own private facilities, separate from those of white men.Forget precedent, the Supreme Court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled.
1	business is a purely private association. you mean like interracial marriage? 'social harm' is just another term for 'things i personally find distasteful'.	i am hopeful that once we get a democrat in the white house, that will change.

0	George Bush won the majority of votes (the first majority winner in 16 years) in an election with the highest turnout in US history (>117Million voters). The Senate Minority Leader was defeated by a nobody. Democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the House and Senate, something that never happens in a Presidential election year. This gave the Republican majority in both branches of Congress even more control. 11 Liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins. If liberalism ISN'T dead, then it's in ICU on a heart and lung machine. emoticonXRolleyes	I would like to point out that it was hardly a land slide.
1	Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:  Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?

1	So you think that ID is actually Christanity?

0	Oh, really? Does that mean that pesticides will be OK on marijuana plants? NO.	* Smoking tobacco is quite unhealthy even without pesticides.
1	And you're baffled that you don't have more intelligent debate with people. I'm shocked.	There is nothing wrong with honest intelligent debate on this issue, but the anti-gun crowd don't bring honest intelligent arguments to the table.
1	oh really, a combination of the words expel and arm mean to expel arms? wow, she was a creative genius! i think what he meant was rowling just takes all the stereotypical magicy stuff and mashes it all together into a tacky and overused paste.	i think expelliarmos means to expel (get rid of) arms (weapons).
1	Did you notice how what I was responding to was said? I didn't think so. Your tunnel vision is showing again.	Its not what you're saying its how you're saying it.
0	what is capitalism? can there be something like 'responsible capitalism' and, if so, what would 'responsible capitalism' be? my view is that the term 'capitalism' has a multitude of meanings dependent upon who is defining it and that 'capitalism' could have a multitude of modifiers to further refine its meaning. is to be a capitalist to be utterly free of responsibility and blame for the evils that capitalism may cause?	if it is, i don't share your sentiments.

0	This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?	I wonder how many of these "great physicists" also believed that night air could make them ill?
0	Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton.	So a piece of stonehas the force of gravity as its own property does not it?
0	but why should i care about their emotions? they obviously don't care about mine. this is in reference to the jonestown massacre, where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink (i don't think it was actually kool-aid) laced with cyanide. okay.	as for the kool-aid: i often see this referenced in arguments between americans, i have no idea what it is.
1	Anyone speaking English could well be an illegal from the UK then, right? I guess Puerto Ricans better watch out too.	It is reasonable to suspect anyone speaking Spanish in Arizona as being an illegal alien.
1	I was eight at the time. I'll read up and get back to you. Mind your manners.	It was these same gun control nuts that chose to intentionally not require private transfers to involve background checks.You missed the opportunity back in 1968, you have no room to gripe about it now.
0	Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.	That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4.
1	So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies.	Why do you talk past me so I feel like I'm eavesdropping on a post intended for someone else?
0	Not quite. To be more correct regarding government and guns, the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence.Our political philosophy is very clear on this:"that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" - Declearation of IndependaceYou have the right to try and revolt with violence. You don't have the right to win a revolt.	One of the biggest arguments against gun control is that if the government became too oppressive, the people wouldn't have the capacity to carry out a successful rebellion.
0	How is that a strawman? Your challenge directly relies upon something you assume to be proven, but has not been. Therefore even in a hypothetical stance, your underlying arguments are invalid, thus leading to everything else being invalid. You're not doing so well on this forum.	And where, pray tell are you pulling THIS strawman from?
1	Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity ).	How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God?
0	i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills.	there are many problems with society depending on which part of society one belongs to.
0	Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick.	This is not true.
1	Why not? My mother has been 39,for the last 39 years.	''No, actually the earth is 150 years old.
0	I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress. It's all politics.	So why, in this gun-hater's dream come true of congress, did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law?
0	Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.	And why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ?

0	are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire.	the size of mortgages is such that even a small rate change will push many over the limit of affordability.

0	Oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? They're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept.	Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring
0	walking-fish: has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10^23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe. what is it about science that you don't understand?	ok ill ask it in a different way has anyone obseved us evolving frmo monkeys?.....

0	Actually, there is no such thing as "an evolutionary mutation of a gene." A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?	An evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed.
0	Mythology. But nevertheless, shipbuilding has been going on for a lot longer than 500 years. There have been a lot of skilled shipbuilders who have passed along their knowledge from generation to generation. Do you think that every time someone builds a ship that they invent the whole process? Nah. 300 ft is about the limit for wood no matter how you design it. Even worse it you cast a big box adrift in a huge storm. How did the animals survive the rolling and rolling?	And you do realize that Noah was about 500 years old when he started the ark.
1	Amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term "light year."   If I am so ignorant, explain how your argument does not require exactly what I said: That God operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young Earth Creationism.   I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar.	The ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums, much less this ONE.

1	Um, Bassman, so you, the one person in the world who is as "pure as the wind-driven snow," is the one who may judge others, including Democrats. Um, for the record I grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of "wind-driven snow" and it was not particularly pure. A feeble and laughable metaphor.	Democrats are not clean and pure as the wind driven snow, they do not have an absolute birthright to govern, and they certainly are not the only ones qualified to govern!
1	btw, jazyjason, before you edited out your complimentary comment about howard dean. just wanted to say i'm surprised you said anything to associate yourself thus with a such an irrational far left commie. must stay with the mudflingers and lynch mobs and, especially if they're jesus lovers, ya know. so ... i understand why you took it down. merry christmas.	although i think it was feingold who said that obama has gotten the bill he intended to, from the beginning.

0	Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).	Would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity, mind, consciousness or existence in actuality?
1	Well, maybe the pistol and the hunting rifle, what do you need an automatic weapon? Have the deer gotten faster?	Now I think it does get a little extreme with owning several M-16s, but if I want to own a pistol, a shotgun, and some fancy automatic, well that's my right.

0	Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person.	My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, fetus, etc., is a Someone.
1	Where did you here this XXXX?Some cheap detective novel or something?Once again, my sincerest apologies.	Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever is left, however improbable, must be the truth.

1	Well, considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are, I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others.	So, when we believe the gospel, the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Christ's body, and our sins are forgiven through His shed blood.
0	Just curious, is it beyond you to make a post that includes common sense and logic? I'm thinking it is since all of you posts seem to be based on rhetoric and emotion. Three paragraphs and all of them contain a falsehood/ lie, congrats your batting 1.000.	Every time I see another story about another shooting in America, sometimes ever two or three shootouts and killings, it absolutely thrills me because I know that the NRA has armed even more Americans and more Americans can now go out and shoot and kill and maim.So, carry on, NRA!
1	Not true. I googled "helpful mutation" and got a nice list of examples. I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions.	The failure to observe even one mutation that adds information is more than just a failure to find support for the theory.
0	Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc...	I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old.
0	But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No.   Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No.	Marriage is to promote children bearing and making a family unit.
0	I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.	Is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax?

0	But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the "discrimination" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ... emoticonXRolleyesAnyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess.	Some Iowa county recorders say they have contemplated refusing to give a marriage license to gay couples who walk into the office, but so far none is vowing to do so.“This is putting us in a very, very difficult position here,” Wayne County Recorder Angela Horton said Thursday in an interview.

0	that explains why your politician can work together i bet your current government is made of a collation ? in the uk parliament we still have a first past the post system where the party with the majority form the government.  it is slightly different in scotland we have a hybrid system of pr and first past the post, the politics in scotland has changed slightly in fact the executive is made up of a collation between two parties. this has the effect of making our politics more consensual where parties can actually discuss and negotiation solutions without party politics and vote scoring.	very representational with a 4% floor concerning the national parliament (that is; you need at least 4% of the votes to be given mandates in the riksdag (national parliament))

0	i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?	i think your question should be 'why did god make commandments?'
0	No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God.	of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard "n" is right next to "b" last time I checked).
0	i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate. as for my personal take, 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that. do you disagree? prejean should not have lied about it. anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy. seeing some of hilton's work, i don't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody. i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about' is exactly why he was chosen.	wow, foundit is apparently quite the staunch anti-indecency advocate.
1	How about not clicking the "reply " button twice (heh,heh,) No, we didn't (Thank goodness) AND! PM Blair is recanting from the Kyoto protocol. Bully for him!	Yes, we've signed it, how about you?How about Iraq for not "respecting national autonomy"?
0	You only say that it won't make a change because you support the effects it will have.	You may have the right to keep and bear arms, that doesn't exempt you from being treated differently on the basis of your choice to do so, anymore than your right to free speech exempts you from being treated differently if you advocate segregation or paedophilia.
0	Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.	It's a good argument for doing away with the death penalty and their expensive trials.
1	Kill or be killed, survival of the fittest? No compassion, the rule of tooth and fang? WOW, color me impressed!	I suspect the correct religion is the one practiced by all non-humans on the planet.
1	So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.	creation is so easy to know.
0	well, signorile certainly didn't back up his opinions in this instance. how do you know it's the truth? if it were definitive, i'd be more inclined to agree. it's not 'common knowledge' that merv griffin was gay, at least not outside of hollywood. i'd never heard it myself. i don't see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were (like having sex with someone of the same gender).  and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 80s is absolutely opinion.	it may have been an opinion piece (as are all blogs), but he indicated he researched these facts for a book he had written.
0	The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc	I'm new to this idea that science has over-ruled Creation.
0	thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression.	so lets see how many other people are being targeted by the inquisition for their faith by the big three.
0	What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent.It's the woman's body that carries the fetus. It ultimately the woman's decision. As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion.	I'm sorry but the baby is a part of both of them.Should it be that the mother decides to keep the baby and the father want's her to terminate the state will still come chasing for child support.Why the father didn't get a say on if the baby was born or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law says so.
1	Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion.	I CAN EMPIRICALLY PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE GOD OF THE BIBLE VIA ITS CENTRAL CLAIMS
0	i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?	from now on, they should just fire all the judges and lawyers and let me decide.
1	Turned?  What do you mean turned?  (Oh man! Got you one more time! Brutal! lol)	guess i'll turn in now....beings that i've done turned nerd...
1	It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?	The laws are strictly enforce although they can still be beaten.
0	Now, now ZSU, we learned from comrade star gazer that GW created the Continental Army. I am sure these gentlemen have some equally illogical and inaccurate 'facts' to scatter around the barnyard emoticonXHoho	Ah the non human part.
0	And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology.	Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins.
0	No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system.	More concrete than the thought processes which dismiss out of hand the flat statement of the US Secretary of State opining that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, but allow them only to be lawfully held by the state?
1	If it isn't so hard then why haven't you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.	“Not that hard to figure out dude...What is your proof?”
0	do we want to have control over ourselves? some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. i dont know much on this matter, im only 14. but, ive been to a conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. its a narrow minded hellhole.	no i mean why not for people.
1	what did i previously tell you, i.e. well hey, moose, you're in a topic which highly relates to the bible. if you want a secular response there's plenty of those guys around. if you want to chat with me i'll usually be coming from a biblical perspective. but i'll be glad to talk with you on a secular subject if you want. what are you looking for? p.s. please hold your 'honest attempts at discussion' rants, ok? i could easily claim the same with you since you are out of god's wisdom. but i won't. what did you want to know? again, what did you want to know?	i say your interactions are not honest because you persist in these diversions, instead of directly answering with ideas that came out of your mind.
1	are you talking about this one??? he was talking about 'god'. he never said your 'god'. and i am both amused and bored by the fact that i just explained to you how evolution and a belief in a creator can co-exist, and you completely ignored it. but you're going to continue to claim that they are mutually exclusive, won't you...	did you not see the post by obvious child that i answered foundit?
1	This is great. You mean none of the Davidic line ever copulated with women to produce their descendents? LOL!	Which of course, , would not have made him the 'seed of david', because the 'seed of david' could only be through the unbroken male line (no women in the mix).
1	B.S. simone. He was the perfect age for Vietnam. Why hasn't he released his draft card? I know, they only sent them to citizens.	It wasn't necessary for President Obama to be in the military when he was coming up but he sure wouldn't have crapped out like George W. Bush and sent someone else to die in his place in Vietnam.
0	And if God was so against killing the unborn, why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn, why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women?I bet you won't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do. See my signature for examples.	He was declaring war on an unclean people whom He commanded the Jews to wipe out in a time of WAR.
0	I got ya, but I still disagree. if free will doesnt exist, then why should I make an effort to do anything? if I am destined to be wealthy, then no matter how lazy I am today, I'll be wealthy sometime down the road. and if Im destined to poor, no amount of hard work and diligence on my part can change that. why wouldnt I just drift along life and allow destiny to take me where I will inevitably end up?	I am sayin that salvation is not a choice.
0	He is a hell of a lot wiser than thee.	Let's just point out, as far as the article is concerned, just how many of your fellow Americans you're talking about.And what they must think about someone like you.
1	You do realize you just disproved your own basic points yes?   The pictures you posted are falsified because abortion clinics and small health clinics contract out to places to have their medical waste incinerated.   Good job on failing to realize you just proved Cunx correct.	Can you imagine the cost for every abortion clinic if they owned their own medical waste incinerator?
1	Actually, I read that the god of the bible was really a macaroni monster. He likes cheese, too.	It doesn't really connect to your comment, the whole Paris Hilton theory spawned from eating a whopper and trying to be a nuisance, both of which were highly successful.
0	john mccain is nothing more than another rino. he is the media's darling from the gop.	even though i am extremely liberal, i kind of liked mccain--until he kissed up to bush after bush and his people crapped all over him in south carolina.
1	You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.	You know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non-sentient life forms victims and referring to martin Luther King Jr. to justify their views.
0	Any belief system is a religion loosely defined. I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?	Your belief that a fetus deserves the same rights as fully developed people does.
0	think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is "wrong" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image	Since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect.
0	"He" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality. For some of us it's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day. But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists, it does nothing to lessen His reality.	No disrespect intended in that I agree with you in that "he" is real to you, just as Santa is to children whose parents told them there is a REAL Santa.
0	No, not really. All that is different is the number of steps.  What is YOUR definition of 'macro-evoution'? Is it speciation? Or is it a brand new genus?  We have observed speciation, where new species happened.	It may be perfectly legitimate to make these inferences, but the point of the statement from wikipedia  was that micro-evolution is directly and (more importantly) currently observable.
1	And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?	And when you're high, you're too ignorant and doped up to know that it's the marijuana that's making you act like a XXXXX.
1	I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?	I will not alter my foundational belief in marriage and family just because some cry for freedom at all costs.
0	Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems.	The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.
0	So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.	It turns out, the Johns Hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life.
0	First of all, it's not a precedent. this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional. Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called "lawlessness". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some "agenda" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us.	People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws.
1	That's nice, but have you ever thought of reading your own religion's Holy Book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that Jesus and his disciples said?	in Philly so I know my catechism...That is what is important to me..........
1	As usual, you shoot from the lip. I have no illusion of perfection, However I am convinced that as long as you live I will never be the dumbest man on earth.	I am sorry the only perfect man that ever lived was Jesus Christ and maybe you in your own mind
0	is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers.	no doubt that people who are determined to be anti-bush will always try and find something wrong with it, but i think bush's speech last night was very good.
1	What prompted this?  I guess I need to check what website I'm in...  Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. But, I've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.  But, carry on, Orion. You've shown your true colors now. Cluck at will... emoticonXChicken emoticonXRolleyes	you'll pardon me, please, if i view your response as that of an idiot or dolt.
0	So we should just say "god did it", and give up?	The fact is foundit, that creationists and I-Ders understand that there are so many unanswerable questions, so we know we can't answer them for certain, because Man just doesn't have the knowledge to discern the truth from the minutia.
1	Has the American Medical Association decided to recognize that aluminum, steel and polymer and addictive narcotic substances that can drastically alter a person's mental status?	What about a firearm junkie?
1	Primarily from your side of the aisle in all arguments. You really described yourself a T.	Sinjin, have you ever considered the problem of murky, misinformed, not to mention willfully ignorant, understanding?It seems to be something that one encounters a lot in these here precincts.
0	because it shows that your data is not absolute, and that there is supporting evidence for both sides? it also stops you justifiably saying things like... the data speaks for itself. in america, guns save more lives than are taken by them. fact. did you know that in the uk, i am statistically at least twice less likely to be killed than you? fact. it works both ways...	ha...what is the point of posting data if you are just going to conclude there isn't enough data?
1	you're kidding. just because your life is 'a fricken breeze' that doesn't mean the other 7 billion people on this earth have a breezy life. have you even watched the news lately? it's either that, or you live on another planet.	i don't know what people are complaining about.
0	Very true, especially since when someone asks "is there a God" they are most likely really asking "does the God in which I believe exist"	they could just as well not be there, and life as we know it would be the same.
1	3101 posts! what a waste of cyber real estate! at least you are brief.	Al Bore is nothing but a political opportunist to the Nth degree.
1	honestly did not know that acorn was such an evil organization that was based on evil-ness.  but really acorn seems like a very good organization based on helping those in need of help. i was under the impression of something totally different. i guess don't believe what you hear on fox news =]	http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/10/did_obama_lie_about_ayers.html  as for acorn... yeah, these guys look like real sons of bitches... everyone knows trying to help the poor makes you a radical commie.
0	And if the "natural process of evolution" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked?	So, when Miller says "I believe in Darwin's God", he is saying that God sustains the natural process of evolution and an intermediate agent.
1	You mean you don't think you have your own made-up religion?? How interesting! Do you really think you're fooling God? Or us?? Or even yourself??	Do you really think you're fooling God?
1	Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.	It's unparsimonious.You don't need absolute proof for something to be valid.
0	oh yes, the rhubarb is one of my favorites too. a fine choice..you get a cake emoticonxbirthdaycake	oh my how i love pie.
1	there is no problem in what you 'believe' in. science is irrelevant in many beliefs. just sole belief in a deity and his disciples, is what many religions revolve around. but, i am astounded by your god's name, no harsh feelings. a dragon lord king is quite a mouth full don't you say? can we just call em, greeble. :)	now, let us pray to the one true creator of the universe king greeble the dragon lord.
1	Now, that logic is so bad, it's worse than circular reasoning. It's figure eight reasoning.	God IS GOOD all the time and in the end God will win meaning creation beats evolution every time.
1	I guess the European union is a great failure? Is that why the Euro is trending 1.5 dollars as liberalism creats misery?	The idea is that Conservatism works every time it is properly implemented.
1	have you considered a career in advertising?  by the way you f***ed us too. Australians troops were cannon fodder in WWI for the British Empire, remember Gallipoli?	we gave you 'f*ck' too, but do you really think that 'australia: so what the f*cking hell are you waiting for' would be an appropriate ad campaign just because we started the word?
1	No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is "pro-evolution". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's "faith-based" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach	As for who plays 'word-games', it seems that you missed this... #19 "New peppered moth stuff"He went on for some time trying to undermine my posts based on the use of a word which most people have a problem with.There's also the problem with Darwin claiming a tautology was a better term than "Natural Selection", this was debated for some time, even though I posted the actual words of Darwin.The thread "Unto the Ages of Ages" developed into a debate over whether something could be both ''more accurate' and wrong, thanks Ursus!WJA and SLP argued over the word 'applied', then 'published'; whether Dembski had, and then changed this to 'proved' (see "Looking for intelligence" thread)Lurch/Ungerdunn etc over what is a 'noun'.
1	Hey, someone has to clean our toilets. This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education.	Families that embrace ID/Creationism are increasingly deciding that their children have no place in the "classroom".
1	are you completely incapable of making sense? penfold used deliberately obtuse language. this language was then explained to you. now you are arguing that 'turn the other cheek' is completely different, and in no way similar, to 'revolve/rotate' the other cheek. if you turn something, you revolve or rotate it. you're so busy being affronted by what people say that you come off as even more simple than they try to make you appear.	but for anyone to actually argue that penfold used clearly descriptive language in getting his point across, proves that you all are either too ignorant to know any better, or you're just taking this stance in order to stand against me.
1	And, let's see, when did the job loss actually start?   Oh yes.. We can trace the troubles starting in 2007, with a big melt down in August/September of 2008. Let's see.. Obama must have been a terrible president to have caused that.. oh WAIT. That wasn't Obama, that was BUSH.. Excuse Me.	It's the loss of non-government jobs that people don't like.
0	So was I. I did say I was playing devil's advocate. As far as I'm concerned, Tiktaalik is a triumph of scientific deduction.	I just was impressed that the fossil was not found by happenstance.
0	I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed. an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human. this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.	my opinion, their banning a gun because of the way it looks they seem to think an ak47 is worse than a regular gun because it looks like a military gun the only true (assault weapon) is fully automatic i have.
1	Did you even read ythe OP? Did you even read the title?   Pointless distinction? Huh.   I understand what you are saying. I also know you are changing your argument. When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it.	Either that or you're pretending to not get it.
1	And you wonder why people call "republicans" racist, women hating bigots. (hint: it's comments like yours)	The only reason Obama is even in office is because blacks are voting for a black man and free stuff, Hispanics want no borders, and most women don't know or don't care how bad the Obama liberals are digging America into the ground financially.
0	That's certainly your right, but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda, not a scientific one. He may want it disguised as a scientific one, but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire.	I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.
0	Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'.	It can certainly be a false theory, however, you can rationally show that it is or is not (to the degree determined by your evidence).
0	it is no "story"........i am debating on the whole evolution thing... look at the facts. so many great ppl, physics people, niels bohr, he was for evoulution, then he found out all of the facts that it is junk, so he became a christian	Is this a debate over the accuracy of the Genesis creation story or just a debate over the general idea that God did in fact create the world and it's inhabitants?
1	Hmm maybe I should take that one to a local patent office...	Glory holes in public conveniences is a gay invention not mine.
1	And, I'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker, right?	I would just want the woman to ask that question before she spreads her legs.Dono
1	So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws).   But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal.	How can you think that a baby that isn't born yet a nonentity?yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what "abortionist's" say is a load of ****!!
1	Is it not extremely cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not suffer from hypothermia due to the extreme cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not fall from the sky and break near all his bones when the wheel well opened for landing after a lengthy flight at 35,000 feet? Do I have to give you the flight number and type of airplane in order to get my stuffed animal circus prize?	For example, when and why did he die of hypothermia?
0	I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are.	They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) ...
0	How do you know carbon dating is so accurate? Would you bet your life on it?	Carbon dating is only accurate up to a point, and that point is WELL beyond creationism's statements.
1	Does this mean that you have finally repented of your multiple divorces??	[B]Let it not be said the grace of God for salvation in Jesus Christ is not freely available.
1	Another red herring gay argument. Ever hear of a medical power of attorney? You don't need marriage to have one, you know. emoticonXRolleyes	It's amazing that someone would list making medical decisions for a loved one who is unable to as a benefit.
1	Ahh, pointy tailed devils with pitchforks, more of your menagerie of divvels, demons, saints, angels, demigods, ghosts and other varied superstitious nonsense. Which of your gods created them, Snerdley?	That serpent, the devil, has been having his way with you for some time now.
1	Come on down to skid row with the rest of us 'lower class' I'll even buy a bottle of MD 20/20 on me.	Alas, I can no longer drink any sort of alcoholic beverage, although I used to love to drink the excellent foreign beers, high grade gin, scotch, brandy etc., in other words, sipping whiskey as opposed to the cheap raw stuff that the lower classes guzzle up.
1	oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.	Don't know about anyone else, but I don't think you have that much impact on our lives SS Who's more arrogant?
0	I know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but I think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has, what post number this is, how many are left, any comments concerning going outside the rules, etc.	Once the debate has begun, I will not make another post until the end.One week sounds reasonable - you might want to post within a shorter gap later on, but that will be up to the person posting.
0	What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking.	That's my claim
0	What possible concern is any of that to you?    Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon.	Do you believe that you will hear an understanding of God that you've not heard before, or are you of the belief you are open-minded on the subject, and might well have an epiphany?
1	Simone, read the sentence again please. It was "Saving lives is "not just" a Republican goal." It concerns the subject of abortion.   The only way it relates to the politics of Iraq, is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to "volunteer" their services for Iraq.   I can't let one statement you made go though. Terrorist continue to terrorize us? Where have they attacked in the U.S. since 9-11? Consider continuing this in an appropriate thread.	Saving lives is a Republican goal?Then, why have the Republicans condemned us to this ugly, nonproductive war in Iraq?The terrorists continue to terrorize us because we have deterred our efforts against them to Iraq, (and Bush intends to widen this nonproductive war into Iran and Syria) where nearly 700,000 Iraqis have been needlessly slaughtered, where more than 3,000 of our young have been sacrified in vain, and you have the audacity to say that "saving lives is a Republican goal.
1	your "minds"? How many do you have? Oh, and "I wanted to see what inferior it was"? Nice example of your supposed superiority.	Not because it could effect what was said (it was pointless to your position) but because I wanted to see what inferior it was.
1	'slaves, tortures, drones, dictators' hmm, what does that sound like? oh yeah, the history of most european countries, including germany.	america invaded more countries, today has less freedoms (patriot act and so on), of all countries in the world germany is the only one, that hasn't a 'shady' history, cause everything has been come to light and regretted.
1	Yet another of your posts that wouldn't pass the Turing Test...	If he had not, we would still be living in the stone ages.
0	the government has no business invading into the private, legal activities of two individuals. and how is requirement able to defeat straw purchasers? if you don't feel comfortable making the sale, don't make it. it's as simple as that.	i expect them to go to someone who can make sure the transaction isn't illegal one way or the other.
1	THe religious reigh is not mainstream either. And frankly, you are also confusing politics and religion. You do KNOW that there is a difference? You also know there is a differnece between hateful proclimations and scholarship, don't you??	The liberal left is not mainstream, Trebor.
0	If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food, why not spare pain and abort?	You have no idea whether the unborn will be 'unhappy', or even poor, for their lifetime.
0	that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran, mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni.  so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before(iraq) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat(aq) and unrelated nation.	well, latest word is that the alphabet soup is taking the threat seriously.
0	It doesn't make sense because no one makes that claim. There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution. That does not mean that evolution is random.	And the reason they say that -- one of them -- is that NS on the level of the population is random....which makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever.
1	So, a forty year old having sex with a twelve year old is ok then?	I suppose they are really asking for the minimum age of consentual age to be lowered/removed.
0	Did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.	You see all the straight people know that whatever ther gays get, they will want more..and you just proved it.
0	There are no objective reasons to condemn gays. Marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it.My advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions, believe me I have lost alot of support from conservatives for this, perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes.	And what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if I may ask?I'm assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably don't pertain to you well, cause your not gay....
1	if i were a virgin it wouldn't insult me that you called me such a meaningless terminology. ignoring that nonsensical 'insult', i shall simply call you a man-whore and move along. as for the answer to the question, i will ask you why you try so hard to contribute constructively to a website that rewards you with nothing. oh dear, man-whore, that 'virgin' just burst your ego, what will you ever do?	perhaps more the point is that you're too scared to ask yourself the question: 'why do i care so much about getting points for doing absolutely nothing on a site that gives me no reward?'
1	Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?	I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy.
0	Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago (a real cave, not one of the commercialized ones). Bats actually have better eyesite than humans, but even they can't see in pitch black. No eye can.	In my opinion, this guy is basically saying that if you had a bunch of bricks and mortar, a building could be built.
0	This is why the title is "God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle :)	So the definition that began this thread that God is identified as"the greatest being possible" must limit the possibilities to a finite number.As I write this I can see that it's self-evident - but what I can't see is howthis gets us any closer to showing that God exists (or not) !
0	They are safer. The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then.Let's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies. Only 13% of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them, Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30, and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack, with severe punishments for the seal being broken.	Recently liberals in Switzerland were successful in passing a mandate that militia members are no longer allowed to keep their service weapons and ammunition at home.They're no longer safe because of these pansies having their way.
1	Having politicians monitor their ethics is much like having the mafia monitor crime.	money .... Why do you think Congress is so reluctant to pass ethics bills?
1	Now I read this and thought there are two ways I could describe you:1) You are very poorly read in history.or2) Why don't you give a damn about the born? at what point does that defenseless little child become second in your concerns to the unborn?I'm intrigued, I really am.	Abortion is killing a defenseless, helpless, innocent baby in the womb....It is the most barbaric crime one human being can perpetrate on another
0	Lots of makers are still churning out lever action rifles. I am sad to see Winchester closed, but sad feelings is not a good financial reason to keep a poorly run company open.	The venerable Winchester line of guns is no more, despite a heroic two month effort to find a buyer.I have a hard time believing someone will not try to resurrect the name, but perhaps it's best to let it die away.
0	Heart bypass, prostate cancer.......I have a couple of Canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to Bellingham Wash and had the Surgery within 2 weeks............	What are you counting as critical?
1	I typically don't read Antonia's propaganda pieces, so is she holding up the UK as a shining example of dental health? If so, I suggest that she ask a typical Brit to smile, so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion. The US' "bubbas" have better teeth than the average Brit. emoticonXRolleyes	So baby how about those poor folks in Britain pulling their own teeth because of lack of healthcare?
0	Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?	There will be fewer of them PER INSURED.
0	Because it's a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it.	Just because 99% of scientists believe in evolution, why should I?
1	so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal?!?!? what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional? oh yeah, i forgot, the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want. so screw the will of the people, just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism.	that's in the last two years, not eight years ago, when the odious, unconstitutional prop.
0	'would the french accept people singing the la marseillaise in english as a sign of french patriotism? of course not,' there are so many flaws in this comparison it is unbelievable. firstly, there are virtually no french citizens for whom english is their first language. second, english isn't the national language of the us, nor is it a language that evolved there. a better comparison would be la marseillaise translated into bretagne, or translating 'oh canada' into french.	what i would like to know is when w, the 'decider', is going to learn english?
0	Do you believe that the freedom to not participate in any religion whatsoever is not covered by the expression "Freedom of Religion"?	Simone:Sorry, but that's not in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
0	We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead	There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try :p
0	it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes.	this is unsurprising to most rational folk, but yet we still hear the pro-gun clarion call to have no new gun laws, etc.
0	Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that "incipient organ" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying "what good is half a wing." Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does "fully functional" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.	(6) Natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds, but actually tends to preserve the present kinds, since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no "survival" value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning.
1	oh yeah, it's a real brain teaser. who would have thought it's possible for someone to have two parents?	wow, you actually butchered this brain teaser stripping it of all of it's purpose.
0	But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.	you see, the thing is that not everybody agrees with some of the theories that usually accompany evolution (including Big Bang, abiogenesis, etc) that try to answer the question "how come existence".
1	Excuse me?! Didn't AIDS started because your homies either ate or did the nasty with monkeys, thereby crossing the species boundary? What did it have to do with "da man"? And crime and poverty in Africa is also the white devil's doing? emoticonXConfused	AIDS, crime and poverty only started with the influence of whites trying to establish their culture in africa
0	Actually, this data point is perfectly meaningless.NONE of the other information (or the conclusions) presented in this talk require "26".If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No.A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors.	“An application of the present results to the [Milky Way] Galaxy yields one supernova per 26 (± 10 estimated error) years in very good agreement with the evidence from historical supernovae.” G.

1	Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, "....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically." you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence.	If grammatically meant "with proper grammar", then there would be no need to say "grammatically correct".
1	uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!	sure keep guns ok..., we will..., thanks..., but..., we were planning on keeping them even if you disapproved.
1	After Rump Limpballs and his XXXXX followers started calling me a "Feminazi", I was granted a license to call TeaBaggers TeaBaggers.	or does the simple mention of the term somehow convey some mystical argument defeating power?2: Regardless of how unsavory the means I don't think desperation prompted grave robbing equates to asking for a handout.

0	so you argue that for some women, abortion is the 'easy way out', and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? could you please reiterate these reasons here (preferably in an enumerated list) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? indeed. but we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.  so i'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?	1. i think a lot of women take take the easy way out when it comes to and abortion for the reasons i have stated over and over again.......... 2. what i said was it seems you can't pick up the newspaper these days and not see a case of where some woman has abandoned a new born baby in a trash can or dumpster.......it never use to be that way..........
1	The egg is now a conscious human? In under 72-hours? Wow.	You all are missing the point that the morning after pill is abortion (or rather could be).
0	And you believe that to be what? You really need to just say who/what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.	For the sake of discussion let's say it is the same one all the signers of the Declaration of Independence agreed it was.

1	I find it funny you think Article V was repealed yet the bill of rights references Article V for passage.   So we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but Article V which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? You've really lost it haven't you.	If you can repeal the BOR, any one of them there is nothing to stop you from repealing the Articles either is there?
0	I think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well. I think that is where the majority of this problem lies.

0	The same ones you've been told about, what, a few dozen times now? :)A small exerpt:	And what fossil records can you show that one species of animal has evolved into another species of animal?
0	False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself.	Any random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system.
1	Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.	For instance; they have many pages dedicated to the history, derivation and definition of the word "species".
0	So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?	The topic of this thread is "15 myths about gun control" But you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual...
1	It's also hard to convince a rational person that something is so if there is zero evidence of its truth, but then you wouldn't have any clue about that.	People have been trying for centuries.
0	well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.	So, in other words, you an intelligent actor weed out the programs that don't look like anything that resembles a living thing.
1	That's the difference between liberals and conservatives (AKA "real Americans.) Conservatives have a sense of humor. Liberals don't.	Something about it doesn't scan well - I think it's because the 'voice' isn't developed enough to make it sound absurd.

0	You do not have a right to drive. No one does. Driving is not a right. The state does not owe it to you to give you a license to drive. The activity of driving is a priveldge granted by the state, not a right.Rights are not regulated by government. You have them and no earthly authority can take it away from you. The state never gave me my rights, I already had them, nor do I have to ask for permission to exercise them.	What objective standard are you using to determine what I do and do not have a right to do?
1	wow, these are some very nice values, lets teach them to everyone else! if the bible says so, why not? you seem determined to debate about a book of flawed values. are you sure you are defending this book of it's values? because surely you must have some kind of religious point of view to even think of protecting a piece of old literature.	not to mention the child slaves... i've explained one times too many times why it's a sensible thing to do in ancient times.
1	Wait until Gen. Petraus' report comes out, then you'll eat those words. BTW, do you take ketchup or mustard with that? ;)	There is no chance of winning.

1	Modest as well I see. You haven't answered my question at all. If you are going to wander into a thread like this and make such a comment as follows:	I believe I am a man of high principles and moral values, now if you don't have any other questions of me can we get back on topic........I believe I have answered your question...........Thanks........
0	I believe in a strict interpretation of the Constitution, this makes me neither a liberal or conservative. The SN was inspired by VOR who kept signing his posts with quotes from Karl Marx.	a pro-gunner with the SN of "marxismismurder" conservative was a pretty safe bet.
0	actually, the only valid question plotter asked is about the existence of dinosaurs (How did they fit into the creation schedule?) Good question plotter...Plotter: "when did he create all the other planets, when did he create all the other stars and comets?"Gen. 1:14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so. and XQ, what stories are you talking about?	Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize (lie) what God actually did, for God was done with everything then started again.
1	What facts? The article above your post is replete with documented facts. Are you in denial? Have you even read the article? Are all of your responses knee-jerk, shoot-from-the-hip defense mechanisms?Pay attention.	I see more whining on the Conservative side then the libral side.
0	Are those thousand people directly and immediately threatening to rape you, to kill you? Up close and personal? I will retain my right to self defense. I bet you would, too.	If killing were an act of justice I could take upon myself, I would probably kill about a thousand people already.
0	Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers? That's a statement of faith.	In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there is nothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science.
0	Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree. Correlation is not causation.	What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates.
0	So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning!	Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights.

0	So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence.	So what activates genes?When a gene product is needed, a signal from its environment, not an emergent property of the gene itself, activates experession of that gene.
0	i am familiar with both men; and my posts sound very lockean, which if you really knew locke you would know is true. remember previously in this thread (that is, when you were travelling these parts as 'bhbcu64') where i said that there is no right to control one's body? or where i said there is no right to suicide? that is locke 101.	matthew, though i doubt phyllis is aware of either man, her posts sound more like rousseau than locke.
0	Not entirely true. While we can't disprove that God created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. For example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old.	The reason for that is, that Creationism can never be proved or disproved.
0	gitmo is a media darling. nobody talks about abu ghraib. and it is still in operation see what the obama admin thinks about closing that one. not a fucking word. enjoy the grandstanding.	gitmo' i happen to think closing a camp that engaged in torture and the prolonged detainment of 'terrorists' without trial was one of his best choices so far.
0	?? What are you trying to say?Science is knowledge, all knowledge, that is, anything we find to be true. There is no other "truth" out there, if there were, we'd be omniscient.	This is their words as nothing science has "proven" overturns anything the Bible says.
0	Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.	Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly.

Consider rape, murder, incest and sodomy as good historical examples of such taboo activities, taken by you as an inditement of all gay people JSD ? You seem to take any moral stance or argument I make very personally, as if I'm accusing you of being those things. You work very hard to read into, demonize and condemn everything I say as if it is intended as a personal attack. You really need to work on that.	And you wonder why "bigot and homophobe" come up so much in response to your posts?
1	Some slightly earlier history shows that Clinton wasn't quite that worried about Bin Laden. In 1996, the CIA had Bin Laden pinpointed on a ranch in Afghanistan. It needed permission ONLY from the Clinton White House (not Congress) to vaporize it - it was in the middle of nowhere. An official from the "United Arab Emirates" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!	President Bill Clinton was very worried about Osama bin Laden well before 9/11 and HE GAVE EXPLICIT WARNINGS ABOUT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND TERRORISM TO GEORGE WALKER BUSH AND HIS PEOPLE DURING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIONS.
1	yes. your point? have you? as poor a typist as i am, and as full of mis-spellings as most of my posts are that is the best you can do? i must be slipping.	have you been to nigeria???
0	I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few.	Heh, well we'll see how long they can do it.
1	Steeeeve?Do yourself a favor and stop fantasizing about my opinion, 'mmkay?I don't believe you are like that.This junk you do where you refuse to address what I DO say and make up strawman arguments gets you nowhere...I understand you're getting angry, but YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...Let me repeat that. Hopefully it will sink in?YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...With that said, I return you to your delusions...	You know, your comments make me and probably symbiote angry.
0	really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?	i think you've been reading too much george orwell, you've come up with new speak for science.
1	Not only is everyone in agreement, which scares me enough, but Parcum even agrees with me. This is really shocking!!!! :)	They obviously didn't help us at all.
0	my dear, i can see the wood for the trees. no-one expects perfect parents, but no parent should dictate school policy. and this guy was a bad example.	maybe you should subtitle this thread: the right to a school with perfect parents.
1	i love how scumbarge doesn't give a rebuttal to this. he knows you have him by the balls.	why don't you post what they have said, since, apparently you have and must (therefore) know where to look to find it ;)
0	I wouldn't say most cjurches, because you cannot prove that. There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks.	Joe, this is no surprise....This Pope is a very conservative one and like it or not the Roman Catholic church and most churches believe the sexual act that gays commit a sin as they would any other sin.........The church believes love the sinner but hate the sin..........That will never change my friend
1	no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!	to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that?
1	You're somehow right despite the fact that all reliable evidence is on our side? What idiocy.	just because its broken doesnt mean Im wrong.
1	And here it is, corrected to remove that little hint of sensationalism that you feel is needed to drum up support for your cause.	Pictures of aborted babies (Warning: Graphic content - do not click on the link if you think you might be offended):
0	And this is a terrific breakthrough. My partner and I are coveered by my company's health insurance, and the state of Connecticut honors our Civil Union. That being said, I still have to pay tax on my partner's health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union.So it has to be marriage. Full and without exception.Civil Unions are not enough when we are treated differently under the law.	I am now covered under my partner's state sponsored (he's a state worker) health insurance.
1	###!! You're seriously advocating allowing kids to take guns to school? Don't you have enough greiving parents already without giving kids the option to shoot out a disagreement?	Gun Free School Zones ActThere's nothing reasonable about this law, this law has even made it possible for the worst school massacres of the 20th and 21st centuries to take place, by ensuring all the victims couldn't shoot back.
1	And yet after investigating for over a year, our inspectors agree with me, not you. Hmmm.	Anyone with an iota of common sense knows that he had them, he used them and he hid them.The problem is that you are a complete XXXXX.
1	But what makes them any different from ant hills or beaver dams? skyscrapers are natural because humans are a part of nature and they built them.	There are many man-made substances that are not found in nature at all.
1	I don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one.	How many people would be capable of doing that to themselves?
1	Sorrowfully, you are so right. That's exactly why we have all "suffered" for 8 long years. Sheer. . . . .no I refuse to write it!! :)	I would bet if we required a satisfactory score on a politcal knowledge test to vote for our leaders, we would see an entirely new crop of politicians in Washington.
0	personally i can't stand it when someone uses 'lol'. it's usually used derisively when politeness suggests that leaving it out and responding politely is in order. personally i'm surprised at this thread. the author apparently didn't read the faq.	when you start substituting u for you and r for are you just look stupid, but everyone seems to understand and use lol frequently.
0	The human collective is the authority. One major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.	this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air
1	why would you think such an absurd concept. corporations don't cast a vote in an election do they? why not?  does a corporation have a mind of it's own that it may look to it's interests in it's attempts to influence legislation? no, it permits individuals to overcome finance laws and exercise greater influence than is normally permitted for an individual. should your car have rights? you pay a tax for it. how about your house? pay a tax for that also every year.	if that's the case, then we should alsdo eliminate corporate taxes and only have 'natural persons' pay taxes since corporations would be taxed without representation.
1	Ok, so you utterly missed the whole religion vs. faith part of the discussion, got it.	it takes faith to believe that a complex organ such as a pancreas or an eye could arise from randomness..
1	I see -- in your opinion is it is "illegitimate", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance.	It is a right that has been interpreted by Courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process.
0	The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)	the laws of logic are non-material, universal, unchanging, and absolute
1	Did I mention premarital or adulterous heterosexual sex?  I think not!  As usual 'big' boy is putting words in others posts!  Was better when I was on his ignore list..for about five minutesemoticonXConfused	so, premarital heterosexual sex is not a sin.
1	ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation.	good grief, to suggest that the god who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is, frankly, as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the bible that condones, allows, or supports any and every abortion that occurs.
1	Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.	Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it.
0	And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother.	It's much easier to sit and say, "don't have an abortion" than to stand up and say "here's how I will help you so you don't have to have an abortion".
0	I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child.I fully intend to have children in the future, including through adoption possibly. When I do I will love them with all my heart and put their needs above my own. I'm not going to do a half-assed job of parenting; I'll give it 100%.But not yet.Prototype:	If you can feel nothing remorseful from having your baby killed at all, then I pity the children you raise.
0	Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read.	In regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer.
1	i doubt you know enough about carl bogus speedy defense of bellesiles and his dependance on a flawed study by loftin which was also in turn defended by jack rakov who later apologized out of embarrasment? want to take a shot and drag this farther off topic and embarrass yourself and star gazer and any other adherents? you well know you are in the wrong ballpark as has been pointed out many times on this very board. keep clutching at straws you will never get enough to build that strawman. beating a dead horse is bad enough...all 9 justices agreed the right was individual in heller.	'[92] the result was a single sentence with a clarifying preamble: 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
1	There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value.	How pathetic they are not to appreciate that with all of the value and potential they see in themselves, that at one time they were exactly like these unborn children with the same mental existence they now claim is justification for their extermination.
1	How about he pulls it out from under the Ramadan tree and unwarps it rather than your Hitler Youth moment?	Sort of like him taking you to the DMV to get your driver's license.
0	There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out.	It means that as our medical technology has gotten progressively better, and a premature baby can survive outside the womb at earlier and earlier stages because of this, the point at which it is unethical and/or considered murder has gotten earlier.
1	i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin? if he is god, no one had to die for anything. he could blink his eyes and everything would be as he wanted!	god wants you to come to him, but on his terms, not yours.
0	Or that they tend to be better prepared, or even less willing to accept help from others or get breakdown cover. That's the trouble with these kind of stats, the interpretations are pretty open to debate.	Or just nicer people?
0	And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?	Or by not granting them to the child you are endangering the rights of the child carried by the woman.
1	i'm surprised to learn that you have the slightest idea about biology. also, your spelling and grammar is ever so much better in this post than your posts in another thread. how many of you are pretending to be a poster named vt?	a little lesson in biology told me that when the sperm meets the egg, it makes a zygote... that means that fertilization has occured... which means a life has begun (even the medical field and our government agree with this).
1	This, coming from an atheist. How consistently shallow of you. emoticonXRolleyes	Normal people can be spiritually fulfilled without any need for a co-dependent relationship with a "god".
1	I have. Yet I can`t seem to be able to do the creative math that will show that europe will become pre-dominatly muslim in any near future.	All one needs to do is to check the demographic data.
1	yes let's all cheer on the glorified shameless point-farming bitch of this site.	well this is nice to come back to- jc making serious debate.
0	Actually, my wife and I discuss evolution all the time. She's an evolutionary biologist. She did feel as if she had some duty to watch the show, just to stay on top of the sorts of things being said. She just has a low tolerance for willful stupidity. Which I totally understand. :)	LOL Kronus - my wife and I don't sit around the dinner table debating evolution either, she was shocked that people could be so intentionally ingnorant and zealous, supposedly in the name of Christianity.
0	No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se.	Just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world, doesn't mean that it is 100.00% certain, just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00% (say, 99.9999999%).
0	Well, it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material. That's rather impressive. Again, irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution, regardless of you trying to create that association. Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated, well that only shows one thing, namely that you are dishonest.	and some people were saying "They are just that close in showing how life could come from non-life."
0	Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?	This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce.
0	No it didn't, there's no suggestions for how to enforce background checks to stomp out straw purchases. Stop offering non-solutions.	Not if it were enforced and a suggestions for how the law could be better enforced are given in the report.
1	Anyone can "give consent". The issue is wether the parson is old enough to make that decission. I bet the children Michael Jackson raped gave their consent. Does that make it "allright"? Are the kids "mature enough" to take the consequences of those actions?	I'm not going to say "oh, well since the girl who got pregnant is still very young she should have an abortion", because if she gave her consent to having sex then she should be old enough and mature enough to having a child.
1	oh really? then please provide me with several links that prove i'm an idiot or shut the fuck up! considering you only have 30 points i'm not too sure just how much you could possible know about anyone on this site? come on dude! you're a troll and everyone knows it... stop your trolling, grow up and hang with the big dogs... if you can't then close your fucking troll account and go bye bye.	after looking at your posts, i'm not sure intelligence is gonna be your best argument... although, once the window came up i at least had the wherewithal to make sure my position was correct - ie - support = pencil and tag = pencil rather than say i support pencil in one and pen in the other...
1	oh yes those horrible wicked gays that will distroy families and consume morality as we know it.	everyone except those wicked, godless gays, naturally.
1	Anything that doesn't fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong?	So the article is of no use in drawing the aformentioned conclusion that homosexual couples are more monogamous than heterosexual ones, or vice-versa.
0	i think the the p. bagatti is the one that found the burial caves in 1873, not the bagatti who was working in the mid 40's. i have unable to get a copy of the original manuscript the leadership u describes. i think it is only in italian though. i am surprised that such a  'key discovery' from the 19th century is kept so quiet except by claims of an evangilical web site.	i suspect the author may have meant to say 'b.
0	Used against me? I never denied this. Surely you refer to this in terms of gay marriage. Considering I don't believe gay marriage is a right I don't see how my words do you any good.	What you say will be used against you.
1	she was never 'pro-gun' to you people. she was an anti. omg they reported on something. not exactly ready to help her reputation out before she was shot, though, were they? you have lots of bros that are lunatics. and one of them just shot and murdered 6 people, including a federal judge who was sitting on an immigration case and a congresswoman who opposed to arizona's immigration law. arizona: your land of cowgirl jan and cowboy sheriff joe.  i never heard of anyone who truly understood what a soul was, who thought they didn't need a mirror. i'm not surprised you think yourself at the level of god himself, able to judge who has a soul and who doesn't. it's the same psychology your bro with a gun just demonstrated.	what would we need with one when there's nothing wrong with our souls?
0	But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]	Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human.
0	Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said "minimal or negligable physical damage".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the "peg" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.	Are you sure about that?
0	The thing is the Dempski didn't provide any kind of testable or detectable definition about what information is either. He used vague but scienficially sounding terms to push his case. He knew it too.	Dempski uses information theory which uses log base 2 to support his claims about intelligent design.
1	Ah yes, your diversionary tactics. I am sure if I provided it, you would move the goal posts, or demand evidence that you know is not yet available.. So, since this thread is about Jesus, and if a 'historical' Jesus actually existed, where is your evidence besides religious articles, forgeries, and accounts taken from Christians?What?? No where to be found?? Gasp.	If you can't cough him up you'd better get a new mindset about what's going on in the universe.
1	Public policy? Takes waaaay too much thought. Now one can go to ballpark here and pay $8.50 for a half pound hot dog, smothered in thick layers of chili, cheese and grilled onions (2,200 calories, 55 grams of saturated fat, 1,600 milligrams of sodium). That's a no-brainer (literally).  Dono	the publics way too busy with important issues such gaining weight at fast food joints and spreading christian hypocrisy.
0	Then for you, you made the right decision at the time. I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child.	Yes, I certainly did consider these risks, and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion.
1	Because the gay personals are full of married straight men looking for discrete gay sex	What on earth makes you think that a gay men could succeed in seducing a straight man, and a lesbian could seduce a straight woman.Of course there always are exceptions.
1	I didn't think you had either the intellectual or logical ability to respond. :)	OK, take the quotation marks off the word insignificant and answer the question.
0	IF! But here's the thing, Mexico is making absolutely no attempt to truly stomp out the drug cartels, they're catering to them! Various political figures and police officers are on the take, they're getting massive amounts of bribe money from the cartels, stopping them would prove detrimental.	Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?
1	sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want.	just out of curiosity, please pick out your best one (just one, your best one) alleged contradiction from the gospels and let me see if it holds up to close scrutiny.
0	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will	So you do have free will to make your own choices, but God must "approve" those choices.
1	if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said.	so lets get this straight; you say it is fine to pick and choose which bits of the bible you accept, but it is not okay to try revisit passages in the light of other knowledge from outside the bible?
0	Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.	But for the sake of clarification can you tell me if you believe it possible that the rights of the being's inside the mother are being infringed upon?
1	Are you telling me liberals have jobs? You sure can't tell it by all the anti military/war protests, the flag burnings, you saw prior to the start of the war and by all the libs that post here 24/7........They are either unemployed or 12 year old kids out of school for summer vacation..........	Have you considered that there are some Liberals, who are retired from their jobs ?
0	would you cite the exact article for once in your life? i'm sick of seeing the main page day after day after day.	a full embassy is not expected, but it will be the first official u.s. prensence 1979. the announcement is scheduled for after the november election.
0	But the number of criminals that have firearms can be reduced. In developed nations that have very strict gun laws there are a lot less criminals obtaining and using guns to commit crimes. How does your theory explain that?	I've been saying this for years...Criminals have always had guns ban or notThat is the exact point of this thread... guns bans/control doesn't stop the criminals, endangering the populace.If you want to argue anti-gun... don't support the side of us "redneck-hillbilly-gunnuts" that you think are so stupid.
0	so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?	Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.
1	Not nearly as tired as the "YOU can't live like that because it is against MY religion" argument. Hell, that one pre-dates Christianity!	The tired old 'you can't eat seafood' argument attempting to try to justify illicit gay sex sin.
1	hey i just aked a question ....... you think im evil , how would your mum have felt reading half the shit that comes out of your mouth. pfht fuck you darling. oh and i love you.	how can you tell a man that about his mum??!!!
0	I have noticed he seems content to drop a Ad Hominem neglecting to actually argue.	TQ doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that I don't.
1	That's what's known around here as a lie, and I wish you were capable of feeling ashamed of yourself.	See my previous posts on this.
0	Out-and-out lie. There's really no other way to put this.	How, despite centuries of artificial breeding and decades of experiments, no one has ever observed one species turn into another ("speciation")
1	I'm not going anywhere with this thread. I just wanted to point out the obvious hypocrisy of everything your side represents, and nothing more. You all go right ahead and massage your shallow World views.	Certainly not from biblical accounts emoticonXDonno But I am not about to turn this thread into an platform for where you are trying to go.
1	so you want to try it as a demonstration? i thought not. claims are easy to make but you have produced no evidence but words and only fiction to present.  yep, it is almost there per 100,000. meanwhile, your nation is rising by leaps and bounds and innocent people are being convicted to protect criminals. even dan rather commented on u.k. crime being much worse than any place in america. there is a reason for that....	like i said that's why criminals would have more motivation to shoot an armed citizen.
0	Actually, I don't ask how the idea occurred. As I mentioned, Darwin suggested it. I'm not sure what the rese of that paragraph means.	2) Then u might ask, how did the idea of ape becoming human occured?
0	I think the FSM threw these guys a bone. They cherrypicked which taxa would give them the most statistically significant results. If they were to expand the method to include more and more taxa, they'd see the Noodly Appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Ramen.	“We thought that the idea itself was important, that this is a really powerful approach to a very major question,” said Funk, “but we thought there was no way in the world that we were actually going to get statistically significant results.” The reason for his doubt was the incompleteness and lack of uniformity of ecological data.
0	And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?	It destroys NATO's higher death rate "argument", and proves my point.California = "toughest gun laws" = 9.8 gun deaths per 100,000 population.Florida = lax gun laws = 11.1 gun deaths per 100,000 population.emoticonXRolleyes
1	So now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?   I expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? Am I to believe that you are a soldier there now?   Your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. I posted exactly what I meant to and you went off on a tangent. I asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if "show me yours before I show mine?" Pitiful.	If you had a rational thought on the subject, I would respond to this statement, but I won't even dignify your ramblings with a second thought.
0	Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.	No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns.
0	Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment, and how much gun control is legally allowed. Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.I see absolutely no comparison between the two.	In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with.

0	JFriday:In fairness, no one, pro or ant-gun can ever use UK stats to support thier argument again. Back in Jan '03 the UK government finally came clean and announced that they had been seriously fu**ing with crime statistics.You can make the argument that the UK state had something to hide with guncontrol and you would probably be right. Reliable information from UK ministries should now be accepted as less than credible.	You are really going to hurt for that statement.WHERE ARE YOUR STATS BACKING THAT UP?!?!?!
0	that's just darling, and all. but it still doesn't indicate that a fetus is a small person. no one denies it's alive. no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens. no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person, which is the simplistic point of that cloying article. it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate. i don't think it can ever be definitively determined.  using dr. seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument, however. i am not sure why you quoted shooter's post about a death sentence. however, if you really equate abortion with murder, are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder?	a person is a person no matter how small.

The transcript shows that he did not ask her anything in the Gay marriage section of the discussion.Transcript can be found here: http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/pr...al-debate.htmland here: http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/...ipt/index.html (click on the same-sex benefits section and the transcript shows up right next to the video)	The difference that is being pointed out in the article you quoted is this: Biden DID clearly say he believed gay couples should have equal rights when it came to things like hospital visitation, insurance, etc.

0	Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.	(if anything it says life starts at birth with the first breath)

0	I believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions. So why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response?	Some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed.
0	So ban guns? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head. Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately. Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database. I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime.	In these transactions, the purchaser is not required to pass a background check so how can the seller be sure whether or not the buyer has a criminal history?
0	sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well.	humans are sexual beings, they have sex (something some posters may understand some day if he ever have sex) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precautions.
0	Making up numbers again georged? Care to post some links to this data?In 2005 Israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. As for the 28 billion in 2002...I know that is wrong. I recall a 200 million dollar thing, but I don't know if it went through.The rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so.	Pull those numbers from their primarily transactional GDP and problems would quickly appear cumulating with that spiral effect.
1	Only in the mind of a secular humanist atheist would it make sense. emoticonXGood	Wow, let's see what happens when we change a single word:Now there, doen't that make so much more sense?
0	And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the "genuineness" of ~2000 year old manuscripts...	Isn't it amazing how quickly creationists will accept natural selection and superfast evolution when it supports they're beliefs?
0	i agree. hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money, with the size of government, with foreign relations, with underage pages, with the military in general, with privacy, civil rights or even the most basic function of congress: oversight.  liberalism needs to be evicted from congress, therefore the republicans need to go.  it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans. democrats more conservative then republicans? well..given how far republicans have gone over i can't say i'm surprised.	the fact that america needs a republican congress is evidenced by the past records of the two major parties.
1	wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. finally you are cheering for the correct side. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again. it is funny how many of you religious people are so sure of your faith, but can't stand to see other people talk about how observable data doesn't fit with it.	personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again.
0	Except in the Dred Scott case the court wasn't trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right, or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery.	By your logic, when the Supreme Court ruled that African Americans were not citizens and that they were not entitled to protection by the Constitution in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) people should have just shut up and moved on.

1	is this the pro-sodomite woman talking here? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be?  where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. one more time now, preppy: where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. so go preach that trash to someone who's buying it.	i actually feel sorry for him and pity him he can not see jesus in another human being and is so addicted to the bible, and the teachings of the false god paul, that he and his kind have made it their god.
1	Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't "really" a christian.	Once again, my point was that evolutionists contradict each other.

1	but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing. doesn't it. so you think that just because you enter a debate half-way, you can still give an uninformed opinion? weren't you the one ready to laugh at me? i won't laugh at you. i am only saddened by your personal attacks. yes, repeating yourself. i know what they say, you know what they say. i don't agree with them, on these points. answers in genesis are 'right' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being 'selective' in the information we use; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes. i disagree with them. do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution? i bet you've been very selective here too!	i see you still think my goal in life is to go back and read every post you ever made.
1	Just because you fail to realize what the article says doesn't make what you said true. Since you seem to like logical fallacies can you reconginze which one you just committed?	I really hate having to beat a dead horse more the once.
1	You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?	Did your thought process ever include the question: What choice does the "victim" have?
1	No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure.	Isn't that 'cells producing something other than what they are'?
1	And once again (s)he rambles on while responding to nothing said in the prior post. At least you're consistent in your irrational hate speech. BTW, the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all.

Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off.	Come to that... given that all humans start out as a single cell, that's definitely false.

1	Right on! The Obama administration is a colossal financial disaster. If he doesn't have another trillion dollars to XXXX he can't do anything. Tax and spend - that's all those liberal turkeys know how to do.	You're right, how silly of me to think that Democrats or this buffoon of a President would have anything to do with a BUDGET PLAN or even present a comprehensive budget; they have failed to do so now since 2008.Another illustration of the massive failure of leadership the Democrat Party and this President represent.
1	So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?  The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.  It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.	toxic gases, giant ash clouds, thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there's anything approaching an eruption, it's not a pretty picture.
1	Did you go to college, Trebor? You might want to look up how "pedophilia" is spelled. LOL!! Then you can go have a beer with Orion and watch his head swivel.	I can well believe Orion saying that you used a source that said the Rabbi's condoned pedaphilia, and denied the holocaust.

0	mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?	or have i got the wrong end of the stick and you think that we are discovering things closer to the truth and the stories are just a primative culture trying to work out how the world is as it is.
1	but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm...	i think if there is a god and it's anything like i picture, you'll be fine.
1	Wow, you are high on Christ...Scary...I haven't seen this addiction up close emoticonXRolleyes	For your info, and as I stated before, this world will not last much longer in its current state.
1	let's say that the law, based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data, decides that some folks are inferior to other folks, and thus less of a person? you know, if the law said 'because you are black, you are less of a person than shomeone who is white. you shouldn't be upset though, all scientific data suggests that you, because you are black, are truly inferior to those who are white.' would you think, because the law said so, that a black person was in fact a non-person?	the law can treat the late term fetus as a person because it has developed to the point where sentience is verifiable.
1	They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world.	I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature.
0	No it doesn't. That's why Darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory. Those who don't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand. Fittness is not a reference to big and strong. It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.I'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.You've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong.	Of those that are beneficial, the chance of actually being passed on is minimal considering the animal bearing that mutation has to actually be the biggest strongest animal to pass on its genes - unless it is lucky.
1	lol bias dysfunctions. i'm surprised you know such a long word. pity you don't know what it means. i can't blame you... being a retarded ignorant white woman. you don't even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs. go back to cleaning the house. worse is that you don't work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but don't pay taxes. you're better how?	pity you have not figured me out beyond your own bias dysfunctions , then you would hear the tone in my voice for what it is when i type it.

1	And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....	Must simply be a matter of time...Honestly, Those arguments are totaly worthless.Compare the rate of criminality and murders in US and those of the average contries with gun-bans.

1	yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!	no one knows anything about the constitution so how do they make claims that abortion is constitutional?
0	Apples and oranges. We're not demanding that they have abortions either.	Slave owners weren't demanding people own slave, simply that they had the option.
1	were it so simple. for the agents to 'freely assemble' among us they, or their superiors, must conclude that we are some sort of threat. would that make you feel loved? on a side note, i'm always surprised at how 'conservatives', normally so worried about government waste, take such a waste of taxpayer dollars so glibly. fbi investigating kiss-ins? joining subversive 'terrorist' xxxx biker groups?	if they're just hanging around amongst the minions, that's perfectly legal and not spying.

0	i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager.	the thoughtful atheist, full of skepticism but fearful of the possibility of the existence of god and a day of judgement, may wish to consider the prayer of the skeptic, as follows: o lord--if there is a lord, save my soul--if i have a soul.
1	i'm shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic.	a large amount of people disagree with you and you act 'shocked' at how that could be possible?
1	That is an interesting fact, how come I have never heard such a thing..maybe a link is in order and not a stormfront or the like link please....actually I have listened to gangsta rap...Easy E, Snoop, NWA, and so many others, in fact they are in my truck right now.. imagine a redhead "whitey" takes enjoyment in listening to all kinds of music.. hmm I also have Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Nat King Cole, and while we are at it I have music that I adore from Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Turkey and so many I cant list them all... whats your point?I would hardly call rap the decay of the 90's, apparently a lot of people listen if they are making money....I wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past? Maybe that would explain a lot.	What i really find disturbing is why you choose to ignore truths and facts....did you know that the blacks that were brought here from Africa were the criminal and the mentally deranged?

1	On the bright side, it appears that the Rapture will solve the Social Security financing problem...	Err, no correction necessary, I just felt like saying Enrapture.No the dooms-day will not be on the arrival of the asteroid, that has nothing to do with it, the dooms-day event will be a terrible event, even for the innocents, wrong on both accounts.
0	No, neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. Legality and morality are completely separate things.	Are you suggesting that legal makes moral?
0	Logically incorrect. One can as many red balls as one likes, and still only have one green one.	If it's all that endless and limitless, there would have to be an endless, limitless number of planets exactly like this one.
0	Yet it is the only source I've seen that counted the incedents in which a gun was used in self-defence, but nobody was injured. I could assume that all of your sources and Ians only count occasions where one was injured. According to the source, they'd 91.7% of all times where a gun was used in self-defence.	But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves.
0	But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins.	We need to teach kids how to think, and unfortunately, ID doesn't seem to deal with thinking.
1	Proof for a non-event? What century did your purported non-event supposedly occur, Einstein?	And yet you spiritually challenged turkeys still can't provide proof that there is no resurrected Krishna.
1	you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright. 'sickening' is a good way to put it.	yet organized religion forces it's followers to do just that, to not question authority, pooh-pooh science, and never think for themselves let alone following their hearts.
0	See above. A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence. Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked, rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in.	As said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place, so their effectiveness is highly questionable.
0	I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification.	No, it is you young padawan learner... that has been mislead, some of the most famous and noted Darwinian Naturalists such as Crick, Huxley, Lipson... and others have admitted to their own discredit that the entire theory of evolutions rests on chance, here... but here, lets burst that bubble for you a bit more:
1	No. What the doctor was doing was going to church. He was not a monster. He was not a "sicko." He was a murder victim.   What his murderer did was murder.	It wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.
1	Not the same thing at all! Most gay pride floats are moade of crate paper and glue guns. Not gold. I think you have stratched this one really far. Nice try, thanks for playing. Try again soon! Wow, nicotine cravings make me a mean person!	I'm sure all the money for decorations, supplies, and city services for gay pride parades down through the years would go a long ways toward it too--what's your point?
0	So have I, since I know that evolution has and does take place. But I catch it from both sides because I don't believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness.	I have actually been called a heathen because I believe in evolution.
1	never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming.	you totallly made up that there was some 'other speech' pushing a 'socialist agenda.'
0	Why do you oppose gay marriage? The traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride. The wedding is what is sacred. What you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well. You have no valid reason to oppose it either.	If someone is opposed to gay marriage and does not dislike gays or fear them, just not wanting to extend marriage to gays they would not be a homophobe.One can be opposed to gay marriage and not intensely dislike gays or fear them.
1	but do you ever question it for your self? or are you content to just show up .. and let someone else tell you what it all means. the rcc has made , by their own admission, mistakes in the past are you suggesting that it won't happen again? are you suggesting they never made a mistake in their interpitation of the bible? if so you might want to tell that to gallileo remember him ? he was burned at the stake for telling the rcc that the earth went around the sun!	the rcc has priests and i follow its teaching as set down by jesus christ through his first pope his disciple peter.............
0	Right. They can never show how the belief in their deity is not a textbook case of the special pleading fallacy. (Pretty funny after all the hubbub earlier about double standards...)	Let's see you show that the God that you believe in is that God.. and that this God even exists outside the imaginations of the mind?
1	So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?	If you have no interest, then why on earth are you even here to debate?Besides this, you're trying to put killing human beings on the same platform as animals or organic plant life.
1	oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?	however, i do not place confidence in scientists.
1	How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?	Monkeys don't generally have problems with their private parts being functional.
1	So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?	It's also a natural, orderly process that plays out possible variations on a theme, making the organism not inherently stupid and clueless, but more like a creative artist.
1	So you advocate religion not because it is the truth, but instead because it gives you comfort and security? The opiate of the masses eh?	How sad it would be for me if I believed that this is all there is.........When you die there is nothing else.........I truly believe that a lot of atheists find religion on their deathbed...........At least I hope that is the case............
0	I think you are entirely correct. From the page VOR linked:	I think it's nonsense interpretation developed by people who were afraid that if they fought for guns as valiantly as they did for free speech, they wouldn't receive any donations.
0	Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, "the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God," and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God?	It's a false dichotomy that some critics of religion have cast religion in by saying that submitting to spiritual authority and thinking/reasoning are going to be juxtaposed.
0	i just love how you call it a baby and not 'contents of the uterus' or 'product of conception' or 'fetus'. the truth is, that was a child.	steve, nobody was saying that you have to give 100% of yourself to your cause or otherwise you don't really believe in it.
0	I think you need to answer the same question I asked the other guy, who is God?	Or maybe it really was god that envolved from the apes.
1	Oh . . . please be gentle with me. Whew! :p	I'll be gentle with you and assume that you simply misinterpreted my statement.
0	Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under "evolution" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose "science" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea.	plus there are so many other sciences that are lumped with evolution,
1	Alexander, I don't give a rat's rectum about King James. emoticonXBanghead	I've lost track of what we're arguing about here.Are we arguing about Alexander or James I?Are we arguing about whether they were bisexual or homosexual, either one of those two or both of them, or which one?
1	Poor little poopie.   If your gay sex agenda wasn't of the devil himself you might be better received in the world.	Good way to prove exactly what I am talking about christianists and these dominionists in particular want to oppress gay people.
0	Your partner wouldn't happen to be a guy, would he? As for your Christian friend, ask her to join the fray. I'd like to ask her a few questions, such as:Who do you say Jesus Christ is? If not Lord, God, Savior, and Jewish Messiah then she is on the wrong page.Ask her if people need Jesus Christ for redemption for their sins?Ask her if people should repent of their sins and turn from them?Ask her who the Holy Spirit is? If not God, then she's on the wrong page (note Acts 5).Ask her if the Bible doesn't say gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.)? Those will do for starters.	She is a christian but she doen't share your beliefs.
0	ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out.	i don't think the mechanisms are in place in our justice system to have a trial for the dead, so we can only look at the evidence in the cases that people have privately pursued.
0	Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.	as i have told mathew s on numerous occasions, you are free to put forth an initative, in your state, to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages.
0	So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?	You could put it in the form of a resolution, in the debate challanges forum.
1	spoken like someone truly out of touch with reality. how long has it been since you were in high school? because if it hadn't been so long you'd know that short of coming to school in a banana suit (maybe not even then), kids could give two sh*ts about what other kids are wearing.	they eliminate the need for competition between the pupils to come to school with the most expensive ' cool' clothingthus reducing the strain on the parents' pockets.
1	maybe he'll unban himself on the third day (or was that three days and three nights...)	).Remember when Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross, and all kinds of people said things like, "He who saved others, come down off the cross and save yourself, so that we might believe" (that's a paraphrase).
0	now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is.	and lest you make a foolish claim, allow me to point out that the fact that you personally don't like how something is changing does not mean that's it's been harmed.
1	i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented.	only 15.1%... so that means that 276 men (51 senate/ 225 congress) will be needed just to pass a law that has to do with a women's body...and if its something that could be bad for a woman and/or unfairly good for a man then they can get no where near the amount of senators/representatives needed to supress it.... [66.6666-15.1 = 51.56666--(535/100)(51.56666)=276]  (http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/of...rs/cawpfs.html)
1	i love how you are pro-choice until its a choice you don't like. let people carry guns in their own home. let them carry it on their person. it has nothing to do with you does it not? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy.	nevermind my observation that left to your own devices, days go by where you either follow up your own posts or pat each other on the back as you regurtitate canned anti-gun control rhetoric.

1	And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am. However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice. Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment.	I didn't have to CHOOSE to be heterosexual.
0	I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it.	Factor in the explicitly advertised intentions of the I.D movement and related sites such as AIG, and it's not hard to pick a winner.

1	No need for further evidence why this law would be dangerous to those who do not think exactly like you do!

In fact, the word isn't found in any popular dictionary what so ever. It's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all. I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever.

0	we do......most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time. For example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other "ancient" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand. Of course evolutionists will come back and claim "erosion" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called "Hidden Archeology" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the "wrong" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false.	If Literal Creationism is indeed true, why do we not find strata with species from all eras mixed together?
0	So? In your religion's view, everyone sins. Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours.	Leviticus 18:22 "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."

Not to mention that it proved the unintelligence of creationists (as well as their predictive abilities, which, I must say are very poor).	Like juveniles, you are so easily impressed.
1	Plenty. You haven't noticed how many "sentences" you post that aren't sentences?	How many of us do you know who type in broken English?
0	That interpretation is fine except that God says, "I WILL make a helper suitable for him." He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.	Okay, here is how it went: God made the animals.
1	Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.	The book "Icons of Evolution" details the original experiment and the resultant controversy over the fraudulant findings.
0	how many animals do you think were on the Ark? how many species existed at the time?      the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23	Thought I'd start a new thread dedicated to this myth..
0	yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected.	after all, if what you claim is true, human beings have no choice but to 'devolve.'

0	i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught.	considering that there's little new information and reasoning in any of these debates, i find it surprising that they keep coming up.

0	Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.	how is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ?
0	No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance.	Meaning, I take it, pure chance, accident, or just plain 'luck'.
0	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.	then surely you can't explain away why enzyme a and co-enzyme b are separate compounds but work together to produce another by-product.

0	ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?	the independence of the church of england may have started with henry, but anglicanism is more correctly dated from elizabeth.

1	Oh, oh, and don't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment's text, which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions, in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state.

0	Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that "UK will be Islamic", "Sharia Law for UK" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly "taking over" )."muslims are taking over the world" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!

1	I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state.	It deals with the death penalty...really the court is one vote away from getting rid of it because some liberal judges don't like it.
0	No, we shouldn't abolish every flawed system. However, when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death, it is not worth the risk.In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois, there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death. I think that constitutes a serious problem.	Does that mean that we should abolish every system?
0	persecution on political grounds? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here. he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption (bribing politicians) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin. now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government...and he lays all this out to a british newspaper.  political persecution if he returns? probably not. execution for treason? that one seems more likely.  in the extradition rhetoric arena, the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british.	the british refusal to return boris berezovsky to russia, is because he has been granted refugee status on the grounds that he has good reasons to fear persecution on political grounds in his home state.
0	Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!

0	It doesn't have to be that way because it's the death penalty. It's that way because of our ever deteriorating legal system.	First of all, death penalty cases usually cost more than keeping a prisoner alive for his life.http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/arti...did=108&scid=7
1	So if a jew tells a big nose joke, he's saying that all jews have big noses? This is a joke thread; I posted a joke, get over it.	I personally see no problem in anyone telling that joke, including a gay eskimo.
1	My point stands, just because you can't get it has no impact at all on its validity. YouTube - The jokes on you...	Which shows that he has not 'successfully made a point', as he claims.
1	wow a down-vote and no dispute, thanks kozlov (edit: or not kozlov?).	better in a clinic than in a back alley any damn day.
0	Yeah, see this is the old "gateway drug" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a "gateway" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something "harder"? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.	AND THEN, you get to the marijuana addict that decides to try crack because all drug addicts hang together and so someone will try to get you to try new stuff.
0	what? i assume one is within one rights to be anti-gun. that's all.	because you supposedly have no use for guns, you think you can assume that it's not a dark history.
0	there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic).	by saying he still had support i assumed you meant you thought it was somehow shifting to the democrats... my mistaken assumption.

1	Is that your logic? Does the phrase, "crime of opportunity" ring a bell?	Your probably right about locking your doors, but it don't take a pro to go around back and kick it in or bust a window.
0	You think "the unborn child is worthy of protection"..."but not more so than the mother, probably less"...yet you believe "in most circumstances the child should be carried to term?"	Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.
1	And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell.	and are only trying to earn themselves brownie points in heavan.
0	Bad, bad, bad. :( 1) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment.1) Some, perhaps all "Livestock feed" is actually edible for humans; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico.2) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten.	If you're prepared to eat livestock feed you've got a plan.
0	oh really? i prove evidence to the subject and i don't repeat the same thing over and over again. i am not repeating anything over and over am i. i think you are the worst debator.	he doesn't explain himself, and repeats the same thing over and over when we ask him to.
0	Religious faith, by definition, is a "jump in the dark" and there is really little(if any) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and ScientificMaterialism can meet. In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there isnothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science. Butsomeone who has, so to speak, already jumped into the dark cannot see this.The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law, morality, social conventions,aesthetic sensibility and such like.	You cannot begin to hold a rational debate about the unknowable.
0	That is true but that is the procedure.........Do you deny it?	Y'know, if a pro-choice person had posted a similar item from a pro-choice website, you would have dismissed it out of hand.
0	I think you might want to check your logic here... As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit. As you are, I am not terribly fond of policing someone's personal habits, but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries, assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored. This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem.	If drugs were more accessable we would likly have far less crime and far more drug adicts.
1	How can they visually express themselves without their right to expression, besides funky hairdoos.	There are many ways in which students can express themselves, clothing is just one.
1	I take it that you are not educated about maternal mortality in pregnancy, then?	Who am I to say what decision she should make.
0	i love how you broke that down, but why would anyone who feels content in their life, by into something that's telling them they are wrong? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one.	in order to sell religion they convince people that they need it by telling them they are going to hell if they don't buy into their religion.
1	i'm surprised he didn't google it. maybe that's too logical?	he couldn't be expected to know that, since the american method of teaching geography is war, and they haven't invaded them yet.
0	it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about. do you mean 'having faith' in actual things? if so, then most definately. although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place, it can also be a fantastic one, and seeing that (as i'm an athiest) gives me some kind of 'faith' in the human capacity, society, etc (where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god).	i find that atheists often (not always) lack the ability to trust, making it difficult to have faith, even if it is just to have faith in the human capacity to redeem itself once is a while.
1	So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?	Are you suggesting that abortion is a judgment of God?
0	Yes, but all concepts of right or wrong are subjective.	Second, do you believe there is such a thing as right and wrong?
1	Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view.	I never claimed anyone did live inside an embryo.
1	WW, are you talking to yourself?  If not, then please learn how to attribute statements to the person who made them.	that may be what you suppose exterrestrial life to be like, and as you are a materialist/mechanist, i'm not surprised to hear you say it.
0	The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section.	One trespasses when he's not in his rightful place, but a baby developing in the womb belongs there.
0	All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past. If you wish others to take this seriously please produce some relevant evidence from a source that held to a higher level of credibility. By your standards I should make a thread based on the National Enquirer or Star about Kerry's life as a male gigolo or golddigger.	the news sources we contacted today who told us to be very wary of you because you have yet to produce any evidence of this
1	i must admit i was a bit confused when you came out with this: where in this discussion did i offer any solution to zimmerman (i don't remember mentioning him at all)? nor did i give any suggestion as to what i would do. so where did this 'both of you' come from? please could you also point out where i interjected pepper spray into the debate? a quote would be nice. oh, and the term 'enemy combatants' was just made up so that the bush and his partners in crime could get round international law. the geneva convention does cover them very clearly in the quote i gave.	troops are not issued pepper spray so it is a non issue which both you and jerry chose to interject into the debate.
0	Because there is no evidence against the virgin birth and there is considerable evidence against Adam -- including the text of Genesis 1.	Why is it okay for him to accept the virgin birth of Christ, and riducule anyone who believes in the creation of the first man, Adam?
1	So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies.	So keep calling me Archie/Archangel, you just keep him alive, you who will be labeled MONGO MAXIMUS THE 1st from this time forth.
0	daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation.	it is often 'taught' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally: indeed, a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed, and this requires a more direct and deliberate move: thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs.
1	Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?  Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.	so if that satisfies everyone's dues then this is done with.
1	that's it brady? that's your answer? i don't know, maybe the american people are buying that! emoticonxsmilie like i said, that is what they are after!!!	we should be suing you, your .org, any other .org like vpc and voting and impeaching corrupt congressmen and groups like maig.
1	You should use the same quote when whining about use of partial quotes, and not introduce different ones. Nozza made a false assertion and was refuted with his own words. You introduce a different false assertion and fail. Epically.	You should use the entire quote rather than cut to attempt to prove what you aare about.
0	Ever been to eastern KY? Many of the residents share a very strong faith in the christian religion. They also share abject poverty, malnutrition and starvation, substandard or absent medical care, contaminated water supplies, and dangerous and often poorly heated / ventilated "housing". Yes Easy, truly their cups overfloweth.	If they turn to God he will make their way and grant their heart's desires.
1	What part did your real daddy play in it? Will he be on the island, too?  This is a good example of a scant level of maturity. Your simple out for various arguments is to play the idiot/XXXXX card.  More and more each day I see you as a complete waste of oxygen.	what we should probably do to set things right is put them all on an island, and let the terrorists go to town on it.
0	Actually your posts are providing increasing evidence for just how simple folks can get.	!Does it get any simpler?emoticonXKill
0	So the initial murder wasn't enough to show "that they are willing to commit acts of violence"? This makes absolutely no sense.	This has shown that they are willing to commit acts of violence and frankly have nothing to
0	Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?	I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.
0	Because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people.	And I repeat my earlier observation: if DOMA is such a travesty, why not go ahead and try to repeal it as a Senator.
1	John/John would figure out a way for the American taxpayers to foot the bill.	I don't know, getting mobbed by a pack of lawyers (and then getting the bill)  just might be worse than a quick death.
1	And the ability to digest nylon is not a new function?? You seem to have a different conception of 'new function' that what matches with reality.	And regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria, are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon?
1	well if I don't get an answer here I'll just spread it around the whole internet. Fine with me.	Well, answering you seems to be a waste of time.You ignore/reject any attempts at explaining the things you clearly do not understand, and youlater bring up the exact same things that you have had explained to you as if the subject was never broached before.You are incorrigible and uneducable.
1	i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?	if you really believe that gays are oppressed then believe me you ain't seen nothing in the world as yet.
1	Nonsense. Just look at all the great things that the Dark Ages did for Europe!	This isn't to say that ethics should be disregarded in science, far from it, but if the US raises a generation of kids who think science is satanic then the possibilities for development are going to be slim.
0	i'm surprised i agree with you on this. the only point i'd add is that the force feeding should only be used while the person is undergoing therapy to fix the underlying problems.	they have a fear of gaining wait - by force-feeding them, they shall learn that it will not kill them to be healthy.
1	Hey that cheeseburger is on me,and make sure it has extra  rat poison!	(Maybe he'll choke on it this time.
0	Why should every pro-lifer have to be an adoptive parent in order to have credibility?This is akin to saying that every pro-choicer should have to have an abortion -- or at least face that choice personally -- in order to be a credible pro-choicer.	If every pro-lifer was an adoptive parent I think they would have more credibility.
1	No but it will be funny to see what sex tapes this tramp did too....	Will the gay pride movement again try to make a bug issue of out of a beauty pageant's view of gay rights?
0	oh yeah. that is the one up-side of it. bleh! :p	which is the way i like it.
1	Interesting. It seems that you like to get your news from Aljazeera.	Half the 120 mosques in Fallujah were destroyed by US air strikes and tank main battery fire.
1	You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:  Question: Was Stalin a communist ?  Answer: That's what he said he was.  Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.	so stalin didn't actually practice communism (not that anyone has), but really just used bits and pieces to further his rule and such ideology is not communism but stalinism.
0	Yet another application of a different meaning of the word in an effort to group everything in science that you don't understand and won't accept under one word.	You could even have (4):4.
0	You should have said that. I might have agreed with you.	My point was that is it a horrible experience for many women, and that I wish we could strive towards a society where abortions were no longer needed.
1	Stick with the bass guitar. emoticonXRolleyes   And if you break a string....TRY not to blame it on Clinton. :p	As I have stated on one of the other threads, Bill Clinton,et.
0	What exactly has bin Laden gained? The last I heard, some 75-80% of his top leadership is dead or in the slammer. With "friends" like Bush, who needs enemies? How would you like to be on the run or living in a hole for the rest of your natural days? That's the life that bin Laden lives today. He has to communicate to the outside world via courier and donkey. And tell me again, how bin Laden gains by killing Muslims? I don't quite get that part.	After all, the search has all but stopped for him and the US is being bled dry in a number of areas under Bush's leadership.
0	If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional, then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind.	Do you not understand what is currently going on?The ruling on whether the California state constitutional amendment was enacted "legally" was ruled on by the courts.What is discussed above is entirely separate.To say something brief to get you up to speed, our state constitution CANNOT violate the federal constitution.So if Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment, then Prop 8 loses.Whether or not Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment is the question that is currently being examined.
1	After all he isn't a cousin after all is he. You obviously are older than I thought or spent too much time around the DPC. Old joke? Q. 'where do cousins come from,' A. 'aunt holes'.

1	Interesting.... have you ever been to a schoolyard recently? I think the "taunts" are more directed at gays. Like "f@ggot" and "fairy". What taunts do you get on a daily basis? What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo.	I think the real problem is that you just enjoy being belligerent and doing things like calling people "weasel" and "dishonest" when you yourself misrepresent like you did above.
1	I knew the mangling of Jesus's teachings would be forthcoming, and entertaining. emoticonXHoho   And of course lying about what I've said is just par for the course. Standard stuff, nothing to compare with trying to make Jesus out to be pro-cruelty.	And if someone were concerned about what constituted torture, I doubt he'd pretend it wasn't a valid question, as you're doing.How do you know exactly what Jesus would approve and condemn???
0	But you are forgetting life-without-parole (and I do mean WITHOUT parole). With life without parole, there is also no recidivism.	I suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti DP stance.
0	They're going to say no? CA tried that. Tell me the last time utility costs were reduced by a state agency. It's a rubber stamp and nothing else. We travel in different investment circles. I don't know anyone putting their money in US long-term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40-year useful life situation. What's your take on the US economy in 5, 10 and 20+ years? Good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached? Enviros or not, if the return is there money always has its own way of doing things. Corporations are awash in cash. Liquidity has been the name of the game for some time, but there are always bridge buyers.	For example, we haven't built a new refinery in almost 30 years although people are using more gasoline than ever; a group in Arizona has been trying since 1999 to get the necessary permits for another refinery, but they haven't yet been successful.
1	ooh lucy herself. so tell me, just out of curiosity, how do they know how much hair to put on her life size image? i notice she isn't that furry at all. how'd they figure that out from just a few bones? let's see, what do they call people like you at the carnival booths? oh that's right, an easy mark. have you read any other good fairy tales lately pandion, besides lucy that is.	they don't allow cameras but there are some on line at the lucy exhibit site.
0	Not many women would say they had an abortion now, let alone back when it was illegal.It is an emotionally trying event. I can understand why she wouldn't for that reason alone. Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence, or it could be a combination of the two.	It's kind of funny that they claim this happened, but can't get the woman to come out and say it?
1	Oh relax for cripes sakes. This is the "fun debates" forum if you didn't notice.	Those ads likely pay a large portion of the bill to be here...I pay nothing...I doubt you do either...I ignore the ads...I doubt you cannot train yourself to do the same.
0	Of course everyone has some basis for their views. Not even denying that. However there are ways that using that "basis" most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example. There are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. All I am asking here is that Archie, you, JP, etc. own that.	'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.
0	But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.	I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.
0	you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't.	all the laws in the world won't work, criminals will always be able to get guns.
0	Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.	"That may be true, but it isn't harmful so I doubt it really should be on the list."
0	And last years stats say, 3rd July 2009   The most violent country in Europe: Britain is also worse than South Africa and U.S.	Bus driver Terrance Gavan manufactured highly dangerous firearms and explosives at the home where he lived with his mother in Batley, West Yorkshire.Police discovered 54 improvised bombs including nail bombs and a booby-trapped cigarette packet, as well as 12 firearms.

Here is one of the links to those studies. emoticonXSmilie http://www.4forums.com/political/gun...tml#post354115But what do we do about this? http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcon...dennis_culhane Which is a study of criminals shooting criminals but it is hoped that people will think it is about Law Abiding Concealed Carry. This is NOT representative of Law-abiding Concealed Carry or legal gun ownership in any way. And we have this.Guns and Death - Firearms Research - Harvard Injury Control Research Center - Harvard School of Public HealthSo lets look at the actual crime figures to see if any of this holds water.  According to this 1999 article  there were 250 million guns in circulation in 1999.   Total NICS Background Checks November 30, 1998 - June 30, 2009	If you keep posting this nonsense then Tither's gonna come around, point out the exhaustive studies that show there's no link between gun control and reduced levels of violence,
0	Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing.

0	Actually, creation explains nothing. Evolution is an observation that is explained by theories that explain why populations of animals change. One explanation is the theory of natural selection.	All of the observations that we see today can be explained without creation and evolution!
1	Spain, unlike most modern democracies, very very recently had the uh.. privilege of living under a strong, "moral" government that supported the uh.. "family values" so important to the right.

1	i love how your sources never support your point. well, i wasn't able to find out about the rebellions of christianity from your source, but it did show some positive points, so i guess that was good.	you can read more here
0	Yes because it is "officially" a life.Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life.If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option.	We can't force a woman to give birth if she doesn't want the child, but we can force the father to pay for the child's care regardless of whether he wanted the child or not?

0	For a 13 year old girl that could greatly damage her body to have a pregnancy so young. She is just starting to grow and mature, and its not healthy, natural, or right to have a pregnancy at that age. She could cause alot of damage being that young.	You make some great points but she could carry the baby to term and then put it up for adoption...........There are long lists of people wanting to adopt babies...........I know a couple that waited 5 years and then adopted a child from South Korea..........Why does the innocent baby have to forfeit its life?
1	other than showing your ability to bold your false or irrelevant claims what was accomplished here? as for the date that the nt books were written, more importance could be given to those guesses if any still existed or if early christians could have refrained from changing the word of god. sorry current christians do it also so unfair to blame just the early ones.	scholars give their expert opinions: dating the nt too bad you're so steeped in denial over christ that you can't see the forest for the trees.

The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.	And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A.
0	I'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch, and my uterus is perfectly healthy, thankyouverymuch (not that it is any of your emoticonXCensored business), and yes, I do plan to have a child in the future, and don't really care what you think about it.	I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery.
1	And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.	Through the media's support of the presuppositions taught in high schools and under graduate institutions people all to often espouse their expertise in their knowledge of the certainty of evolutionary “theory” which is most always overwhelmingly lacking and incorrect.

1	what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers, shotguns, and ieds? what's your p***ing away excuse for instances like these? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer. it's like a wolf in the chicken coop.	school shootings are linked to semi-automatic and automatic weapons as demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt by the tasmanian authorities where following the ban on such weapons school shootings fell to zero.
0	And that part of the decision (not allowing for the woman's health to be taken into account) is why I do not agree with nor do applaud this decision (in fact I am rather disgusted with it). If you'd like to see a more concise view from me, you can see the thread that Another_opinion started here: http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/9678-mothers-health-exception-where-do-we-draw-line.html	But as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and SCOTUS chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure.

0	third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking.	of what concern of yours is it that dono or anybody else for that matter was circumsized, circumsized their kids or believes in circumsism?
1	While I fully realize you can't do math and thus why you consider it atheism, but post #96 and post #81 are not the same post. But then again, you were the one who argued that post 113 came before 106 so maybe you do think that complete failure to understand math and linear thinking is sane?	He rants and rages against us while never making even the most basic degree of rational sense, yet to him it's us who is wrong.
0	Well, "reasonable" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?	And 'basically'.. banning firearms (as often proposed by many democRATS) is 'reasonable'?
0	when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore. 'fu** the poor' - mike moore. i put that together after a class in the mike moore school of movie editining 101.	did he change anybody's word to make it as if they said what they really didnt say?

0	i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site.	have to be careful not to over-complicate the page, but for once its sometimes difficult to tell whether a reply is in favor or opposition.
1	Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the "normal course of nature", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die.

1	So the BBC folks are frauds and liars? You really are an idiot aren't you? Piltdown Bird is a colorful way of saying it was a Piltdown like fraud.   National Geographic knew it was a fake and published the article anyway.  Of course you probably still believe in the original Piltdown don't you?  You probably believe the Nebraska Man and Haeckels speechless apes were real too.  There is an echo when you think isn't there?	are you so stupid that you do not understand what the quotes around 'piltdown' signify?

0	I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it.

0	This is my understanding as well. Interestingly, concepts only approximate that which they intend to define. Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding.	We take reality and describe it in our minds and thus form it into abstract concepts which we can operate with.
1	tennis? you're joking right? it's already been proven that women can take on a man anytime in that game! others not so much but tennis most definately!	i say yes so that feminists and other women who think they're equal to men can see that they're actually not.
1	Oh but he is different in the mule's tiny mind. The Southern Baptist types are Christian and so uphold the mule's way of life, so it's alright for them to call for mass death.	He's no different from the Southern Baptist types who suggest nuking the middle east.
1	No, the law didn't specifically mention gays, or dwarfs, or one-eyed pirates, or 6 toed individuals. emoticonXRolleyes	The quote you mentioned in no way justifies allowing people to refuse to treat homosexuals while forcing them to treat all of those other protected groups.
0	Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding "cold")	But you will never come to agreement with everyone else in the world as to what makes something truly evil or good.

1	You forget, that all those nice rewards? None of them are rights.	Using your logic you may indicate that we should eliminate cars, food, heating/cooling systems, chairs, stairs, houses, apartments, work, money, paper, plastic, and basically everything that we have on earth because somewhere people are going to die because of almost everything.
1	First off, kudos on getting the quotes right! It's much appreciated.  Now, what's your actual assertion? If you spell it out than we can put this definition debate in context, and maybe actually get somewhere.	if all matter was information what would we need books or language for?

Well now my gay and liberal friends have resorted to Pope bashing........so very sad..........
1	How about other religious theories. What about teaching about the sun god? I don't mean that they believed that, but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe. Actually let's also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the Earth and other massive objects. We should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe.	Do you support the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public schools?Yes because it is the flipside to science and everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe.
0	a drink. a drink. one or two. and what the hell does abstinence have to do with this? everything in moderation, yeah yeah. all that fun stuff. i get it. i wasn't talking about light drinking. i guess i should clarify but i thought you'd catch what i meant.	you realize that weed being illegal is more harmful than good... and i dare you to get into a debate about that because i have so many facts in favor of ending prohibition it will make your head spin
1	and your kids go to private school yes? so you want higher teen pregnancy, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases?  if you are disagreeing with my statement that you want all of those lower, then you are admitting you either want them to increase or stay the same. as you have railed against abortion, it would appear you're being contradictory. make up your mind. and yet they have lower rates. funny how that works.  no. in the seven years since introduction 620,000 or so european women have used it. so that's around 88,000 abortions a year. 1.2 million happen in the us annually. as the population of europe is around the same as the us, it's not a valid point. 88k to 1.2 million is nothing.  plan b isn't abortion. try me.	do you have any children?
0	your argument is contradicting how can seeing people naked ifnringe on your personal thought and the other not? also the right isn't to marry whomever neterosexuals want. the limits apply to everyoen equally just people have different preferences.	if you could effectively prove that two homosexuals marrying each other would harm me physically or mentally, (and thus taking away my rights as a citizen), i would say you have a point.
0	That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb.	And in response to Zachvac i mean guns not arms (as in nukes) but im fine with automatics and such in the right hands.
1	So what do ya Say! Come On. Be reasonable! Do it for the children! Or don't we care about these children because they weren't hurt or killed by a firearm?	Downward trends, also being reported by other sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.CDC reports a significant decline in accidental firearms-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1994 and 2005.
1	Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.	It seems King Blue is the stereotype that pro-choice folks think of when they see a pro-life person.
0	Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?	Plus what did all of the insectivores eat for 40 days?
0	Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman.	Don't they get that the whole pro-choice movement is based in a desire to make sure that ever child is a wanted child?
1	Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it	A women by the name of Mary Anne Warren said this
1	i love when random myth followers talk about critical thinking :d	i see critical thinking isn't something you're particularly familiar with.
0	You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.	it dosnt simply say "see bible"everybody should have equal rights.
1	Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.	While things like this seem like small pro-life victories, they are really considerable and should encourage us pro-lifers that we are making a difference--getting back to a higher value of the unborn is our goal, and we must not let up.
1	Yes, but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper. Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that!	emoticonXFrazzled So .... you actually think the collapse of the Minnesota bridge is because of gay marriage???
1	So it's just fine if someone says "gay people are prone to force Christians out of their towns", eh? Interesting. emoticonXWowJust "typical English usage", after all ....	Some statements are obviously meant to demonstrate a common thread regarding a group action, but not to claim the ENTIRE group commits that action.
0	That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue.	Again, these are facts that the pro-life/Christian-Con movement you never find out about.
0	i love how hamas apologists require showing idf abuses to defend their actions. pathetic.	why don't you tell us about the terrorist activity that necessitated military activity that inevitably caused also civilian deaths.
0	You know that what you call "immoralism" is my life. Why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due? You don't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you. I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry.	Personally, I think U.S. conservatives have gotten too complacent these days--we need to protest like this more often.
1	Ah yes, adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others, to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy.	A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.
1	Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea! A lot of their mythology isn't original: it was stolen from other people who thought it up first.	Listen not to the lies of the Foodstuff demons, instead bow down to the Invisible Flying Space Monkeys, for they are the only path into heaven!
1	Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes   I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away.	If I haven't made you understand already, imagine a well-known media personality saying what I've just said to you, right out loud, to all the world, but off-the cuff and for no reason.
0	Well, that's your claim, anyway. Truth is that billions of theists accept evolutionary theory as is and reject the standard ID arguments.	All too often those opposed to Intelligent Design simply reject any notion of God no matter how unemotional and rationality based that notion is.
0	oh really?  science does not say 'we dont know x, y, z, but we want to know x, y, z, and so we observe x, y, z, and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true, or not? (it's a question..) if scientists were too busy learning what is, then the science that is present now, would be non existent, because in order for science to learn and understand, it must be too busy learning and understanding what 'might be', or what it has not known, yet.	scientists are too busy with learning more about what is, than what might be.
0	a lot of people are adopted... my science teacher was adopted. he had a successful military career that ended with him as a war planner helping to plan the gulf war... he had a successful chiropratic practice too. what you said is not so true. should he have been denied his life because of some emotional trama he might bave later in life? i don't think so.	some more innocent people will not be killed.
1	poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.	maybe you can look it up on the net.
0	hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill	i can name my own; germanic, and celt, slavic, and dinaric(italian-greek) are others as well.
0	Actually there is a better solution.   Mandatory male and female birth control pills, financial penalties if you stop taking. Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.	...to curtail abortions.Any woman who has an abortion for convenience only (not raped, no incest, no danger to the mother's life) shall have both ovaries removed.What do y'all think?
0	It is in the first place unclear to whom the "further harm" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different.	The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child.
0	oh yes i forgot to answer the key question: where does information come from. its a simple answer. from a local decrease in the degree of disorder. ie a reversal of local entropy. see adami for a development in mathematical and biological terms.	i don't care what the definition is...i can't even get you kooks to answer if information exists or not, even by your own defintion.
0	here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway.	like stem cell research, same-sex marriage and speaking in tongues?
0	The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary.	The dino would be to heavy to glide or fly with them if they weren't fully developed, and even then only a few yards could be gained when jumping off a hill, ect, and when not fully ready.

1	every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make.	well those 'slave owning white guys' (of which not all of them had slaves and most of them knew slavery needed to be ended) founded your country and established the government by which you feel protects your 'right to abortion' or 'personal autonomy'...eventhough they never established this....

1	wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights? well no duh but if i 'bucko' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i'm slightly different i'm not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality. and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay, accepted it and realized that other people aren't the end all and be all, that they'd eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn't the world maybe they'd still be alive.	if you can't answer, maybe you should deal with that.
1	In other words you would wait until we were attacked again before doing what is required. If we vacillate and wait for the nuclear cloud it will be too late. It amazes me; utterly amazes me, at how strongly felt the left believes in the good will of bin Laden and the terrorists to clean up their act. Just amazing. But with Bush? Noooooooo. He's ALWAYS wrong and never right. Isn't that about it?	I'd rather be correct and doing the right thing to make the world safer.

All he should be charged with, and I expect he will before this is tried in court is breaking the Airport procedures, or maybe they are FAA procedures which could imply Federal laws.   This guy should have contacted the Airport at check in to report each and every weapon he was traveling with. They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed. I must say that I'm somewhat alarmed at some of what is allowed if I put my terrorist thinking cap on.

0	why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people.	sure, they've probably a hell of a lot of stories and anecdotes which would prove entertaining, but they're ... they're filmmakers, of all things!

0	emoticonXWowYou are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along.Asking "what they would need" is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place.A lot of "doesn't this look like ...", but that's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests. You see what you want to.	I think most scientists would admit the universe looks designed, so what would convince them that it actually is?
0	It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.	And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.
1	I can hear all the scores of laughter now. emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes   But alas, this is pointless, as are you. I'm bored and done.   ciao	Words like "high road" coming from your mouth is incredibly funny.Keep at it !!
1	According to Genesis? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence? How about Darwin's On the Origin of the Species?	Anyone who looks at this situation logically should realize that at sometime in the past there must have been a time when there was less genetic damage in the genome.
0	I did not say that violent crime "rarely" occurs, merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks. I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals.	Because being the victim of a violent crime happens enough times for it to be a genuine concern.

0	i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management.	you are indeed correct that uncontralable forest fires are hazardous for humans who live nearby (as well as property).
0	Said like a cruel evil person who has no concern for his fellow man.	Just because you think you are entitled to what I earn doesn't make it so.
0	"True" is not a good use of language to describe opinion. With regard to his opinion, I think he makes some good points, so I don't really need to ask him if its true. You on the other hand do need to speak to Olsen as you are claiming his letter rubbishes the concept of evolution- an opinion I hazard he would very much disagree with.	Why don't you write Dr. Olsen and ask him if this is true?

1	I think we're seeing a culture war. Hardly seems a fair fight though, since only one side has any.:p	But what do I know.
1	lol...you read my whole post only to conclude with "what's your point." Evolutionist brilliance on display. I'm not mistaking nothing for nothing. I know my stuff. You obviously know nothing and don't care to learn it.	I'm not sure what your point is.
0	Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore.	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of.
1	Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....	So we're not in the mood to discuss future restrictions that won't be used either.

0	allright, well then i think it's odd too, arians would have made more sense. i'm surprised they are considered obscure, the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church, and the arian controvery was it's main event. for the record, they were discussed in my high school, that's why i was making sure.	there would be absolutely no reason at all to discuss a relatively unknown and ancient religious cult in a junior high level history book.
1	You're out of your depth here kid. Go and clean your push-bike before you go out on your paper round....it's a disgrace!	But then he's been taking it in the shorts every time he posts his nonsense.
1	HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is.   6) And the standard "theistic evolution" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it.	Evolution and the rest of "big science" are just described as having an atheistic preference.
0	Having human DNA does not necessarily make one a human being. Transgenic animals can have human DNA, does that make them human beings.	By the term human I simply mean it is a member of the human species.

0	Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case.	If there's not, we investigate certainly and prosecute if the law allows.
0	i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea. (from the science point of view)all humans are traced to monkeys from africa. from there they spread throughout the world. if it is not evolution, then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs? how come africans have a darker skin tone? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair? i doubt it is coinsidental, and no offense, but i dont think that a god did this for us. every person has a subconscience. in this subconscience we think of lesser facts. does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better? i believe so.	i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of.
0	do they conver the same types of subject? i have, as yet, not heard much 'good' about american education (nor health), so it's interesting to hear about these things from the horse's mouth (so to speak).	most midwest colleges take act scores and most eastern schools want sat scores, so most kids i know take both.
1	It's not often you see such a golden opportunity handed to you on a silver platter.	You don't see me getting on here and saying "and you call yourself an atheist?"
1	ah yes....."Gaytheist," the terminal homosexual atheist liar at various forums such as IIDB and Tweb misrepresents me to some guy who studies tadpoles. The little XXXX liar atheist claimed to the author that I used his paper as "evidence" of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she couldn't back up when I pressed her on it. This was merely his response to her strawman lie. Funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is.	Have I missed something in your list of delusions?A little something from your time at TWEB
0	It's possible that Archaeopteryx is not a direct descendant of modern birds but it's certainly not far from the line and it shares both avian and therepodian characteristics.	Where are the fosils showing it evolving from a bird or reptile?
1	i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused.	if you have one, i would love to hear it.
0	I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. Until then I'll remain skeptical. Let's remember that Democrats and liberals hunt. Remove that group and what's left? Something less than 20% of Americans that own only handguns.	No I'm not suprised I wish I could put my hands on the pol on firearms ownership that put the % of dems that owned guns was around 46%.
1	And because this man said it, it must be true? A simple appeal to authority.	Robert Naeye, a writer for Astronomy magazine and an evolutionist, wrote that life on earth is the result of “a long sequence of improbable events [that] transpired in just the right way to bring forth our existence, as if we had won a million-dollar lottery a million times in a row.”
0	I think bringing "emotions" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to "non-belief" would be irrelevant (and irrational).	when such is the case, it is no different from a religion
1	We have a terrorist supporter among us, objecting to restrictions on terrorists! Why do you hate America?	Terrorist agents, who have access to missile launchers, grenades, grenade launchers, heavy machine guns, and anti-aircraft cannons, all of which come from all other nations in the world...are going through the hassle of coming to America, procuring forged documentation, and buying civilian legal firearms that no army in the world has ever adopted as their main battle weapons?Did you eat lead paint as a kid?

0	i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it.	this creed strains credulity to the utmost, and i suspect you'll find lots of christians who don't accept it literally.
1	Well are there 4 or are there none? What about the Archaeopteryx lineage, why do you keep avoiding the question by changing the subject? It's no wonder scientists get annoyed with creationists.	All you can show me are 4 "links".
1	So theistic evolution is not a belief, not a faith at all? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using God to fill gaps?	Conclusion from data and reason, not belief.
1	Worship me and I'll bless you too. With money of course. He can't even give you money. I am the true god and I created the mindset that he was a god in him. Worship me and spread the word about the true religion. Everyone who joins my church will instantly get $1,000 and after a week of membership you will get $1 million. The end of the week is when my project is and then you can go into the real world. All those who didn't believe in me will be destroyed when my world I created gets to the dump.	Worship not money, and I will bless you.

1	You have no Idea how glad I was that I was sitting down when I read this!!  First it shocks me that you haven't labeled all those who claim to see UFO's liberals.  Then I have to wonder didn't at one time the RCC say we were the center of the universe,... The sun went around the earth,... the earth was flat ?? Theres no one but us .. It was all created for us??  Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something. I think I'm going to be sick!! Back in a few.	mm i am usually with you on every issue but we part company on this one......there have just been to many credible people who have had sightings.......maybe they are light years ahead of us in the technology of space travel...............can you imagine what they could teach us if they made contact?
0	and you believe that to be what? you really need to just say who/what you think the creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.	for the sake of discussion let's say it is the same one all the signers of the declaration of independence agreed it was.
1	They're not Jews, and not rabbis, just like you, who are not in your right mind, and who is an authority on nothing but rubbish.	Apparently you've never heard of Messianic rabbis who don't buy into basic Judaism.
1	So much bandwidth; so little substance.   Aren't you embarrassed to post such inconsistent ramblings?   Women with pre-existing mental problems are more likely to experience post-abortion issues. Well, DUH!!!	if i didn't know you, i'd swear this was an (almost as idiotic) pro-lifer post concerning the incapability of women to make their own decisions.
0	And you've been failing miserably, partly because your definition of "atheism" is asinine. Even most Christians would disagree with you.	I enjoy written debates very much, and I'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the U.S. government ...
0	And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay.	Even though I love them because they are my family, I would not support them if they were to marry.
1	Hmmm, was that an ad hominem attack? You know, what you accuse others of doing? Hypocrite.	Now how could I have forgotten about your lame XXX.
1	I thought the almighty expressed his will in the Bible for mortal men to know it...	Let's see if we have this correct.You are a mortal man and yet you dare speak as though you know the will of the Almighty.What was that again abut the sins of pride and arrogance?
1	I know I know. Unless a woman is gestating or dieing she is being selfish.	And, Jitobear, this is exactly what I was saying when I spouted the abortion statistics in the US.
1	Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not? Well, alledgedly, 23 innocent people have been put to death, and for sure two unrefutable cases. I don't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system.	what I am talking about is not a death penalty trial as we have today, but after the person has received a 100 year or more sentence.
1	the moon is made of cheese because i said so. was i persuasive? neither were you. do you have the capability to actually debate with facts? you saying something is true doesn't make it so. oh, and i'll save you the trouble.. i'm going to burn in hell, i'm, how does it go? spiritually challenged? and oh yeah, i'm going to bring about something called rapture or something like that. lol	you're right in step with satan, though, so you can really feel proud of that.
1	Thank You. You know how much I love to impress people.	We're all quite impressed with your knowledge of third grade insults, unfortunately, this is not debate.
0	Life evolved over billions of years rather than being created in a few days.	Tell me ONE scientific fact that contradicts the Bible ?
0	Prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative Christian rather than a conservative Republican OP. Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together.	My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations.
1	EZ. That is not what I said.I would think a Bible website would be good for biblical information, but for archaeological information? not so much.If you want to provide archaeological evidence of the Exodus, why don't you seek out information from an archaeology sources? Please answer this.If I wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings, I wouldn't seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource, I would seek an archaeology expert. Doesn't that make sense?	Shame on you for that bigotry.
1	How uninteresting must that be for you to intentionally spend time annoying people on the internet?	Oh, I have a life...I'm working on my second music cd and a spoken word effort....in my personal studio.
0	in what passages does jesus refer to his junior partner? i'm not saying he did not, rather, i'm not recalling off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus.	the holy spirit is referred to repeatedly by jesus in the gospels, and the working of the spirit is a central theme in acts and paul's letters.
1	that i later 'concede' in a pm? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession.... what do you think a 'logical premise' is? show me denying that i said a. i'll be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. of course there is an objective truth here, i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable....	or maybe you just needed to redesign logic to go along with the redesigned universe you came up with when you first arrived?
0	simone darling, please stop. your making yourself look foolish. your trying to compare uniformed soldiers in an organized military under civilian gov't control to terrorists. there is no comparison to be made here, even you should be able to see that. huh? the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia.	the way he conducted himself, bush probably wanted to get totally out of afghanistan too.
0	how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!	i believe dametel is referring to leviticus 20:13 - 'if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.
1	i am impressed you are impressed by that backward-minded bigot who's main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said, 'fuck the fags'? come on dude.	yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.
0	yeah, that was all just exaggeration and absurdities from religionist to make the story more fantastic and supernatural. or else nobody will ever join them religion.	i just don't believe that a certain jesus came to this planet, born by a virgin, walked on water, died on a cross so people can enter heaven.
0	It is an acronym for 'Y'oung 'E'arth 'C'reationist. In other words... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God.	Am i stupid or something... whats a YEC?
0	And she was having unprotected sex? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility? Yeah, I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers.	Supposing she drank heavily before she knew she was pregnant.
0	The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow. Please give me one way those two things relate to each other.	THEY care about life more than the "free" world....I believe that one of the reasons we are dealing with terrorism in the world is because we are committing mass murder on babies in the womb...Need i say more...
1	'poor bill' ? yes poor poor bill, i really feel sorry for him for having the misfortune to meet monica . anybody who had the bad luck to meet monica deserves our compassion and pity. yes.... poor poor bill....so hillary was a saint and lord knows what monica was !	thats precisely the problem: saints are good for one thing only, hence monica.
1	Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?	Mayabe they were wise, but they didnt have all the knowledge on the topic of power or they would still be in controll today.
1	in that case its a single act of terroism so if you know all of this what's the name of his group? i wasn't on a high horse. also could you post the source saying he was part of some group and not just a loon.  jeez that sucks. *shrugs* well no different from black leaders who were targeted, slave owners/abolitionists who were targeted. this happens all the time. i'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. i love how its a conspiracy! *roll eyes* its terrorism not a conspiracy. unless you gonna tell me the governments in on it. xd	he did, and we do know why he did it.
1	What the heck did you have for breakfast today, huh? A bowl of nails and terpentine to wash it down? Talk about a foul mood. You've been to half a dozen threads just this morning launching personal attacks at everybody you come across, and most of them have something to do with 'I'm glad there aren't more people in the world like you,' or 'I hope you're the only ones the terrorists kill so we can get back to making this nation great,' blah blah blah. They invented things like Midol for moods like yours.Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them stupid, or misguided, or immoral, or dishonest, or any of the other snipes you've been firing off. Lol, and you're telling me to not throw any hissy fits.	Thank god there are not more people like you in the world/.
0	What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. MayThere is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations. I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3 One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:	These authors claim that for an entity to be regarded as a person, it must have developed at least incipiently exercisable cognitive capacities or abilities..... (Another view} distinguishes between a living human body and a living human person.
0	For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad. If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together.	But, what if, everything in the universe was originally "placed" pretty much where we see it now?
1	i lived next door to a dope dealer who was a murderer, am i dead ? no !	i find it offensive, not out of being a pedophile, but by being american, taught to respect other peoples rights.......and here we are 40 years after martin luther king.........still violating peoples rights successfully.
0	Dealt with. Wolves and dogs share a genus, not a species. Along with coyotes and jackels. See above for lots of transitionals, also.	I'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species.
0	now lets add one more wrench into the anti-gun works! when the american people read, 90% of weapons come from the u.s. they are led to think, bought in an american gun store.  something even sinjin apparently believes as well. however, doing some research, i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u.s. weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store. why? because they came from the u.s. government, dea and the cia. military grade weapons. now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u.s. weapons?    central america: the farc, the contras and the flow of weapons  america! get the picture now?	although it must be noted that some percentage of the weapons that were not traceable could well have come from north of the border as well.
1	You evidentally didn't grasp the apparently immense complexity and vagueness of my post.	Are you for or against a ban on smoking in public places?
0	i'm pretty sure you're joking... but still, if one has the power to acquire and manipulate knowledge sufficiently well, then one can learn to protect himself from bombs and such. my house was recently afflicted by ants. massive amounts of ants. yet their numbers did not amount to much after the strategic placement of a few of these.	the first time he eats a pizza with something good on it, has a beer or a little bit of grab-ass with a woman not wearing a beekeeper suit, muslims will commit to blowing up and/or beheading him, and by sheer number alone, they will succeed.
1	so atop a mountain of ignorance is where we will find religious people? yeah, sounds about right to me.	he has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.'
0	Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.	Heading further down that path...If the "right" belongs to the child, then the "right" obviously also DOES NOT belong to those opposed to gays.More specifically, the "right" to WAIVE potential parents as ineligible does not belong to those who are opposed to gays.The "right" would belong to the child to decide who HE/SHE wants, and it would be a bigger usurpment of this right of the child to DENY the child the option of gay parents than it is to present him with the option.
1	So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot.	Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.
0	Since they are issued by the military I would think so.	Are those weapons registered?
0	Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one.	if something happens to the people who are named on the website as a direct result of the website then i would say a great deal of justice is due and the burden of guilt is on the one who runs the website.
0	the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.	over the last generation or so, the dutch became quite good at rescuing hostages from the hijacked trains that became an annual event; the russians lost a number of hostages in a theater a few years ago when the gas they used proved a bit strong; and the filipinos became notorious for losing all hostages.
0	If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is "true"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator. References:* The Creationist Basis for Modern Science.* The Lie: Evolution ~ Ken Ham.* Evolution: Fact or Fiction? ~ John Blanchard.	You can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason.
0	if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep.	so really what was your point cause you haven't made one!!!
1	Ha. Those must be the same folks who believe in the missing link like you do.	I am surprised (well not really) that you don't see the simularity.And, we must not forget the Elvis believers too

1	would you like some cheese with that whine? emoticonxrolleyes btw this only shows over 60+ years of liberal government incompetence.	i think that it demonstrates that the liberal biased media got it dead wrong.
1	Umm, don't know about you but I also eject waste through my penis - just don't do it when having sex, just not polite (unless they ask, now there's another fetish I don't get). Isn't it odd if the anus was not designed for a penis its still pleasurable?	In fact it is dangerous to shove things up there, such as a penis, especially when the body is trying to send waste out; this courses all manner of problems associated with digestion.
0	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.	In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'?
0	But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.	In that case, even if you want to put religion into the mix.
0	The guy can have an opinion but the ultimate choice is up to the woman who can listen to what the guy says or not, it's up to her. I believe that is what sinjin was saying.	I have known girls who have gotten pregnant and wanted an abortion but the fathers of the babies told them they didn't want them to have an abortion so the didn't and now the baby is healthy.
1	not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage. 'ex-gays' are supposedly straight, right? so they are already protected under existing legislation. if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans, and then insisted they should be known as 'ex-democrats', would we need another legal status for them? no.	i don't keep track of who is who, but whoever is pushing for hate crime laws that establish gays as a protected group with special legal rights.
0	Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word "proof" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story.	So I should not accept what you say without some degree of doubt.
1	That explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? ROTFLMAO	Nice work; I think that the reason those kids who own guns are more likely to get into trouble is a result of a specific political outlook that they are raised under which has an ifluence on their thinking.
0	I believe it's there, but I'm certainly no one to push that belief on anyone.	And all I was saying is that, despite Zechariah, I have yet to find anything supernatural in myself.
1	Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march.	think of it this way...you have 1 camera at the event...you hear about this 't-shirt' thing and all of a sudden the camera is not focusing on the kid tripping over himself to roll the egg but to gay parents wearing these t-shirts and them talking about how they are great parents.
0	Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.	It is a direct accusation by the CURATOR OF BIRDS for the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION against all the proponents of the dino bird story.
1	Are you blind? I was refering to Nancy Pelosi's "'fair' speech" policies, not free speech. Fair speech is an attempt to limit free speech.	Utter nonsense!It sounds like a bunch of bozos still haven't figured out what free speech is all about.
0	race is the elephant in the room of american politics. segregation is not official, but who can deny that de facto segregation does not exist in the usa? blacks stick to blacks and whites to whites. do you see any blacks in the tea party meetings? how many blacks voted for jon mccain in the last presidential elections?	did you know that jefferson was an advocate of racial segregation?
0	Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of "creation science" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion.	If there are many people reading this that already believe in evolution, or for that matter, believe in biblical creationism, then it is important to keep in mind that the people appealing to science have biases at work, regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves.
1	Hey, it's the same god, just older. The birth of his son mellowed him out, you know,.. made him think about the future more, and have to worry about responsibility and all that stuff.	Why does it keep referring back to the OT without mentioning that the god that is around today is a different one?
0	Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of "creation science" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science.	Wow a statement that is both honest and correct from a creationist!
1	I am not making a mockery of the second ammendment (and so what if I am. Isn't free speech on the first ammendment?). I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this. If I was mocking anything it was that you were dodging the question because you want to say no limits although in face of something so obvious you are embarrassed at such a statement.	You know the answer.
1	Fundies don't say do as I say, not as I do. We say do as God says, not as I do. There's a huge difference.	These are the ones who preach "do as I say, not as I do."

1	You don't mean Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, do you? The Russian spies? Nah, you said wrongfully accused.....	Or someone who was wrongfully accused doesn't get a chance to get out.
1	The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust.	You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.
1	as i said, for clarification, and no other reason. it's all drivel to me anyway, so i didn't see the problem in adding evolution onto theory. show where it said that if you would, and clarify your question. if you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life. i'm surprised you couldn't deduce that by just reading what it said. why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article? can't you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it?	some other questions i would like answered about your 'proof' would be: why is it assumed that the nuclear reaction taking place in the sun's core would be perfectly linear?
0	Really? Let me see. Two creation myths and a global flood myth where 5 million "kinds" of animal were crammed into a big box that magically floats for a year - yeah, that's secular history.	The claims made in the Bible can all be see in secular history.
0	I do appreciate your point while I disagree on principle. I guess it boils down to the fact that even if I believed in a God I couldn't accept that He would command us to suppress our true innate nature. Why would He makes us that way and then expect such a thing? Christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what God commands. To suppress a good many natural inclinations. To accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished, our nature brought to heel.	Of course I agree with you about sexuality, but that is a different issue.

0	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i think that it can because money has fixed all of my problems.  come on! give me an answer to what can't money fix? leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. i would feel however i was feeling before i died. in the debates hypothetical i wouldn't even know that i was going to die. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that? wow! there are many things? to back up your assertion, list 5 of these things for me.	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant.
0	and the other two...? 'political disorder and confusion' is not the same as personal 'disorder and confusion'.	as has been pointed out to you now more than once, the most that can be ascertained from the evidence is that it was possibly done in some places--perhaps in remote areas or areas that were not entirely in lockstep with rome (or constantinople early on).
1	WOW are we seeing the softer, gentiler Jyoshu?   Your snoopy avatar must be afecting you :) :p	Gay people are right when they say that things like divorce are a lot more prevalent of a problem; I think churches need to cool it some on the homosexuality thing and simply work on showing the love of Christ.
0	I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.	If they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare, and not just legal.
0	What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.	#3 - Can anyone explain to me why no other apes, monkeys or chimps have evolved into a higher species?

0	one idea per episode? there were always at least 4; one for each main character. and they always linked together perfectly. with the exception of a few episodes at the beginning and the last one, seinfeld was always gold.  the simpsons, on the other hand, has sucked for the last few years when they turned to the 'pick a celebrity guestspot' system.	the show 'seinfeld' was absolutely hilarious.
0	you're assuming a need to reduce it because government, or a special interest, requests it. if enough people want it reduced, their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it. deemed by whom? the government, or a special interest? who cares about the species? the majority of individuals, or the government, or a special interest? if the majority doesn't consider them problems, then no solutions are necessary.	ok, no one said that i would look to a large govt for anything.
1	Leave it to a leftist to cite a leftist forum for evidence that a leftist agenda is supported by dedicated leftists. Go figure, huh? This post just proves that attempting to reason with such an irrational thinker is truly a waste of time and effort.	You and your other handles that comprise this entire forum of one man who probably also needs to see a doctor for a strong psychiatric prescription.
0	Clinton gave access to b/c which is known to prevent pregnancies. Bush has reduced access to b/c (including e/c). A primary reason for aborting is money - Americans have been less well off under Bush.	Of course, we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time.
0	Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.	Are you telling me that arctic foxes at some point in history did not have this ability?

0	And for the record, i think anyone that tries to take away a women's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life, or has any concious about the woman at stake here. You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. I am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do.	Any other subjects on which you are delusional?probably....I think anyone who kills an unborn child with a knife to the head is a murderer.
0	HA wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints, muscels, heart, and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb? Obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet. Some of which can be detrimental.I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out.And im not really sure what a "pregnancy" is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant, i think of 2 people, not just 1.Also, the baby has its own blood, its own immune system, and contains its own calories once consumed. theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion. Just like you need food everyday.	Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental.

0	Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it.	He's a creationist for crying out loud.Their manta is "to lie, steal, cheat, and defraud anyone" to get their message across.
0	Brinks plays on people's fears to sell security systems that don't even work. Insurance companies play on people's fears to sell their policies.	The glorification of firearms in movies and video games is wrong and promotes irresponsible gun usage, but the gun industry's advertising propaganda, which exploits people's fear of criminals to sell guns, is perfectly responsible.
0	He was barred for presenting hard evidence against the Big Bang. Observable evidence. He was the head astronomer at Mt Carmel not just another astronomer. He was our best one.Being barred from the telescopes he was in charge of , being fired , and having to move to Germany is not what you consider suppression? I am not willing to discuss this with you anymore if you refuse to do it honestly. You can say anything.	Halton Arp is far from suppressed.Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.
0	well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?	when someone says 'there is no convincing evidence for x', you have to look at what biases they may have about x which might cause them to set their requirements for 'convincing' to be higher - or lower!
1	And you know what I think? I think that everyone who doesn't have sex 24 hours a day 7 days a week is denying human beings life every second. I'm sure some of those sperm would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you don't think they should live [/sarcasm]. Why don't you think this? Why embryos? Embryos are the one thing that have great potential to cause harm in a woman, and you just so happen to choose them as human beings. Very suspicious...	i would say that those people are glad to be alive and im sure some of those aborted babies would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you dont think they should live..

0	Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing.	For the most animals, the indicator for life is brain activity (Note: brain activity is one of the requirements of life, but it's not THE definition).
1	woohoohoo, diogenes, talk about twisting my statements, wow! wow! i am just plain flabbergasted!	it seems to me, in light of the number of recent child rape/murder cases committed by recidivists, that simone has it backwards and those folks who have no faith in our justice system would rather see ten innocents die rather than punish one guilty person.

0	ya know what? this has inspired me to make a thread, hold on a sec.	i don't think personal attacks are the route to take, but i may be too nice :p i would emphasize that while the fetus does have importance as a potential member of our society, when the woman becomes pregnant we have to deal with what it is.

0	ummm... the death penalty has always been around. i never claimed that death was the penalty for every crime, nor that it was the most common punishment. try to catch up	There is written law going 2500+ years back and death penalty was not the most common punishment used.

0	True. Gallup couches the questions in a way that favors spiritualism. That is his preference and I think that his polls are slanted that way. I don't think I have ever seen a poll that actually asked the question directly and "no religion" doesn't really ask it. The numbers are just guesses. I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low.	The trouble with those poles is that peopel who 'have no religion' can be theists, and there are atheists that assocatite themselves to religions for social reasons.
1	You don't want anyone saying gay people are whacked, but you will make it your business to insult someones religion?! You are a hypocrite!! You say,"Don't judge gays!" But you are judging people by their religon?! I thought you were more mature then that. Hey you live ad learn.emoticonXRolleyes	Its like they knew that once these kids hit college they would a) get too horny, b) find reasons to question their faith.
0	darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class.	i have seen these debates and granted mine are not the best debates and may just be plain and simple retarded but my answers match the question.
0	Says who? People have the right to say anything they want to. There is NO right to not be judged by someone. It doesn't matter if something someone else does affects you and me or not. People can think whatever they want about other people. People can also SAY what they want. As far as a personal philosophy of behavior, I agree with you--what you're saying is a good rule to live by. But I can't agree people have no right to condemn or judge others.	In fact I have no right to suggest they even try if it doesn't impact me directly and negatively.
0	1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. i haven't watched tv in quite a few years, and when i did i didn't watch c span.  where are the facts that the court has cited? 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself. wouldn't i have to be in denial in the first place though?	2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself.
0	Oh it's no mistake Montalban. I, unlike you, am quite clear in my arguments, and have a direction and a goal. We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you "allow" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it!	You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about, and argue against that.If you want a (non-exhaustive list) seehttp://www.crystalinks.com/creation.htmlYou have simply picked one model, treated it as the only one, and constructed a (thus false) argument against it.
1	You know I actually considered that. Too much work, though. I have added to my list of things to do when I retire. That is, of course, assuming that we turned things around by then. If not, I will likely be too busy "holding the fort" against the hordes of starving yuppies.	Looks to me like its time to set things straight by writing your own book and name it " The Kansas Conspiracy Farce" by Daewoo :)
1	I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?	It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
1	Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be. These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone.	There is no possible way they could "accidentally" be so off the end result.
0	And are people in DC legally allowed to carry their guns with them in a concealed manner, having them readily available like the rest of us do in the country?Absolutely not. According to DC your rights don't extend past your home, and it barely even exists inside your home.	The Indiana Law Blog: Courts - New DC gun laws tested under Heller standard [Updated again]So gun nuts got their way in DC and now look what happens...
0	That just sounds alarmist to me. Do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights? It is just not going to happen.	I'm not saying being a lefty is bad, it's just that it seems some would throw away a right just to "feel" safe.
0	i'm going to presume that you are a christian. why are you a christian? because you happened to have been brought up in a christian family. why aren't you a hindu? because you weren't born in india. if you were born in india, you'd be a hindu. if you were born in central africa, you'd be believing in strange mountain gods.  use your brain, however reassuring and pleasant it is, god does not exist.  oh yeah, and why won't god heal amputees?	if you know a little bit, isn't it possible that in what you don't know, there is god?
1	dude, check my results. i'm shocked. i answered honestly. wow. you were def right, i aint no liberal. o.o	well... i guess no one can call you a rino.
1	Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.	Wow I think I may have won Hank's debate and the only proof you need is at dictionary.com
1	Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime? Or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander?	What price activist judges?
0	Logical truths do not come from "somewhere", your question makes as much sense as "What time is a moose?".You do not appear to have read my post at all, variously repeating what I have said and addressing things I did not say.	where do concepts come from when all that exist is matter, we know concepts are outside and are not dependent on matter or experence, or being discovered (if we did not discover them they would still exist)how can matter bring about something that is not matter
1	as to the first part, i answered you above. regarding the second part; what in the world are you talking about? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs? and boys born of virgin mothers? can you post any evidence of these cases? beside jesus of course, because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit.	and just to push your opinion a little further, if the soul enters the new being at fertilization, then does this mean that those girls (though very rare) who are born just from an unfertilized egg have no souls.
0	Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing.       Why didn't YOU cite them?	That is just a story of one person.
1	well there is an educated answer :) thanks for the feedback	There's no 'baby' to kill.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>..No
1	the liberal propoganda army is on the way? the man  must be lonesome!	i guess we are all still waiting in anticipation for the liberal calvary to arrive....
0	But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption.	If the "big bang" created matter than were did the stuff needed to make the "big bang" come from?
0	There is never a question of "killing people" in such circumstances, it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die, i.e. where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery.	Often, this debate becomes dotted with examples of things like human vegetables who might come out of their coma as potential people who aren't really people, or a person who was knocked out in a brawl as a potential person who is not (on some level) currently a person, and many other examples.
0	jito, i forgot to thank you for agreeing with me on eugenics. what is that?...the second or third time we have ever agreed? well, you have only 8,966 more things to agree on with me to show you have converted to proper thinking! emoticonxangel  consent is relevant when it is relevant. do you deny that women engaging in sexual intercourse (outside of rape or some other type of coercion) give consent to engage in an act that may result in pregnancy? i never said that sex was only for procreation and i don't believe it is. i do believe, however, that the procreative potential of sex must be respected. i do believe that when a being comes about as the result of a sexual act then that being should be respected.	and of course here you go wanting to meddle in the lives of others by telling all of us we only get to engage in sex for procreation.
0	Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.	then your argument too is flawed by the same principals of debate.
0	no, i completely agree. it's frustrating from a woman's point of view also. does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere, it's solely the woman's responsibility to take care of the child? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting.	i completely believe that fathers can be just as good parents as mothers, even better in some cases.
0	do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them? also you failed to address my point. is self-defense not a legitimate use for guns?	you can take them home, have them stolen and then used to commit a crime; or your son can take them to school and shoot a few dozens kids.
1	the nice part. i'm surprised that you've even read the bible. presumably you're commenting on 1 thessalonians 5:2, wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that.	:)  i am ready for judgment day..........as you know the bible says that death comes like a thief in the night.......well maybe your bible does not say that...sorry........
1	So if you were attacked by a 250 pound man who is an 8th Degree Blackbelt, you'd prefer a fair fight?	Also, a person has a change to run from those other things, admiittedly, a tossed rock can do damage, and if your opponent is especially hefty, a frying pan might fly a goodly distance, but it's the pure cowardly aspect of whipping out a gun that angers me, having a considerable advantage at a considerable distance.
1	Clue: It's there in your own sentence. Five letters, beginning and ending with "S". If you need further interpretive assistance, don't bother with Sarge, she's waiting for an original thought.	Perhaps you can demonstrate the link between swiss gun laws and a shooting in a swiss owned factory in missouri with an interpretive dance.
1	You can take a horse to water. I provided evidence to support my assertion. You provided ............ "Oh no it isn't!"	That's the front of the knee, what's that got to do with this argument.I've read the link, and just because it came out of Harvard doesn't mean that it's official or that it's of any measure of validity.
1	But religion is not a topic for science classes. Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative.	On the other side, you have the evolutionaist crowd, who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue.
1	you don't know? oh yeah... you're supposedly married to that teenager, prodigee.	who is dana and what does he have to do with whether these two countries are alike?
0	Well firstly we do not know that "volition" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.	My second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems, because a computer cannot model volition, the defining characteristic of life.
1	Therefore you accept that the Republican party almost as a whole is "grade A USDA approved Liberalism." About time you did.	First off, That's grade A USDA approved Liberalism in a nutshell.
0	Excuse me, but you didn't fully read what he wrote. He didn't say that he supported abortion. He said that he wasn't as much a freak about it as you're being.	You're automatically excommunicated if you support abortion and only can come back into the church via confession.
1	Oh, well, then that settles the argument doesn't it. It must be a person because she says so, now. Maybe she will change her mind again?	She now fights against the very abortion rights that her case aloud to make happen.http://www.illinoisrighttolife.org/2...cal_Impact.htm
0	why do you refuse to address the atf emails showing that they were building support for new authority to regulate and dictate firearms sales? they are truly right there, out in the open and viewable by literally everyone. why do you ignore them?	for those who think they can prove it: go ahead.
1	Atheism is a religion? Pray tell, where would I find the atheist church?Ridiculous.	Did you know that atheism is a religion, George?
1	Hang in here everyone, Bassman's been reading "_____"'s posts over and over and they've got him talking about the "American Holocaust"! emoticonXBanghead   Until you have been in my exact situation, I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand. I really don't give a emoticonXCensored if you think it is selfish or not - it is not for you to judge.	I do not give a tinker's damn about the reason nor circumstances.
0	The same could be said of Clinton.Tell me. How do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations?If a person like Sanford isn't exposed to his own medicine, how will he (or others) not recognize how it tastes?Furthermore, I find your perspective a little baffling.What he said "many years ago"? Is that something he should be embarrassed of, because he was wrong?Or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught?Cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard. It's a good standard.We have too many politicians who look out for their own interests, and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously.	es' past (from many years ago in fact) in their faces when they mess up.
1	i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.	if you are looking for me to say that 'abortion is ok in some circumstances', i can't do that unequivocally.
1	We all agree that abortion is "killing". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open "mind". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead.	The shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life.
0	First of all, when gun owners say ban guns, it means, if you want to ban ANY Gun, you are a gun banner! You guys want to muck up the argument with we don't want to ban all guns, just some guns! However, that statement is just for now! If you get the ban more will be following!   Nelson T. 'Pete' Shields -- Founder of Handgun Control, Inc.	I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources
1	You know you have outwitted a conservative thinker when they completely dodge the argument you have made.	But if you can't even see that then there is no reason to even attempt to discuss it with you.
0	I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting.	BTW - I don't think hell is a place, either.
1	this particular one, formulated the way it is, might well fail. that's why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is.  where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from 'controversial' issues? ooooo... that's a persuasive legal argument. i'm impressed (not). gay people have been 'earning it' for over 100 years. in the short-term, we may suffer setbacks, in the long-term, there's no stopping us. another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue. no matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, republican-appointed judges. of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom.	if the lawsuit makes it to the scotus, it will go down in flames.
1	and you shouldn't forget the thousands of gays incinerated at this death camp!!!	Did you forget that?In a similar way, sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.
1	you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions. woopdee fucking doo. but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. well done darling. but being an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of years with not the rest of their lives. now let's get back to the facts - where in an arranged marriage does it say the 2 people getting arranged don't have a choice?	but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with.
0	Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.	You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence, I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods.'
0	How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child. And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law. So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that, there is no question.	But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women.The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it's often taken to establish that abortion is murder, and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly.
0	oh yes this is all over the news in ireland. irish farmers are having a canary that its the end of ireland's sugar industry. and cereal too because of crop rotation. nobody seems to have even thought of the question as to why exactly the eu should pay for an unsustainable industry as oppossed to farmers moving into something profitable. edit: oh and its tied into something about sugar being one of irelands few natural resources. emoticonxbanghead	hopefully we can get out of this pointless business of propping up our inefficient and pointless agricultural sector before this century is over.
1	is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james.	want the list of military actions he engaged in as president?
1	That was someone else you were posting to about them "hammering" porn, whatever that means.Gay men watch hetero porn and thats the reason for so much gayness? Real logical.	nd so strongly, at least this proves that I'm right about the porn hammering.
0	wow that's an excellent bit of knowledge. i didn't know that about the ps updates, i only had 1 and 2 and i felt like the hassle of continually buying a new one was not worth the free internet. also, as for the red ring of death on xbox, i guess i wasn't an extreme enough gamer to let mine over heat.	you have some major titles that xbox doesn't have like infamous, ratchet and clank series, uncharted, god of war, the last of us, sly 1,2,3,and 4, jack and daxter collection, killzone, heavy rain, resistance, and others that i can't name off the top of my head.
0	Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups.	The KKK use of firearms isn't a legal and lawful use, as dictated in the Heller ruling.Next argument please!
0	And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.	The point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro-gun side is very doubtful.
0	They have. Prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction, almost 360 degrees around. Predator animals have their both eyes facing forward.	)It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies.
0	Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example.	Why would a book be right about the lives and events recorded in it and wrong about origin.
0	We are on due process now? How can you evolve how you deal with due process? Due process simply means that processes which are required by law. The court evolved this into substantive due process which is changing the meaning of the constitution. Do you deny substantive due process?	Look, what I said was that the courts have evolved how they deal with due process.
0	That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed.	However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.
0	I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.	Why should they kill a human being in the womb, whether this human being is Arab or not?
0	You mean to tell me it's a falsehood??   I don't believe it.	from here  from here  there are more.
0	gay dreams are pretty common among men, but it doesn't make them gay erm.. you've had dreams about having sex with men? i think you're kidding yourself if you think that's normal for a straight guy.	gay dreams are pretty common among men, but it doesn't make them gay.
1	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.	Then it's okay to lump all Christians together!Evidently, that makes it all better!So much for being a free-thinker.But then again, you never addressed the issue I asked you about slavery.You claimed to be moral, based on democratic ideals of moarlity... but democracy would have very likely continued slavery in the USA!It was Christians who aimed higher.
1	So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage.	Here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry, supposedly in "defense" of "traditional marriage," when some of them are out sneaking around, cheating on their wives, and lying about it when confronted.
0	It's a lot more than what you've come up with. What evidence do you have that indicates the Iraq population wasn't heavily armed? As for the Taliban, you're confusing Afghanistan with Iraq.	Come back when you have something of substance.
0	Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves.	The facts speak for themselves, and no amount of geneticist/darwinist hand-waving is going to change what they say.
1	I guess we just haven't shaken all of our Imperialist ways. After all, we've only been away from the British Empire for a little over 200 years.:p	I thought the US government mostly engaged in killing young black men (or rather middle aged black men once the appeals process is over), not old people.
0	There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored. Those that haven't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about. There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred. Those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles, are dubious at best, and are extremely rare. A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens. The point I was making is that if they existed we would see them.	--------------------------------------------------------------------------How are we to know that there has not been a few hundred,there are none in my neighborhood,how aboput yours??

0	Yes. The better question is, did it happen just like in Genises? I don't think so.	if there is no evidence that adam and eve or eden ever existed, did man really ever commit a sin that caused all of mankind to be fallen?
0	obama has 1 thing that palin certainly doesn't have is the fantastic ability to turn crowds in favor of him. obama has amazing speech abilities that surpasses palin without a doubt in my mind. palin also likes to go off subject almost as if she is avoiding certain questions.  what is experience if you cannot even thoroughly explain your position?	but it's unfair to say she doesn't have enough experience when she certainly does (or, at least more than obama did).
1	'they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.' oh yeah, us liberals are free to talk on fox...  we just aren't allowed to defend ourselves when our statements are taken out of context, correct you when you misquote or misread soemthing for the benefit of your stance on a topic, or have the last word.... other than that, we may speak....	while i will admit that most of the people on fox news lean towards the right, they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.
1	Yep, suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go. We should also get them to stop pooping.	Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior.

0	And Atilla's army of as many as 1/2 million men was beaten and forced into retreat by the Romans and Visigoths in 451AD. A year later, he was forced to make peace after devastating the Roman countryside...but NOT Rome itself.He died a year later in 453AD.	Even in the case of the Romans, such practices as decimation eventually led to their downfall.

0	Not all evolution takes place over billions of years. There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time. "bacteria, birds etcs."Natural selection occures frequently. You can "observe" evolution through the fossile record, DNA, morphology etcs.Evolution has made predictions, these predictions have come true, ergo, it's good.	#1 - How are we now able to observe evolution, when the evolution of the world supposely took billions of years?
0	You don't even take into consideration the possibility that Japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the US- if guns were freely available in that country. You have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you're trying to peddle.	That has happened before even in Japan as well as other countries including here.
0	however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many.	how do you know for sure if the emotion you choose is correct?
0	It's one thing that stands between us and a mindless theocracy. It protects the freedom of women from would-be ayatollahs who would make them sexual slaves.	For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.
1	Are you just not bright enough to make the connection between:	I never understand why you take a topic and just randomly make a comment which is barely based on anything in this entire thread.
0	up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms.	morality, in the strictest sense of the word, deals with that which is innately regarded as right or wrong.
0	Oh, probably about as many as there are killed by bayonet lugs, pistol grips, heat shields, detachable magazines, and folding stocks.	I wonder how many are exaggerated.
1	wow, you're clever. and some things are dumb. ex, choosing to die when you have the option to live. your lame analogies aside, (yeah, i used the word lame again) one can find new people to hang out with. and again, instead of answering my arguement, you decide to try and insult me. you're right, i must be the one who is dumb...	something is only dumb to those that cannot comprehend.
1	Reading Difficulties, huh?  There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there.....

1	my hat is off to california! was my post #43 right or wrong? now we just need new york to follow suit. now my question. if the federally funded programs can not create new stem cell lines, can california create them and then share? voila! federal funding on useful research. then watch 'em all stand in line for the cure. another question. has anybody else thought to ask gwb why, if stem cell research is false hope, did he fund any of it -- badly?	yeah, i heard they can get stem cells out of your teeth now.

0	is the legal aspect of it disputed or only whether it is immoral? i may be tooting my own horn, but this thread discussed the moral aspects of abortion in general, and this was my contribution. is that sort of what you're looking for?	i had to clear it with the theology department at my hs.

0	but that doesn't answer the question. why is dawkins a xxxxx to believe as he does? it seems that you have no answer except to throw out indiscriminate insults at people you know nothing about. in a previous post you stated, 'the guys a simpleton.' that doesn't make sense as there is no verb in the sentence. 'guys' is the plural of 'guy'. you don't seem to be aware that the contraction for 'guy is' is 'guy's.' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor's is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the 'e' and 'd' keys. do you have a better explanation for our origins that doesn't involve magic and dirt?	these are people who believe it and worship evolution like their religion as long as they don't have to believe in a personal god.
0	do you realize, that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being. back when birth control first came out, planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle. so they redefined 'life' to say that you had to draw breth. by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies? 'cause they sure like humans to me. you know most of them can already move before the abotion? look into the court hearings of judge ricard c. caey in new york. if you want to know the truth about abortion.	how is it not, there is one defining moment in life: the fertilization, after that there is nothing were fingers snap and its a baby.
0	While the current cannon was 'accepted' by the late second century, there were numerous other 'gospels' that existed by then, and were eliminated at the 4th century time frame. Most of those copies were destroyed, but some have been unearthed.	Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts, and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament, certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century.

I have been reading some of the replies on this page, and yes there is a very new valid way that creationists can explain the fact that we see stars that are billions of light years away in a universe that is thousands of years old.

0	For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all.	Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.

0	But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.	Most evolutionists believe that matter and time were created by a "Big Bang."

Pointing out a different word choice than you would have used doesn't appear to mean anything.If you are certain that their love is not real, why don't you explain your reasoning that led you to this conclusion? It seems to me that a gay person knows his own love better than someone who has never even met that gay person. Do you have some knowledge which disagrees?	since when did we start calling the person we are going to marry partners.
0	I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them).	Waiting until they are born likely gives them no more chance of surviving than killing them in the womb.
1	I'm sorry, did Article V have a clause I'm missing that says you can only amendment the constitution if it accomplishes more freedom?

Under a different circumstance than what you are talking about as in the 2A.
0	Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.	Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail.

1	I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.	The 1967 act "...allows termination of a pregnancy at any time if there is a significant risk of the baby being born seriously disabled.
1	Right, because besides rape and health concerns these really are the only other reasons women have abortions. emoticonXRolleyes	...(the OTHER 95%) who can't be bothered with a child or does not want to deal with stretch marks or fear their boyfriend may dump them.
0	Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.	Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?
1	Dont mind him, hes just sticking up for his new boyfriendemoticonXLove	Now, that is just plain cruel.
0	Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.	Do you not see how this could give the ILLUSION of evolution?
0	So?I look into the clouds and see a cow. Clouds aren't telling me to have a steak.	Alex found exactly the same sequence of primes linked to the same series of biblical messages.
0	No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as "proof" of a young earth.	you might criticize me for believing evolution happened simply because scientists say it did, but alas, thats the reason why.
1	I can neither confirm nor deny at this particular juncture that I may or may not be either male or female. :)	You MUST be a man.
0	Ah, you've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate. Sad, but predictable.       Obviously, I was discussing the entire article, which is making that argument. It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length.	Another lie.The sentence you've quoted never made any such argument.
0	The counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the Violinist arguments, at the very least. Whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story :P	Personally I don't believe in an absolutely rights-based system, but I'm interested in this in terms of the arguments used and whether they're logically sustainable.

0	And what is an inheritance? Proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life. 15 Good understanding giveth favor 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid. What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure.

0	And I would agree with you as long as all marriages for all couples were called civil unions and there is no two tiered system.	Well, at least they're trying to do it the right way, instead of finding some biased judges to render them some ruling.What I don't like though is the idea that civil unions can't be worked into a more doable institution.
0	Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there.	If you reject the literal account of the Creation in Genesis, you are saying that God is a liar!
1	Wow. I particularly like the part where you criticize someone for a lack of intelligence while making an elementary grammar mistake. It's you're not your.	Your pretty slow aren't you
0	Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by "higher" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.	It is just amazing that every creature on this planet didn't evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another.

0	So it is claimed.   Tiahrt Amendment Facts | ProtectPolice.org   I've noticed a pattern. Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so. They send a mixed message. It's happened before such as when the NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF. How can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better? It gives us a clue to what the gun lobby's true motives are. Truly disturbing.	tiahrt to holder: read the tiahrt amendment before drawing false conclusions
0	If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.	If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money.

0	Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.	I don't think there are many, who consider the fetus a person in the way you are implying, that are still for abortion "rights".The debate is not if its ok to kill a human being because obviously your not going to get a huge debate on that but rather is the fetus a human being.

0	if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex.	the distinction can matter, so if there is going to be promiscuity going on, i for one would perfer to see it be safe-sex, as much as possible.
0	Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone "up there" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify.	My moral compass does not care if genesis is literally true or not.

1	And have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my "soul mate." Yeah. I'm thinking if they're willing to make me go through that they're not a soul mate at all. >_>	To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day.
0	Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent.	Everyone not a literalist can see that the two accounts conflict when read literally.
0	Well of course everybody is entitled. But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color, using the "black codes" enacted after the Civil War. If it weren't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution, minorities would still be out in the cold.The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment.	I think everyone is agreed that people no matter what race are entitled to equal protection under the law.
0	Thanks, Clive, you're a good sport. Of course I can't agree with the idiot part. Rash, unwise, unknowledgeable, maybe, but not fools.	People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the "idiot" label.Hope this clarifies things for you.
1	I've got a better compromise. We'll keep our magazines in whatever size we please, and we'll ban you, J Miro, Simone, and a random forum troll to be named later. That sounds fair and even in terms of trade to me.	How about a ban on J Miro in exchange for a ban on high cap mags?
0	But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).	then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of, in the worst case, chaos and, in the best case, a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority.
0	And the reasons have been discussed at length and most of us agree about the mother's life being endangered or possibly in cases of rape and incest.........Where we disagree with you is unecessary abortions...such as for birth control, a headache on just and inconveniencce........You think any abortion is alright...We don't.....	There are reasons women choose to abort and those need to be addressed and there will also be cases where women need to abort (health concerns, rape, etc.
0	Well, since you have natural selection completely wrong, it must not go too well with the Biblical account. By the way, now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context. What is a "kind." Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a "kind." Please show why a "kind" only has the ability to lose information.	variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.

1	Where? I don't see it. My monkey brain's fine but my eyes aren't what they used to be.  I'm guessing we're through discussing the legality of armed self-defense in Australia given the flurry of OT links?	the other part about the gov't weapons finding their way into criminal and enemies of our country and the neighboring countries were thrown in to stimulate your little monkey mind.
1	So, is a giant Panda a bear? Or some other "kind"?	Sure, there are lots of kinds of bears, but they are still just that, bears.
0	Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.	But the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than that of criminals, thus less criminals will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person living there owning a gun.
1	lol...well why don't you use your brain and tell me how and why breasts formed then. why would they get selected for in the first place? ns can't see into the future. have any evidence of a reptile with breasts?	there are so many flaws and basic fundamental errors in reasoning here... i think my iq dropped an even 50 points just from reading it.
0	It's worse than that, Pandion. For example, here's what I told him over at ARN on the same subject back on April 5th. http://www.arn.org/ubbthreads/showfl...e#Post30331420	I'll leave it to you to search the peer reviewed literature for the several papers on the topic.
1	Just which god might that be? Yahweh? Krishna? he Great Spirit? Allah?  Please specify.	and the people who do that will have to answer to god in due time.
0	Why do conservatives support conservatives? Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas. Luke doesn't have him meet a risen Jesus only Paul says he did. His first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with Barnabas.But the Apostles did not teach the same as Paul, similiar but not the same.	It is not necessary that all the apostles should be equally inspired to only write teachings and letters like Paul, just like all the organs of a body do not take part of the same the function, but the nevertheless, all contribute to the making and building of the body.

1	archie, that wasn't a prophecy you neo marxist socialist, it was a hope. neo, marxist socialist, eh? three compliments in the same sentence. see you can be nice if you really really try. nice to know i am continuing the proud tradition that my parents established so many years ago. my father voted for debs, and my mother voted for foster. archie, sweetie, your flattery will get you nowhere, try as you might.	that wasn't a prophecy you neo marxist socialist, it was a hope.
1	i disagree with it because there is no god. these are your words: 'i propose that a standard of good or evil cannot be defined by humans or human constructs.' i guess i shouldnt be surprised that i cant get a straight answer. you dont know. i am surprised your 'god' has not provided you with more adaquate ansures.	i submit that you think it is 'too easy' just because you disagree with it.
0	Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called "womens issuses" be in valid?	Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.
1	I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?	8.I just love how Liberals like to twist this to mean that it's the government's responsibility to care for us via food (food stamps), income (welfare checks), Medicaid/Medicare/S-Chip, etc.
0	it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.	can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally (without going through selection) validates darwinism, which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted?
0	there's a fair few problems with this. off the top of my head... what happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child? what consequences would there be for a mother who didn't want to give the name of the father? would there be any? why is only the father punished? having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people. if it isn't consensual, rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs, why punish only one of the consenting individuals? on a more fundamental level: what evidence do you have that having an abortion is 'a mortal sin'? why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept?	will it fly with conservatives and progressives?
0	Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality.	You are in a loud minority, railing against the irrational hoards about you.
0	So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?  Your statement "An abortion never has to be done" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?	Mr. Jack, Abortion doesn't have to be done if the amniotic sack is cut.

1	About a third of the weapons seized in Mexico were referred to the U.S. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   About half were successfully traced. Better than 90% of those to U.S. dealers.   Of course your definition of "minute" might differ from mine.	The lie that was purported based on successful traces of the minute number of weapons Mexico turned over to be traced and identified, while keeping the vast majority from law enforcement?

0	please clarify what you're saying here as it makes no sense to me. what point are you trying to make ? off the top though, any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible doesn't condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act/lifestyle. and who does the anti-defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it.	you don't think we could find denizens of stormfront who would claim that they don't hate black people but they think it is sinful for white and black people to have relationships, and then point to, say, the anti-defamation league and accuse them of hatred?
0	I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.	I suspect, therefore, that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy.
1	This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)	A union between two persons having the customary but usually not the legal force of marriage: a same-sex marriage.
0	So atheism doesn't "need" facts? If it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution, doesn't it need all the facts? If the answer is no, then how can it argue against religion? Miller didn't explain it.	Religion= faith in a deity or deities (rough definition)  Atheism= lack of religion/deities  Therefore, atheism= lack of faith    There is no "faithful" beginning point of atheism.
0	You JUST said they get health care in the hospital! Read your post, where's there NO healthcare. And it IS based on the ability to pay...you just want me to pay for someone else's and in the most inefficient way possible.	We already have the cruelest form of rationing in the world, that which is based on the ability to pay.In LA, if you're rich, you get Cedar-Sinai.
0	I think this is a bad way to put it...the evidence that they earth has been warming since we have had the ability to measure temperature is overwhelming...the cause is unknown and whether or not it is natural is unknown. It does seem fairly narasistic to think in 100 years we have caused so much damage to an earth that at least has been here 10,000 years.	The evidence on global warming, however, is pretty overwhelming.
0	It's all in how you word the questions.You worded the questions with an obvious bias, they did not come across as an honest attempt to learn, but rather as a challenge.Word them properly, and I guarantee you that the people here will be most helpful.WaxyP.S. Your username has a large affect on how you are initially perceived.	It really piques me when someone attempts to assume what my opinion is without asking me.
0	Well, if you breed them, you could get taller monkeys with less hair (and other humanlike characteristics). Even so, it would take a long time.	In fact, the only feasible way that a tree-swinging monkey could change into a man would be through some freak accident (aka -- random mutations.)
1	i love how you are using violence to threaten people. when, your argument is disputing violence.	disagree with this and i'm going to beat the crap out of you.
0	Kronus said this was a win for science. He never mentioned that religion was discredited- never mentioned religion at all. Religion and science are utterly unrelated. Why would you make that connection?	When religion is discredited, is it a "win" for science?
0	The point is that there are plenty of issues that go on in church meetings and denominational conventions that are areas of enormous disagreeement and struggle. It happens--it's not just this issue. You just don't hear about them because the press isn't interested in those issues.	It "isn't controversial" because the vast majority of Christian sects HAVE NO PROBLEM with it.
0	Strawman. The argument is not to do whatever one wishes with ones body. The argument is soley that one does not have to have another attached, ever, against ones will.	The simple fact is, in a civilized society no one has the freedom to do whatever she wants with her own body.
0	Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.	You may not have intended to, but you've given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes, with regards to her family - and you'd stick out of it, regardless.
0	Yes. The assumption happens to be that maybe the bible isn't literal. "Lets look into ourselves, shall we?" Behold we did, and Lo! The Earth is old!	Like most other natural history museums today, the Museum of the Earth takes visitors on a journey through time, telling as fact “the 4.6 billion year history of the Earth.” But visitors will never get an opportunity to check the assumptions at the foundation of this story.

0	Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.	(Playing devil's advocate)And, by what authority would you deny a woman's "right to choose" an abortion that happens to be "late in her pregnancy?"
0	One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord.	They simply cannot figure out why so many missionaries go over to China and try to convert people.
0	And were THIS the 17th century, I might understand that, but this is the 21st century. We don't "bleed" people to make them well; we don't have barbers performing surgery and we usually have a trained physician in the delivery room.	This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth."
0	Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today.	"http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.htmlThis is quite clearly wrong as Darwin did use it in the 6th ed of Species.
1	Did you even notice that they were not the first to report it? Oh wait, you didn't because you are obviously using the fallacy of selective observation.	Newsweek should be punished by the World Court for inciting riots and causing deaths with a fraudulent story.
1	fend not really. they took it out because it was a blatant pro-christian argument.  and those two threads only serve to prove my point. the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims. there is no science in id. only godiddit.  explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong.  explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution, it's false. that makes no sense whatsoever.  explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted. or are all these products science brought us fake?  the delusion of creation.	both long and religious (in its own context).
1	Well with thinking challenged individuals like slimjim floating around it is no wonder we have a rogue agency with no oversight attacking the honest citizens. See Ruby Ridge and Waco for examples.	http://www.jpfo.org/docs/atf_1979.txt after reading hundreds of horror stories about these type of incidents it is not hard to see that ATF hasn't changed it's focus and goals any.
1	I guess I am just "psychologically conditioned" to be blue eyed.?	so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist?
0	You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.	And would society break down if some individuals are allowed to enter into a legally protecting penumbra institution we call marriage?
0	And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.Mo	I just say we make a law against abortion, and stop the genocide against the unborn.
1	How about the pass that the Clintonistas routinely gave to Bubba for his Oval Orifice tryst with Monica??	Or did you make that up so you could attack me since you have no argument?
1	shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such.	the government should only deal with 'civil unions', regardless of the gender of the individuals involved.

1	Oh, I agree....private security companies are the answer. Very republican of you.	Surely, in high schools and colleges there could be found several Batman types who would be proud to protect the general public from mentally deranged gunmen by carrying one himself...just in case.If it would save a bunch of lives by having a quick way to snuff out random shooters, I'd be all for an extra tax to cover it...and I hate taxes.
0	what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny.	i can't live in an assisted living center with my partner if/when that time should come, without marriage.

1	Get away? We never went near it in the first place.	hard to face the facts, i know... cant seem to get away from the fact that 3 babies die every second because of abortion.
0	truth can be found in god. we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not. for instance, one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone doesn't believe it how true is it? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math. 1 + 1 is 2, 12 inches equal a foot, etc. the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is.	truth can be both subjective & objective bryers choclate chip ice cream is the best in the world.
1	i'll agree with you on some of the things you said, but not the hired gun. america doesn't need to hire guns, we have our own. if what you are asserting is the case, then why would we be where we are right now. and are you saying that israel gets there weapons for free? this is america son, nothing is free if you haven't found out. and our strong ties with israel are more than likely due to the fact that they're more trustworthy than any of the arab nations, thus making a greater ally.	israel, as by far the single largest recipient of us military aid, direct financial aid and trade loan guarantees is the only one that comes to mind.
0	have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution.	personally i don't give rats rear end about your god - neither he, you, the government or the ignoramous in rome will ever have say in what happens to this body.
1	wow, in your very warped world view, people with moral values that defend the most defenseless among us and speak for those who can't speak for themselves are seen as morally perverted by you? how terribly pathetic of you capo. but sadly, i'm not the least bit surprised at how incredibly shallow your perspective is. what boggles the mind though is that you're unable to empathize with a whole class of human beings whom you once were yourself. just think about it capo, can you see what that say's about you?	the individual's right to control her own body, have security of her own person, cannot be imposed upon.

That does not mean, however, that we should refrain out of politeness from making statements of established scientific fact just because a listener might have been exposed to contradictory religious beliefs.
0	ridiculous. if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong. daewoo: ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind. id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. it failed. michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic.

Another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins.
1	Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbor's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competance.	Now, you're advocating that this is what God should do.
1	Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?	In your other posts it was a "baby" CUNx.
1	i love how the government has become the scapegoat for the failure of parents to control their kids, and in turn we are losing more and more civil liberties...	for kids being subjected to things on the internet shouldnt be the governments right to have them see certain things and not see others.
0	Do you have any evidence for that? And still, I don't know what you mean by kind.	God created all things in "Kinds" - a supergiant group.
1	why thank you , and yes i guessed that as you are pretty busy grovelling to the hide and seek champ , so full credit to you and of course the invisible dictator ..., don be shy take a bow .....	i know most of us christians have never heard a retort like that.

0	So much for your cover. Its blown. You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons. Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil. Maybe you will never know - in this life at least :(	well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.
1	how are you proving that when you have gone out of your way to ignore your failures?  tell me, does comic book art prove creationism? does tv props prove creationism? is oil a hydrocarbon? is density sorting in a fluid medium 'ludicrous?' does a theory that requires miracles work on a scientific level?  how is 'why' the same as 'what?' and since when does grammar depend on the person saying it rather than the statement being said? you claimed that taz did not screw up the grammar, yet i did. yet the statements were identical. how are you addressing what i said when you've completely ignored everything i listed?  more yelling. no actual argument.  the whole point of that was to show you make large numbers of asinine statements. do you reject that?  red bold statements don't make a winning argument.	or admit that you lie like this on a regular basis and distort my arguments in order to claim some sick victory which you never earn honestly but by doing what i am proving here that you have done by claiming that i ever said that bees can't fly!

0	Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods.	I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature."
1	In my case, it isn't 'god fearing'.. so much as "believer fearing'	And what exactly is a "God-fearing athiest" anyway?
1	Ah yes resort to attack when you have no case - perfect example. Its a marvellous demonstration of projection.	You are nothing but hayseed busy-body who revels in the belief that you have some sort divine, 'holier than thou', right to stick your nose into other people's business.
1	Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about.	Then they do things like lobby Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF according to Bob Ricker, a former lawyer of the NRA who turned against the organization.
0	And why would I be anti Christianity when I am Christian?   Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I don't believe in Jesus, or something to that extent, I never said anything to that extent, you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it. I believe in the teachings of Jesus. Yes I'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible, My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times. So she's told me all about it, and what its supposed to teach us.	Anyone who finds themselves foolish enough to believe Hitler was a Christian, for whatever reason you want to believe, needs to look up the word 'propaganda.'
1	Actually, I don't sneer at you. I laugh at you. And I don't attack your intelligence but your knowledge. You are intentionally ignorant.	They sneer down at anyone like me who doesn't agree with them.

0	why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different.	if you don't want another mouth to feed then just take birth control or use a condom.
0	i'm a little surprised- i've found that pot smokers are usually the least pushy. usually they're laid back enough to just offer, unless they forget to offer. i've only ever been pressured to drink by one person, and that's all the peer pressure i've received. i'm not sure if it's the people i hang with, who almost all use something but are very laid back, or if it's that i'd be hard to ressure so that people don't try. what's your experience been?	weed was by far the hardest for me to quit, since it kind of immerses you in the subculture.
0	that is not true. a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural. an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal. the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed, just that they defy physical law. the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven	The same goes for any diety, or imaginary thing, if by definition they are imaginary/supernatural.
0	You know, this little phrase, "minutes before birth," keeps popping up in reference to abortion.Could someone please explain to me the point of having an abortion "minutes before birth"? What is the point?How many, if any, of this sort of abortion is performed?Could I get a really honest answer to that? Please, no lies.How many?Can anyone tell me?	.The irony is that we all fall somewhere on the line of pregnancy from no abortions at all to minutes before birth.
1	go out there and find all kinds of democrat-led, black-led, white-led, mexican-led, etc.. efforts to protect gay rights. just because you can't find them doesn't mean they're against them. saying all republicans are against gay rights because one of them is, is bigoted, stereotypical and childish. quite moronic too. is it also your claim that all blacks are prejudiced because they haven't formed the naawp yet? grow up.	go out there, find all sorts of cases of gop-led efforts to protect gay rights and rub our faces in it!!!
1	WHAT??? Jito, are you saying that motherhood is difficult? emoticonXWow Now that's a shock...	And that is just at home.
0	So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life. Care to give any examples, or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever?	It is our contention that it's the pro-death advocates who misrepresent the facts in order to justify their infanticidal proclivities and justifications as they release women of all personal responsibility and expect the innocent child to be sacrificed at the alter of their immoral lifestyle so they can continue to act irresponsibly.
0	...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers.	i do believe that the predictions are accurate, but i say 'no' for two reasons: one, stopping the event would create a paradox.
0	i'm surprised that they still have that on their website after bellesiles was proven to be a fraud. what do you mean by the dates?	can they be that stupid?
1	You and your spiritually-challenged friends are obviously too stupid to understand the difference between a cult and Biblical Christianity.	Remembering those conservative Christians who committed "revolutionary suicide" at Jonestown, 33 years ago today.

0	i have heard that you can easily find a marriage license copy online and without having to pay a fee. is this true? i would love to get a copy of my deceased parents' marriage license if i can. it would be a nice thing to frame and to keep on the wall to remember them by. so, can you find copies of marriage licenses online or is this just an urban myth?	interracial couple denied marriage license in la.
1	I could have labeled my post "TRAP" and you wouldn't notice. Tell me, are these two contradictory:	I don't want anyone to have to suffer injustice, however if one group is going to pass laws they need to make sure they are subject to those laws.Everyone can commit murder and be subjected to murder laws.
1	That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod.	18 fun challenges for evolutionistsCarl Sagan, the modern-day evolutionary spokesperson has admitted: "The information content of a simple cell has been established as around 1012 bits, comparable to about a hundred million pages of the Encyclopaedia Britannica."
1	But rather than be honest about your mistake, you just changed things without paying any attention to the fact that we've shown you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to the claims of the scientific community.. at least, not until somebody tells you. (And you accuse me of not having a teacher's mentality as I educate you in something you didn't previously know... How pathetic.)	Now if you come back with evidence that Neanderthal buried their dead, and deduce from that a direct relationship with modern man, then surely some chemical relationship has also been discovered since the advent of DNA technology, whether it it nuclear or mitochondrial similarities/connections, or one of the other chemical relationships mentioned above.
1	i love how what you 'personally' feel is in direct conflict with acedemic studies. science says force = mass times acceleration, but i personally feel that force = velocity times volume, so that must be the right answer.	they should be taught just the basics, and children if they are interested can talk about it with their parents or older friends.
1	Is your thinking really this simplistic? Either I have to agree with you or I am an anarchist? Is that all the complexity you can handle? This or that? Black or white? The best soda in the world is Sprite and everything else is wrong? What a boring little pigeon-holed world you live in.  No harm no foul - that is where I stand on sex and romance. Kids, animals and those who don't or can't consent are off-limits. K? Now that I have established (AGAIN) how I feel on that matter, let me reinstate.  Any God that allows love and intimacy for only a select group is viscious.	a god of anarchy is not one i'd want to have anything to do with.
1	I suspected as much, well part of my job then is to ignore and make snide comments to people who don't come to debate :)	I don't come here to debate, I come here to make fun of frauds like you.
1	Sorry, I was busy looking at your Base21 source, the one where you post your own article. I figured someone had made up an article on it.   Hey, according to PNC=WW3, if I don't like the people who put the information into the State Dept. website, I don't have to believe it. That's according to him.	You accuse "liberals" of spin?The first site that listed NK as being a state sponsor of terrorism was given to you in post #31 right after you asked for specific evidence to counter each point, AND AGAIN IN POSTS #37 AND #42, in which I actually copied and pasted the entire article.Further to that, is it my fault you were incapable of finding the info posted in the "second horses mouth" link when it was right under your nose in the first State Dept.
0	The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough.	the child in the womb feels pain..when you put the needle up there to try to give the child anestesia in the womb, the child moves away to not get stuck by the needle.
1	This is a laughable oversimplication of reproduction. Humans don't make copies. Do you reproduce asexually? I know I don't.	nothing new can be created by making copies, i've addressed this many times
0	The laws of physics are short, descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way. Many times the "laws of physics" have been amended by further information, causing the law to be restated.Actually, I think he meant the way that we have observed the universe and all of nature to operate.	Explain what you mean by the laws of physics.
0	But if the repeated tests just confirm the same errors or misinterpretations of the results, all of the independent reviews in the World wont make a difference.	that can then be repeated and that can withstand independent review.
1	No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is.	This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart.
0	Actually, the majority of my first post in this thread came from Robert H. Churchill's article who is an advocate of the individual rights interpretation.	They have an agenda, and that agenda is to persecute, I mean rewrite history about the 2nd Amendment.
0	I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.	What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates.
1	yes, that is certainly going to stop you from a gunman. 'dear god.... please save this soul'	if your a hunter and you want to kill a deer, then go and by a rifle, but do you really need an ak-47 to kill a little deer?

0	You realise I'm talking about if the burglar is running away, not the householder, right? Looking at it again I realise I may not have phrased it clearly enough. I'm saying that some of those "violent" crimes may simply have been burglars pegging it when disturbed.	Brooklyn's 81st Precinct probed by NYPD for fudging stats; felonies allegedly marked as misdemeanorsNew York cops 'fudge' stats like the Tories to make their "strict gun laws" look more compatible to the States that do not have draconian anti gun laws and need not depend on the cops protecting you when they have no duty to do so.I have been following UK stats for a long time and no matter who is in power, the crime rates increase.
1	And that would make you the one that IS advocating the murder of our future generation.	Well, you ARE the one advocating the murder of physicians.
0	quiet the opposite. fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back. molecular biology, geology, radiography do so as well. where do you get the idea that there is no evidence? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us. shoulder's of giants, hun. it is observed. you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype. remember, most mutations are innocuous. not so. only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms (bacteria) situations the 'chances' are very much in favour of it happening. remember, mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random.	again, the chances of- a random mutation allowing multiple (i assume there was more than 1 survivor) organisms to digest a synthetic material that happens to be dumped where they are- are very much against it
1	Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental, nebulas natural selection, or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric.	There's no need for some omnipotent (impossible) God.
1	Your definition of "Godly wisdom" is agreeing with your political positions and your spurious theological justifications for them, so it's hardly surprising you don't encounter any liberals who you think have "Godly wisdom"	If anyone thinks liberals are overly intelligent compared to conservatives just look at California and New York, and that elitist turkey in the White House, who's bankrupting the country.There are undoubtedly many intelligent liberals, but the ones I've seen are a full quart low on Godly wisdom.
0	When is wealth redistributed on a whim? The NHS is one of the few good things to come out of WWII and is the mark of a fair society (if you ask me).

1	And you're mentally disturbed. Didn't I say that there is no such thing as a "ex-gay"??? Did I stutter?You can pretend that denial is a river over in Egypt. Somebody thinking that they can successfully "supress" their true orientation, and deny themselves homosexual contact, is delusional..because the truth will always come out..because that's what the truth does. Show me an ex-gay, and I'll show you a liar. Where are they, that I can query them? I'll wait.	They may be "gay" physiologically (whatever that means in terms of biology), but they are living in a way that doesn't give in to that--which is what matters from their religious standpoint.
1	Actually that was obvious based on your type of irrational reasoning.	I am a dirty little democratic liberal for those that care.
1	Then you should be able to post some numbers that show I am wrong. I had absolutely no problem whatsoever finding and posting numbers that show I am wrong.Whipping? Are you on crack, easy? You and your buddy have been completely smacked down here. You have spewed a bunch of rhetoric and BS and been repeatedly shut down with hard FACT.Why dont you go get a high school diploma so you can at least understand basic math...heck...for that matter, a grade school diploma would ensure you had all the math skills to understand how silly your position is in the face of the facts.	You might want to go get a college degree and educate yourself so you can run with the big dogs.

1	If the rejecting of the "lifestyle" results in death, beatings, job displacement, eviction, insults or inequality, then what would YOU call it? "Religious moral code?"	It is no shock that if you have a religious moral code that rejects a lifestyle then you would then reject that lifestyle.

0	Sorry to inform you, but until you are 18 years old in this country, you are not granted full protection of your rights under the constitution of the united states. I don't agree with testing either, but saying that it violates your rights is not a valid argument.	Now, to get on topic, I believe a students rights are breached, without question when random or school wide drug testing is performed.
0	You/he could just have said 'slippery slope' in the first place; that argument is an old one, which I though was dealt with a long time ago. You can't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will, secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A. You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance.	You wouldn't make this statement if you knew about how Britain's current gun control laws came into existence.

1	and you don't think 9/11/01 was and attack on this country huh? emoticonxrolleyes  you are exactly the kind of liberal carl rove was talking about in his speech the other day.......	we were attacked in ww2, a big difference when compared to us attacking a third tier country using lies and deceit.
1	Do you have any New Testament passages to back these up - or were you just interested in having a rant?	It's one thing to live in accordance with your beliefs, it's something entirely different to make others live by your rules.
0	Really? I suspect that you have been duped by creationist ministers. There is no hype about Miller/Urey. It was an interesting experiment that demonstrated possibilities.	But there was a big evolutionary hyp over this and some people were saying "They are just that close in showing how life could come from non-life."
0	This has everything to do with guns,how are these people suppose to protect   themselves?Since the police have been told to just let them go, crime will run   rampant, it will become THE place to go if you feel like duing a little robbery a little burglary,gosh wonder if they gotta let rapo's and killers runaway to.   Only 2000? I lived in George Wa. and the population was less than 2000,it was also just off I-90 and we had plenty of crime from people passing through not   necessarily from people who lived there.	what's this to do with guns?
0	In what universe is there a right to murder?Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.What certain activities are forbidden in public?Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.	Here are just a small number that come to mind:1) Right to murder2) Right to own slaves3) Right to rape4) Right to abusing children5) Right to vote6) Right to smoke (if you're under 18)7) Right to drink (18th Amendment)8) Right to engage in certain activities in public9) Right to drive as fast as one wants10) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest riverThe list goes on really.
1	Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the "right" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say "All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages". Since we have "a government for the people by the people", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people. You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else.	I am saying that if so religious XXXXX wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then I want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief.

1	really? is the aaas a non-scientific organization too? hope you don't read the journal science because it isn't good enough for you.  you just choose to attack the source because it disagrees with your viewpoint. don't let science get in the way of your fanatic beliefs. emoticonxgood  if it isn't a peer-reviewed journal than why does it have to be reviewed by two experts in the field? why is the journal associated with the aaas? why do you attack the source and not offer one that supports your view? is it because you can't provide evidence for any claim you make or because you enjoy the taste of sand? keep digging that hole dane.	as i showed, it is not a scientific, peer-reviewed journal, but rather a membership journal you pay for publishing in, ie.

0	Pretty good considering Darwin wasn't aware of genetics. Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859. The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms.	How, though Darwin is often credited with citing "overwhelming evidence" for his theory of natural selection, all he actually provided was "one or two imaginary illustrations" of how the process might work
0	Which, we suppose, in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever, right?Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs.Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?	funny that all proponents of abortion for unwanted pregnancies talk about abortion as if being a political statement: I control my body.Funny that they never think that the reason most women need an abortion was because they couldn't control their legs and kept them crossed.They can not control their lust, so much for body control.
0	Because Africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. There are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. Their food sources are different, their territories are different. The more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. Pretty straightforward, really.	And isn't the dark Continent also the natural and original ecosystem where the Great Apes are from?

1	So did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words? You are the first mind reader I have encountered here. And considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science. According to you all science should be terrible. Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful?	You realized you just bolded a statement saying that science had nothing to do with "them" accepting evolution (a "material explaination") right?
0	Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.	The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*.

The 'rule of thumb' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood, the more offspring that species has.	Are only a few people in this generation "fit" enough to go on to breed?
0	Since evolution is a non-theistic theory (it does not consider if there is a god or not), you will have to look at some like http://www.theistic-evolution.com/I would also look up Kenneth MIller on the web... a highly Christian biologist who defends evolution.	I do not mean like those awful websites that misrepresent science to try and shoehorn the world into their Bible stories (sorry to pick on Christians here, but it is Christian ones that I notice), but ones that look at real science and look to see if a theistic explaination works for things?
0	Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.	So limiting the capacity has no affect on crime.
1	I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation. PS...from "our" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain.	Sorry, but that is nothing but hearsay from our point of view.
1	Considering what the TOE says, if a dolphin ever gave birth to a chipmunk, it would disprove evolution.	Just because Dolphins start using tools doesn't mean that one will give birth to a chipmunk!Get real, evolution is a fairytale!!
0	ah i see. so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to, unless they pay the government more money? sound a little too much like bribery to you too? and how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing? how about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society, and let people kill themselves/ruin their lives if they want to. why should i be spending tax dollars (ok, well hypothetically, pretend i pay taxes) to force someone else to not hurt themselves? sound a little counter-productive? and then we complain about a defecit? (obviously that's not the main culprit of spending, but you get the point).	furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drugs, which would be a good thing.
0	I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.	Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.
0	I'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion. Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young. Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful.	But if you do, make sure you protect your identity.
1	depends on what you mean by 'history'.  did george washington really cut down the cherry tree? that is fiction. did george washington exist? that is documented.. and is history.	don't you think this is a better definition?
1	Exactly, they are big on condeming the sins of those other guys. It makes them feel better about themselves. Also, it is always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homos are not going to disappear, abortion will never be made illegal. That's how the religious right recruits folks - get 'em all indignant about the "others" and they never notice they are being fleeced by the fat little pastor.	(I'm going to have to borrow that story... :p I can't help but wonder for some people if the reason they "mature" on the issue of heterosexual sex has to do more with the fact that they start wanting to do it themselves.A desire to partake in the action, as opposed to actual mature development, causes them to shift their attitudes towards heterosexuality.To me, that's one of the reasons Christianity (in general) has such a "tolerance" for divorce, which Jesus spoke out against explicitly, while not as much tolerance for homosexuality.They want to do the divorce thing or sympathize with the desire for it, so suddenly it's more "tolerated"... emoticonXRolleyes
0	'diversionary tactic'? the topic was 4 july and independence day. out of curiosity, did gw sign the declaration of independence? was he the first president? he didn't lead a bunch of rebels and militia? i never said you were a socialist, that you were educated in socialist schools. the result is evident. you don't have the fortitude to go to nara and read the truth in our history archives yet you snipe around trying to change the subject which is independence day. if it happened once before in can be repeated not only here but in other countries as well...and it is!	would you care to explain how my quoting of general washington, the first president of the us, led you to believe that i'm a socialist?

1	Am I suppose to take that as an insult or just a passing remark,hmmm?	And that is the difference between activists and pathetic, small minded, conformists.
0	I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. Any thoughts on this?	In particular, I'm not sure about your conclusion here:"The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken.

(in fact he defended separation of church and state.) the text of the speech is here (among plenty of other places accessible via google search) for people to draw their own conclusions.	i think he basically intimated that only believers have anything of worth to contribute to american society, and that the separation between church and state was a bad idea.
0	What do you mean by other definitions? Before you stated "Creation is...." thus it is implicit in this that you are arguing against a single homogonous construct.

0	Quite frankly, that makes absolutely no sense.So conservatives in the blue states will buy more porn because why? Cause they are in a blue state?And liberals in the red states will buy more porn because why? Cause they arein a red state?Your excuses lack any cogent theory behind the scenario.In science, when people put forth a hypothesis they provide a basis for their claim as to the mechanics of the phenomenon.But with you, you just throw out different ideas with no basis.	In no way did I say that either party purchased the most porn, nor did I differentiate between red and blue states.
1	So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.	That will take the criminals off the street and with them off the street there are no gun control concerns.
0	This isn't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise. Once out of the womb and living on his/her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb. Much like you can drive but this 'right' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything.	I put to you that you are the one discriminating on the basis of someone's size and development, since you would have it that a small, slightly developed person has a right to inhabit a womb, while a fully grown adult does not.

1	So lets see, you referred to how the 1st amendment applied to the states, posted the 14th amendment privileges and immunities clause and then asked if I thought something was unclear. Of course the privileges and immunities clause is often mistaken to have incorporated the 1st amendment by people who don't know what they are talking about but this is merely coincidence because you randomly quoted part of the 14th amendment but implied it all. Now if I changed it to what it said above would you feel that is an accurate statement? Probably, considering you don't seem to understand a blatant difference between "original understanding" and "original constitution).Your pride ruins you my friend.	14th amendment: "The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law..." Is there something in that you find unclear??
0	i see some names that don't seem to fit. c.s. lewis was a writer and scholar, you want to include tolkien too? aristotle was a prolific thinker but hardly conservative. it is as if you are trying to graft liberal (proper use of the word) philosophy on to traditionalism. you have rand, do you mean rand paul or ayn rand? quotes about the size of government from conservatives and founder types... it is the size of government that matters, not necessarily how it is financed. - dan mitchell senior fellow in political economy, the heritage foundation my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. - jefferson government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one. - thomas paine  what do you have to say about the 'proper' size of government?	who said what you claim conservatives say?

0	That's not true -- actually, it doesn't make sense. Science is just a bunch of rules (by definition). "Biology uses science to study life" is true. "Physics uses science to study the physical world" is true, but "science's purpose is to study life" is not true.	its difficult to merge life in its purest form with science, even though science's purpose is to study life.
1	True until proven otherwise eh? Xcaliber and you must get along great.You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.No logician (and by extension no good scientist) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'.	I think this paragraph should answer your questions thoroughly.

0	Well, assuming that when the Bible says "you" in passages that are telling "you" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says "women and men have souls." This doesn't mean they don't have them.Same thing with animals. The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says "you" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says "animals don't have souls."So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).	:)I didn't say it, nor does the Bible, that only males of the human race have souls.

0	People have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions. Many people once believed that the earth is flat:perhaps some still do. But this has nothing to do with scientific truth.There is no "version" of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities.By definition, scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment. Any law, knowledge, etc. thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account. All science in this sense is provisional.The apostles may have believed that Jesus walked on water: that does NOTmake it true.	Sure, it's got a lot of believers, but historically it is not the only vision of science people have believed in.There is metaphysical evidence.

And if not, (the more important question) how would they determine what constitutes civil rights. (Which you didn't answer, but rather basically said 'I don't know but rest assured they do' (to paraphrase). Get it now?

The point is that letting blacks marry whites didn't fundamentally redefine marriage, because it was still between a man and a woman.	Back in 1967, "societal views of marriage" meant SAME RACE MARRIAGE ONLY, by an overwhelming majority that supercedes that seen today against gay marriage.

0	A more precise term would be "broaden," since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, "diluted" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only "change" would be to other  people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only "change" in that regard will be the fact that they are  encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.	Change the definition of a legal term, something that is done daily, to benefit a class of citizen currently discriminiated against legally and socially.

"Thanks to the hard work of 1,200 volunteers in 138 different cities and towns -- in nine weeks time -- we filed petitions with the names of more than 38,000 South Dakotans who are calling for the repeal of the extreme abortion legislation enacted by the South Dakota legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds on March 6. http://www.sdhealthyfamilies.org/
0	Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again.	What does this have to do with what you started out with.
0	They were both created on the sixth day according to Genesis 1.	(I couldn't find the part about them being created "together".)
0	True, but I was referring to psychological explanations, not genuine reasons.	'The bible is scientific nonsense, therefore there is no god' is not a logical stance.
0	Nearly all the food humans eat today, even in the Western world is GM including maize, tomatoes, and soy, etc, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk. Essentially everything is with the exception of "organic". However, as i noted above, I wouldn't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick. I haven't read from all sides, however.	you may, but firstly, that argument may well not fly - much of the grain going to these animals is essentially the trash left over from other production to begin with, unfit for human consumption.
1	Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you	I'll prove to you on a future post how Neandertals developed their traits -- including their bone structures through a nonrandom mechanism.
0	Anyway Duo_Maxwell this isn't only creationist debaters, there are many more who do the same thing with different debates. you also forgot7. Make random accusations of logical fallacies when they have no idea what they even mean. Example: You said that my spelling is wrong, that's the biggest strawman I've ever heard8. Correct spelling mistakes and convienantly not answer the question. Example: "What do you thinkk of carbon dating?" "you spelled think wrong". If you want to correct spelling, fine but answer the question as well.	)The only thing classical ad-naeseum is your own preconceived idea's of creationism and creationist.You don't want to debate the issues like normal civil people, you just want try to make fools of creationists.
0	To be more accurate, (not something noted amongst the pro-gun rabble) the right of protestants to have arms for their defence against catholics.I think we've all seen quite enough of this "defence" in Northern Ireland. (assuming that yanks can locate the place with a map emoticonXRolleyes )	The English government has effectively abolished the right of Englishmen, confirmed in their 1689 Bill of Rights, to "have arms for their defence,"
1	Wow, everyone's just shakin' in their boots that your imaginary god will magick them off the earth! emoticonXKillemoticonXKillemoticonXKillemoticonXBanghead	If you weren't so consumed with your illicit gay sex escapades to read the NT you would have known that.Keep screwing around and God himself just might take you and/or your buddy Jazy off the earth like he did with Annanias Sapphira in the Book of Acts.
1	so you are saying that this country is based on principles of judaism? that is a date, dummy. it is not a founding principle. it was how dates were done. and 'our lord' could have been mohamed for all you know, except that it was the standard for dates. no christian principles. so at least you admit that you can't give a single location and that you can't even tell me how many times god, jesus, and religion are mentioned.	not the lord, but our lord!
0	Socialsim and Communism in the Soviet Union failed because the USSR spent its entire existence recovering from war. The country was bombed to hell by Germany twice, around the time of the world wars. The united states put unspeakable amounts of money into their war machine, which forced the Soviets to do the same. I, for one, would buy a gun If I knew my neighbor had six, and he wanted me dead.The CIA and American military carried out immoral operations in 60+ countries since 1945. The soviet KGB, as far as I know, has only been in Germany, korea, China, and Afgahnistan.	1989, the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down, along with Soviet Ideology.Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it.
1	so the quickest way to get over 20,000 points is to not be serious? check!	yes..., this is how i got 21,157 points..., and counting ;)
0	You can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. There are very many forms of evidence.	Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms.
1	That is exactly what he is here for. To spread god's.. 'love'.	Why does they admin let EZ post comments like this to other people, if he can't be vicl and debate like an adult to others, why is he here......to spread god's love ...right?
0	i love that you guys dont seem to be joking when you talk about it being offensive to gays - if anything i would think only tom cruise would find it offensive - because of his claims that he isnt gay (obviously untrue) gays would probably cheer if he (along with his penis) would come out of the closet if someone would find this offensive, it wouldnt be me vs gay guys - it would be me vs overly sensitive and selfrighteous guys who happen to be gay	i also think 'tom cruise's gay penis' is a bit too offensive toward gays and i would never have that name because of that.
0	Really? A human can be determined scientifically. Personhood is a human legal construct. You cannot prove scientifically what a "person" is.	If we can prove a person was at a crime scene through DNA evidence.
0	lazy jason, darling, but you very sadly lack one item of attractiveness, the freshness and beauty of innocence.	i have to carry a razor blade tucked under my thigh because so many of these 'beauty' queens try to top my glamor.... sorry sister there's no gold for second place... well if you studied math you'd know that two second place little runner ups does not beat one.
0	Lurch, I don't appreciate your condescending tone. If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions, you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin's Black Box.	If you want to challenge my assertion that these are transitional you will need to understand a bunch of words that you may have never heard before, like furcula, carina, hallux, gastralia, pubis, fibula, fenestra, pygostyle, and so on.
1	Spoken like a true Conservative, not one of those liberal "compassionate conservatives". emoticonXGood	You have two completely different things in your question so, I'll just split them up.Social programs (armed redistibution of wealth).I only agree with those allowed by the U.S. Constitution or by the respetive state constitution.
0	originally posted by fracas only way to be more efficient is to continue to wage war preferentially against technologically similar sides are we back to a us-eu war? sorry i took that the wrong way, but regardless, the kind of thinking that leads to wars and seeing who has the largest most powerful military is precisely what i'd like to get away from in order to advance the military. yes we learn from war, but its wasteful, i'm proposing a not so wasteful military.	you have a penchant to create strawman; never said we should wage constant wars what about one every decade or so?
0	while i can't say i'm a history buff, i'm not shocked about all that either. perhaps it's because i'm mostly a misanthropist.	but at the same time requires that same government to be genuinely benevolent which doesn't happen 9 times out of 10 when you give a person or group of people that kind of power they will abuse it.
0	It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. "Macro" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different.	I point out what stuck out to me...What I saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed "recent immigration," than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time, unless I misinterpreted it.
1	So you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? That someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? What if it where your nipples? After all nipples on men serve no purpose.	Geez, your not normal if you don't have it circumcised.
0	honestly, i am amazed, so there are actually gay people with a sense of reason. i have spent years of facing discrimination from narrow minded homosexual activists and all these years later, you are the only one that has ever demonstrated somewhat of a sense of reason beyond the same old hogwash i have seen demonstrated by thousands i have interacted with. i still have my reservations towards suspecting that somehow you might be attempting to set me up for a slam.	all i did was say his statements actually have some validity.
1	so basically, what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever. they shouldn't teach tolerance, because that offends the intolerant; they shouldn't teach racial equality, because that offends racists; they shouldn't teach religious freedom, because that offends religious bigots. maybe they shouldn't teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers.  i am truly surprised to hear a right-winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum. but then, i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today.	now, you and i don't agree with that, but the question here is whether or not the school should teach about issues that moralistic ones in peoples' minds, such as this one.
0	Because we view it as something much more than just a gravy train from the govt., that's why.For you it seems to be about the word, and the govt. saying "oh, you use THAT term ("marriage"), ok we recognize it." For us it's about the commitment.	Then why are you and other "antis" so hung up on preserving it for your exclusive use?
1	Big Bear, ye mae be thinkin' o the Mennonites. Er the Hutterites, er the Amish. Er mebbe the followers of thet Zwingli feller.	Isn't there some evidence that shows that the early Church was communist(notice the small c) in nature ?
0	The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life.	The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic.
0	arafat is not a worse leader than sharon... arafat steals millions in aid money that is suppose to go to the palestinians, which 80% of them are below the poverty line. arafat advocates people to xxxx themselves up so that they may kill as many jews as possible. he is the head-figure of many of these terrorist groups and pours millions of aid into them.  sharon is worse? not only has arafat contributed to many more than 1,000 israeli casualties, his 'intifada' has continued the cycle of violence and thus caused the death of more than 2,000 palestinians.	but arafat is not a worse leader than sharon...
1	Probably neat excuse. Do you expect jim to back that claim up? emoticonXGood Don't hold your breath.	Any evidence to support this or is it just a neat excuse not to take any action?
0	The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science.	The problem with ID is that there is no evidence, and it is simply not possible to falsify it.
0	1 - It is innacurate. We allow killing in times of war, in self defense, and in state sanctioned executions. So we already have a situation where, when given X mitigating factors, it is justifiable to take a life. It is impossible to say all life is equal, and then to apply that as law. People will be outraged. I know I would be.2 - Objective to who? Who gets to decide how valuable life is? And why should they get to? And who says they are right? The relative value of life works fine, thanks very much.	If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?
1	And refusing to donate your resources is killing, so I have killed someone by not donating my blood etc.	Jessica,What do you not understand Jess?
1	honk! wrong. my parents inherited a house from their parents. they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values. concepts stored in one brain, expressed via words and encoded in a new brain. epigenetic inheritance, yet still materialistic. doesn't mean they didn't also inherit a bunch of genes, and for the umpteenth time it doesn't mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like. shouldn't i be asking you that, since that's what you say happens, despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up? honk! what a great big fat juicy lie, ss. don't put it in the keep net though; toss it back so you can use it again later.	(how exactly does it happen that thought or awareness generates a new physical trait and then pass it down?)
0	So what? I don't care! Gun ownership is an individual right and that's the end of it! You don't have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the Constitution.	"The opportunity for a law-abiding gun owner to use a gun in a socially desirable manner--against a criminal during the commission of a crime--will occur, for the average gun owner, perhaps once in a lifetime.
0	wow, you're only 17? i definately had you in mid 30's maybe early 40's.	if the user does not have a brain, then obviously it, just like bread knives, stairs and folding umbrellas, is dangerous.
0	Cars are a privilege, your gun isn't. Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional.	Having to register guns will inevitably lead to a complete ban on guns, just as automobile registration has led to an outright ban on automobiles.
1	Where is your "proof" that a magical being in the Heavens created us ?	What evidence are you looking for that it exists?Hey – You guys say man evolved.
0	having been raised in texas as a child and teen, with many relatives still residing there, i'm surprised their educational system hasn't gone to the bible as its primary textbook. perhaps things have changed, but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas. maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed, but i'd find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique.	emoticonxconfused i didn't say that, our teacher didn't show us the texas version, just jokingly told us about it.
0	It is horribly oppressive of women, though, to oppose both abortion and contraceptives. That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all.	You can believe it all you want...If you don't believe in abortion and you don't believe in any kinda of birth control then that is your belief...it doesn't contradict itself.
0	i think in the mind of a psychopath with boundary issues, what the woman was wearing, or where she was at does not matter at all. how do you explain people who get raped in their homes? how about people who aren't dressing slutty, they're just having a drink with a friend, but that friend turns out to have a darkside? i really hope you're joking though.	they didn't follow these #safetytipsforwomen or else they'd have all been fine.
1	be sure and count the number of hits vs. the number of misses of some well trained leos. sap, remember your postition you took now on citizens might miss and hit some innocent person? read 3 or 4 versions of this shootout and learn something! lots of useful information in there.	all of these are interesting reads about the fbi shootout with two perps.
0	You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.	This means that murderers who don't get birthday cakes, a basketball court, tv, and a turkey for Thanksgiving go crying cruel and unusual punishment and then they get it.I've heard that the average cost of living of a capital punishment prisoner is appoximately $25,000.00 a year paid for by us.It's really bad when murderers on deathrow in Mexico are calling murderers on deathrow in America p*****s and want to transfer here.LEVIATHAN
1	And I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.	sorry if i had offended u.
1	So you believe if a kid threatens to shoot up the school it should be just ignored as children"s innocent mischief..........Tell that to the kids that died at Colombine..... emoticonXRolleyes	You know they arrested a teenaged boy, here in michigan, for making the suggestion of doing a school shooting.
1	Excuse me, I stand corrected. For 'pretend' please substitute 'wrongly believe'.	I am not "pretending" to beilieve you to be a materialit/darwinist.
0	agreed. god does exist in some form, whether you want to call god a supreme being or whatever, there is a greater power out there thats beyond our comprehension. in the meantime lets all just get along	if there was no god explain how we are here there has to be some sort of god out there its kind of obvious...
1	I guess I'd rather live among them, too, than have a hot poker shoved up my bottom.	You may call the Amish "stunted" and "misguided", but I would much prefer to live among them (in the absence of technology) than in some inner city ghetto.
0	Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other.	The poor shooter probably thought, quite innocently, that his fellow countrymen might be about to shoot him with their concealed carries, he shot them first, a perfectly reasonable response.
0	Not needed? It is evolution. The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene. The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations. It is by definition, evolution.	The ONLY reason is natural selection.
0	this statement isn't logical.It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or can't change them...or even that they apply to him. If a teacher says "no talking in the classroom" it doesn't apply to the teacher now does it.	Let's see who's going to be consistent about their beliefs.
1	i think your right big orn and that is what i was thinking... do you think your level of bitterness has something to do with quality of life? i guess the glass is half empty for those....	so it's a telling story...sometimes, know what i mean?
1	yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own.	you agreed with trebor pappy.....now you are back pedalling..re previous post
0	You mean, the perpetrator is convicted and the defender acquitted? Yes, that's the rule and not the exception. Notice here how no-one ended up dead, or even particularly seriously injured. Additionally the circumstances described are incredibly rare, that's why it makes the news.	When you threaten to rape and murder and entire family, and you're in less trouble than the person you threatened, that's not a sign of the country being safe or worth living in; especially when this is the rule and not the exception.
0	Regardless of the name change, the calendars are still keyed on the birth and death of Christ...and that will be so at least until the atheists are able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentalities.	actually, the more common usage would be CE.
0	No. We know that evolution happens. What would be a problem would be to find the processes that made evolution happen as such incredible rates. There isn't any evidence that it can happen that fast.	Nearly all informed evolutionists will admit that without billions of years their theory is dead.
1	Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence. You mean like Bill Ayers (sic) and his wife or Carl Rowen? Wait my bad they aren't from the right.	You needn't be far left to support reasonable gun regulation.What current firearm related issue would drive an "anti-gunner" to commit a terrorist act?Or are you just lumping anyone who supports gun control in with PETA and radical environmental groups?I'd be watching for the next murderous domestic terrorist to come from the ranks of those sporting teabags.
1	Yes, necessarily for YOUR genocidal rantings. But not for actual reality.	<snip>There is NECESSARILY no innocent Muslim.
1	You jsut don't get it. You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not. What part of that do you not understand. You say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. How cruel can you be	I agree it's not an 'academic exercise', but not for the same reason you think.I no more take 'pleasure and joy' from something like this than any other public act of due process, e.g.
1	what? naaah,... all we have to do is deny the suspects are 'persons' then we can do any emoticonxcensored thing we want to with them and there's no moral aspects to it at all,... just like abortion and (at one time) slavery. one thing that has always puzzled me,... 'how is it that enemy combatants and convicted murderous terrorists can come away with more rights and sympathy from the left than a prebirth little human child can?' (scratching head) emoticonxconfused how is it that a leftist can see more outcries for humanity in a whale, dolphin, spotted owl or field mouse than they do in an actual prebirth human child? one of the great mysteries of the modern world, i suppose.	like torturing suspects because the preznit says so?
1	How does this address your claim that the Second Amendment served as a defense against a tyrannical federal government? Are you moving the goalposts now?	I'm not sure what you're claiming is a contradiction.
0	Does any part of the theory of evolution give an accounting of how we transitioned from quadruped movements of the ape to biped?	No, there were never any Quadruped humans.
0	The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it.	Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad (or constitutional), or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad (or constitutional), it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban.
1	Then God should have used someone they trusted and respected to deliver that message. emoticonXRolleyes	Perhaps the answer to the prayer was to go to the doctor and these parents didn't listen.
1	How do they use "the empirical evidence prove it", when they do no research, and no evidence actually supports their "theory"?	Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture, they let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done.
0	And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation? I'd also like a link to verify what you say. Thank you. God Bless!	I have to ask: have you actually read what you just quoted?
1	Forgive me. A few minutes with Google ought to give enough info to refute what he said, so I didn't bother.	I didn't realize you could just summarily disregard a poster's source without providing any info to back this up.
0	take it up with who brought it up. who said the idea of it being 'scientific' is the criteria for a theory to be taught in schools?  schools have to have some degree of autonomy to have the curriculum they want without over-regulation. who sets the standard of what's 'scientific' or not?	but, if you accept that it is not a scientific theory, why should it be taught in a science class?
1	<sarcasm mode on> it's sexual assault because when she sobered up and realized what she'd done, the little darling couldn't possibly have been responsible for her own actions.  <sarcasm mode off>	if she brushes her teeth and does other things to suggest she's drunk rather than fully mentally incapacitated and then has sex, why is it sexual assault?
1	So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?	(I felt the holy spirit .. take your lithum kid).. )

0	Another cheap attempt at diversion on your part? Once again, EZ, I'm not taking your diversionary bait. Instead, I suggest that you give some serious consideration to the nature of your sources. Doing so will save you a lot of humiliation.	in a link he gave over at the USAT Creation / Evolution Forum:
1	Well, this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum, it is likely, he'd be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe'd actually be contributing to the pro-choice position...	What are you referring to here?
0	Actually, society hasn't said this. 5 judges, in very recent times, have. I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old. I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the "18 and over execution rule" in the eighth amendment.	We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.

0	'Most Biblical scholars'? If you mean they think the letters are forgeries and weren't at least dictated by Paul, then it's just not true that most Biblical scholars think that. I agree in terms of the idea that Paul in some cases had someone else actually put the words on paper and he told them what to write, but that's pretty irrelevant here, IMO.	Just interjecting...several of the letters attributed to Paul were not writen by his hand according to most biblical scholars.
0	But wouldn't the biochemical similarities speak for themselves? That is, does one have to believe that the two specimens (which share biochemical similarities) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics? The observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient (and more scientific?).	Quote:So it would make sense that a mold (which is a type of fungus) shares the same common ancestor that other fungi share, and would have a lot of biochemical similarities with them which it would not share with bacteria.
1	Why doesn't this apply to Soviet Russia - which had a population of similar size ? Presumably, your answer would be that the USSR was less "developed" than the US ?	.And of course the US will have more Nobel prizes; as one of the more populous developed countries there will naturally be a larger pool of humanity from which to pull.
1	oh yes, the flood that left no trace of ever occuring. gotta fear the threat of nothing! i'm so afraid of a flood that never happened!  as for sodom, well, i practice good hospitality. i don't know about you. you know, god isn't going to be happy when you keep limiting its power by calling it a 'he' all the time. god is limitless, it has no gender.	you may not believe it but morals wise this country is going to hell in a handbasket, and if the 'big guy in the sky' is looking down at things that are happening here he can not be happy...... judgment day might be on us sooner then we think..... you can scoff at that though......that is the same thing they did before the big flood and the destruction od sodom...........

0	I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, "And the truth shall set you free"!!!	Give to God what belongs to God.
0	Yes, you are missing something. How come age doesn't start at conception? How come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old.	But then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the US Census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage.

0	Almost?   Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.	The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population.
0	oh yeah everytime you downvote someone you lose points so if you don't have that many you go into the negative.	i didn't know your point score could go into the negatives.
1	Abortion is not immoral? End of story? Simone, are you trying to impose your own personal moral code upon me? Well I never....	Hmmm, I just think it is dead wrong to force your morals upon someone else and especially heinous when your morals are WRONG.Abortion is not immoral.
0	it can't always be cared by anyone. What if no one wants the baby or you can't get to a place where you can give the baby up (maybe snowed in for a week). Can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you.	And, of course, you totally miss the point.The point is that a 1-day-old infant can be cared for by ANYBODY!
1	Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns.	It has 'splintered' in the fact there are more than one way to interpret things.. and how strictly one follows the rituals.
1	Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.	Which leaves anyone believing that nonsense in the OP looking rather foolish Best rush out and buy an extra gun or two in case it might be true.
0	You are very right. We too will have to pay tax on the insurance for me. Not fair.	That being said, I still have to pay tax on my partner's health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union.So it has to be marriage.
1	are you a little bit retarded or something? don't get me wrong sleazyrider i love babies, they're delicious!	how many babies have you supported killing?
0	let me guess - you also believe that moses wrote the torah, wherein he describes his own death and burial? 'wild theory'? i suggest you do an internet search on the synoptic problem and the related two-source theory.  why do you demand that which you know cannot be produced? no, we don't have the q source, but we have evidence which points to a q source. likewise, we have a great deal of evidence which suggests that the torah had multiple authors.	these liberal theories of yours are only that - theories, with no historical, archeological, or traditional evidence to support them.
0	Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed.	the big news here has nothing to do with dinosaurs and chickens: it's that proteins were found in dinosaur bones after supposedly 68 million years.
1	Do you know how many Osama Bin Ladens we Killed???? emoticonXRolleyes	How many Einsteins or Edisons did we kill?
1	Actually, isn't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing? Creationists even have a magazine formally called "Ex Nihilo" (changed to "Creation" because creationists didn't know what it meant.)	What great faith you evilutionists have in nothingness!
0	i'm a little surprised by this. the polls i've seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage. i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem.	are not happy about this move.
0	There are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth. Some use 'science' to say that the world is flat. Granted that these beliefs aren't widely accepted, but then not all religions are widely accepted. By your reasoning or 'logic' you must ask yourself about whether you should rely on science when there are many different scientific theories.The Flat Earth News, at least back then, had a regular column, "One Hundred Proofs Earth is Not a Globe."(go to http://www.flat-earth.org/)Other theories taught as sciencephrenologyalchemyevolutioneugenicsneptunismTheories of the Aether Articles relating to the Emergence of Scientific Theories of the Cosmic Aether(http://www.mountainman.com.au/aether.html)What about 'metascience'?http://www.calresco.org/lucas/science.htmOr, sciences used to support political ends...What about Marxist Sciencehttp://www.marxists.org/archive/hald...philosophy.htmor Chaos Theory and Marxismhttp://www.marxist.com/science/chaostheory.htmlThere's Nazi Sciencehttp://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/naziscience.htmlNationalist Sciencehttp://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htmOr social ends...Scientific Racismhttp://www.press.uillinois.edu/f02/tucker.htmlMainstream scientists instead of using the word 'heretic' use the word 'pseudo-science' to categorise fringe beliefs.	so yes the existance of other religions can be seen as disproof for your god, becuas logic dictates that you must ask yourself why your god didint speak to people in asia or south america.
1	To bad you don't have the power to define the situation.	Or have you entirely abandoned that effort?Btw only you guys are calling it fine print, loophole, weasle hole, whatevas.
1	All sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you.	I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.
0	ok, great so far. we're getting some good predictions on both sides. i think this is going to be a lot of fun to look back at in time. keep it up. more topics... cap and trade. will strict controls be placed? what effects if so? iraq. will he pull out? what happens then? (with iraq or terror here or whatever) how much $$$ will he throw at the economic crisis? what will the outcome be? anything you all want to predict or comment on concerning the upcoming presidency will be appreciated. have fun!	the following is edited down to one point: social security is not strictly 'disability' insurance.
1	Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.	Everything that happend in the universe happens according to "laws."
1	If that's the case I wish someone would unplug me. I'm getting tired of this version of reality.	I cant prove he lived.. and you cant prove he didnt.I however could pull out this 2000 year old book, and the dead sea scrolls.. and say... well.. people have believed he did.. and wrote about it.And the level of detail is such that it would be difficult if not impossible for his existance to be a fable...except of course... we may all be living in a matrix computer program and all this stuff we see right now... maybe an illusion.. so..-Mosheh Thezion
0	While I'm not going to consider Dr. Tiller a pillar of society, I'm certainly not going to condone his murder.	I don't think you will find many reasonable people thinking it should be anything different.
1	Where do you get off saying that kind of tripe to somebody?  That kind of insane comment is typical of far left loons like you who lie for a living and don't have the common sense of a fence post.  And that goes for Jo Bennett too if he's agreeing with you.  Cretins.	as i said before just because you don’t realize it doesn’t mean that it is not influencing you to do what everyone else is doing.
1	i love when differing from someones opinion is 'weak'. such a convincing argument.	there is no need for you all (y'all) to feel as i do.
0	i think this is something everyone on here can get behind. at least i would hope so. saying that fred phelps is an embarrassment to this nation and my home state would be a gross understatement. sadly, i can't say i'm surprised by this, but i definitely don't think i would have ever predicted it. what he is doing is despicable. and what the patriot guard is doing is amazing. i like the sentiment involved in attempting to pass laws against protesting at funerals (although i don't know if they'll hold up in court), i only wish they had felt the same when he was protesting aids victims.	the church, westboro baptist church, is not affiliated with a larger denomination and is made up mostly of fred phelps' extended family members.

0	Thank God. I too hope it doesn't keep going back and forth. While I live across the river in Parkville, Missouri, I used to live in Overland Park Kansas and went to school there. I think they are generally pretty good public schools, it's just the state school board that keeps effing everything up when they get some christonazis on board.	Hopefully it won't continue to go in this back and forth forever.
1	Are we talking about the same Obama here? The same one, who's head of the DHS, told law enforcement to be on the lookout for anyone who disagreed with the government?	If Obama had his way, standing against the government would be the most patriotic thing someone could do.
0	Exactly. Most people would incorporate it, from childhood most often. Steeeeve can't seem to wrap his mind around that.	I suspect that a lot of people, if not most people, at least partially follow some version of "treat others as you would have yourself be treated".

1	absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years.	'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned.
1	Exactly my point! After four pages he finally gets it! Give him a hand! There's a brain in that head after all! But my point is, that unless you do disagree with the stats, your argument is irrelevant.   [QUOTE]What I have been saying for the last three pages is that your question is idiotic, as you're comparing things which are completely different in function. They are not analogous.	Let me say that again:I never said your stats were wrong.
1	yeah, like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will. you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them? i was going to say that you live in your own little world, but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen.  what? either try that again, or find someone who can translate. i kinda thought that the insecure, paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security. i don't need to carry a gun, i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me. i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security, and as such, want to carry a gun. there is a difference.	well, it seems that even the simplest of messages failed to penetrate some thick (sick) skulls: without guns you can not shoot and kill anybody.

Err, no correction necessary, I just felt like saying Enrapture.No the dooms-day will not be on the arrival of the asteroid, that has nothing to do with it, the dooms-day event will be a terrible event, even for the innocents, wrong on both accounts.

1	You still trying to push your propaganda film? Let me ask you something, why would the fetus try and avoid the forceps? An infant will cheerfully try and grip a knife that is about to end it's life.	Well there is bias on both sides of the issue.........I did look at the film from about 3 different sites and I don't think you can deny that baby is trying to avoid those forceps that want to take its life..........
0	can you support this moronic statement? the answer is obviously no. also, why should obama be less responsible for his own words on guns and religion than palin is for the words of her audience? the media will follow palin through the gates of hell and beyond to find something to demonize her. what lengths won't they take to attack republicans?	palin was giggling with joy when she saw how her supporters responded to her racist hints.
1	'define'? as if it's a definition? tell me, archie: precisely how ignorant of this topic are you? so you want me to give you the better part of what could amount to a semester-long advanced college course in a single post? do you really think that you'll understand curvature of space-time as induced by matter when you can't even understand the difference between a scientific theory and a drunken guess? do you really think i have any inclination of trying to tell you about the technicalities of relativity when you don't understand that light and gamma rays are the same thing? get real. you need to get your head out of your xxx before you'll be able to even hear me.	and if so, what effect does it have on the light or gasses that pass between them genius?
0	just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.	Reducing women to pretty quote that is hung in your kitchen doesn't mean squat out in here in the real world, and it doesn't indicate that you get it, let alone care.
1	Nice spin. Would you have preferred "the civilized world" instead? Or Western Civilization or Gay Western Civilization? Your preference? One case in 1959 isn't a pandemic.	It's disease vector into the north american contanent just so happened to have been via a gay man, yes,.. so it was in that population in north america that got hit the hardest.
0	The goal of anti-abortionist is clear. The job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters.	In turn, this might increase the chances of an abortion.
0	They need to keep their opinions to themselves and out of the law the effect gay peoples lives. I see nothing wrong with locking up those who incite hatred towards gay people just as we lock up people who shout fire in a crowded theatre.	[i][indent]"Canada has "hate" speech/crimes laws and regulations and Canadian Christians, along with other people of faith, are being vehemently persecuted for speaking out publicly against the acceptance and promotion of homosexuality within their own country.
1	psh if i had to f*&^ hillary i'd cheat too! i mean i'm gay but lord have mercy! lol... but getting back to the subject at hand. simone hun honestly just stop with the cook theories and whoever else even believes them. bush and dick had no idea of 9/11 we all didn't.  i find it a sad irony that we discover the warning signs after the incident... we're only human and we all make mistakes... oh and fyi we did not land on the moon.. simone told me it was made of cheese and that there were giant moon rats eating and eating until one day the moon will be gone... that's why there are holes in it. it's true!!! honestly!	do you think slick willie knew about any thing beside tail?

1	True they should have passed raincoats and knee boots to protect peoples clothes from the XXXX that the president was spewing out.	Now I certainly think that Cindy should have been simply removed rather than arrested, but whats done is done.
1	Absolutely. Because atheists are spiritually constipated and are too dumb to realize God and Christ are real.	Do you believe they (atheists) should not be allowed to display their message but the church should be allowed to display theirs?
1	what are you talking about?!?! the constitution was written in the late 1700's we have to go by thier meaning not a modern interpretation, this is most silly. as for your quote on adams i do not see how that even remotley applies to this discussion... care to expound?	john adams explained that women were not part of 'the people' because 'nature has made them fittest for domestic cares' and women were unfit for 'the great business of life, and the hardy enterprises of war, as well as the arduous cares of the state'.
0	So what? It's not like institutions in this country haven't been changed before, including the supposed intitution of marriage! Guess what? It's called progress, get used to it.	Gay marriage will change the institution.
0	These aren't the only two options available. The many philosophical views of the material world or ethics don't mean these two things don't exist.	This leads some into woolly New-Age-ist pick-and-mixing; others to conclude that the world's religions are all the product of a similar, purely mundane, process of cultural evolution, and that none actually reflects fundamental truths.
0	I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm asking if you'd think differently in that case, and you're not answering.	dreaming up imaginary what if situations doesnt prove anything,youve got nothing
0	Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.	This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart.
1	Well if you are Catholic you would should probably find him pretty credible.	http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...d=awia81URdshwWho the hell is he to say the love between my partner and I of 8 years is weak?!

0	It isn't offered to make that assertion at all. It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price.	It seems to me the position of the woman is rather different in the two scenarios!I'm not saying abortion is always morally acceptable, not by a longshot.
0	i'm not 100% sure what set of facts you are working from, but they are not the correct ones i assure you. way more jewish people were killed than died in the iraq war. when you add everyone killed in wwii iraq is not even a comparison. let me make it clear, i'm debating the lesser of two evils here, (speaking of the war, i'm not for the assassination of bush. you can't kill someone for being an idiot, if so kill everyone who elected him, not just him... which would be more people than wwii and iraq war combined by the way)... where was i? oh yeah, there's no comparison. it's an evil (though crazy) ass who caused millions upon millions to die, vs. spoiled governor's son way too dumb for his position listening to douchebags like dick.	killing bush, however, will save many iraqis and preserve the american economy and kill off a major terrorist.

(ps, wilted_laughter is irish i think. your post sort of implies you think him english. calling an irishman 'english' is a crime even more serious than calling someone a 'liberal' in the usa :p)	hyea- right - in england the speaker of the house isn't even allowed to speak... :p ... so-o-o?
1	No more hypocritical than somebody actively harping on me for citing the Huffington Post, but then HAVING NO negative comment for the RNC embracing NewsMax...But here's an idea.You probably wouldn't vote for me cause I cited Huffington Post, right?So logically, one should ALSO NOT VOTE for Republicans who embrace NewsMax, right???emoticonXDonnoNah. I don't expect that kind of consistency...	It takes a hypocrite to cite the huffington post and then complain about a news source.
0	Really? Show me that by quoting where the article says it.	Indeed, the article describes how the court's reasoning was even a surprise to the police officers' attorney because it was so out of line with what is expected of conduct during arrests.
1	which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie.	frank caliente doing his john madden imitation 'here's a guy who knows so much about so little he can judge the ethics of somebody who actually has ethics, while having no ethics of his own!
0	So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.	You might as well be citing yourself!Even one of the biggest advocates of the post-Dunblane handgun ban admitted that the ban was a huge failure, because even school children were able to get access to guns and kill their classmates.Don't you ever spread this lie again, we know that there's no ounce of truth to it!
0	As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity.	No, faith and reason are mutually exclusive.

1	Wow! ...... If your interpretation were correct, there would be a connection between his post and the USSR! But it's not, and there isn't.	Wow, so if you are correct, the USSR must be a perfect utopia to live in now!
0	So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?	I'm glad you made the same correlation I did.
0	Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a "link," whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!	It was an interesting creature, but simply having features present from two different forms (bird and dinosaur) doesn't mean it is a link?

0	Nope. Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step, making entirely new genes. Often, this is disastrous, but sometimes, a useful new enzyme results.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.	That is what one would expect to find.
0	Mach, your ability to make the wrong argument on the wrong post continues. I ask a question of this person, you reply not to them, but to me, and with ad hominem, and a 'just-so' statement.	Ironic, since your "Out of China" post was basically the same as this post.You even claim you had no debate point, you were just posting "information".
0	That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists. And that is what I was getting at originaly. Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid.	The agnostic position is obviously tentative, however even though the atheist does not explicitly state his position is tentative, you will be hard pressed to find an atheist who states "there is absolutely, positively, with out a doubt, no god at all".
0	Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.	There is no reason why it should remain illegal.I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed.

0	this is getting mighty old trebor.  i'll take that last post as a tacit admission that you had, indeed, invented budge as a source. the question then becomes, where did you get these ideas from first time around, and why aren't you sharing them with us? why did you feel compelled to fib? this photo brings up a bunch of other questions. on what website did you just find that picture? how and why are you interpreting it as it you are?	or are we to accept this as evidence just because you posted it in response to arts post?
0	That is what supersport is hoping to do... However, assuming that you are correct in your interpretation, he has no chance of doing it so well.	Pointing out that an XXX is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless.
0	that's an interesting observation. by what means are you reasonably sure? do you think the other religions have the same take on it as you do? i used to think the same: if there is only one god, then they had to be worshipping the same, just giving him different names. then i was introduced to matt.7. clearly god only wants identifying (ex.6:3, 15:3 etc.) and worshipping one way, therefore all other religions have to be wrong. just a thought.	even if we just take the abrahamic religions we're still looking at about 2/3 of the world's population.
1	i love how you claim that the teabag party is not affiliated with the republicans, who are they going to vote with ?.. the democrats?.. they may not claim to be republicans but last i checked we only have two major parties representing us in the house and senate, with maybe one or two independents.the tea bag party isn't big enough to control anything without republicans so enlighten me, who are they going to vote with to destroy what obama has accomplished so far?...	your sides anti american sentiments are why this country is spiraling into a moral and fiscal decline that we may be too late to salvage for the next generation.

One of my biggest regrests is that I never made it to Olduvai Gorge. It would have been interesting to pay a visit to the ancestral homeland!

0	wikipedia is really quite amazing actually. you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it. that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors. but, there are millions of contributors. each going over and correcting information supplied by others. in my mind (given the current number of users) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information.	are you telling me that tiktaalik fossils, archeopteryx fossils and platypus don't exist, and that using wikipedia is somehow misleading in this sense?
1	NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!	Should gun registration be mandatory ?

1	got anything more than your opinion that proves scientifically that the athletes will be completely safe and breathing pristine air with the factories shut down 2 weeks before the games start, and only half the cars taken off the road each day? i mean, it took a decade or more before the la basin declared victory over the dangerous pollutants that prevented asthmatics from going outside on certain days after we attacked the same problem back in the 70s. so don't you think it's a tad naive to think everything will be honky dory after 2 short weeks with these limited actions? and don't forget the neighbors the link mentions and their unending pollutants that will continue to come in on those same winds.	your same article says that 'meteorologists say china must shut them down a few weeks before'.

0	i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human. then why do we stop at a fertilized egg? if you mean potential, is supposed to become, or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being. if we say based on results then killing is killing. the reasons are irrelevant, there is no difference between abortion, capital punishment or self defense.  yes these are extreme, but its where your position leads. at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far, but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another.	look, i lost my response; i'm not going to retype it because in hindsight i was just repeating the same thing: you and i both know the issue is the morality of the act, choice is meaningless because all the law is, is the use of force to prevent (or prevent further) immoral choices.

0	And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy, the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller. Doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold.	If you're small then you can have a smaller brain,this contradicts evolutionists' position.
1	You're right, why not simply kill these people in the shortest amount of time possible. I got it! We can advertise each killing (hanging, rock slaying, Guillotine, etc.) weeks in advance, kinda like moves, and show it on pay-per-view. You can buy tickets to watch the show live as well. I mean c'mon, if we're going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome, cost efficient, and swift method possible. Right? That is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago.   Honestly, how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders. In regards to the death penalty debate, it falls along a continuum between morality and scientific reasoning.	but short of the death sentance, then yes, life without parole should be hard and no fun whatsoever, and i mean ever.
1	I agree, it is pure genius...especially how it has infiltrated politics and governments. emoticonXBanghead	Its pretty clear that the attributes of God were made up along the way over the course of history, for different motivations from explaining disasters and natural phenomenon, to comforting greiving loved ones, to controlling the masses and justifying the whims of the rulers.

1	wrong again daewoo; but at least you are painfully consistent. i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth. but then, who would ever accuse you of getting anything right? once again, the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been, more so than even carter.  i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point.  it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise.  so were you born this clueless, or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless?	so, in one thread you are whining because he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, but in this thread you are gloating because the legislation he suggested to fix that got shot down?

0	How do you know there isn't a tiger in the bathroom? You feel very strongly and have over-whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom? (You live in an urban area, there are no zoos, you don't hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle, and the water is going) But you cannot prove a negative. Which is also why you won't be able to prove that creationism is wrong, and why we can't prove evolution is wrong. The focus must be on proving one right. How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought.	Certainly, if I said "there isn't a tiger in my bathroom", I wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see.

1	apparently you need to read up on up-to-date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics. that's right, and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well. so? i guess you'd also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it's born too, with that reasoning. there are many, many women in the pro-life movement. my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am. (trust me, you don't want to be in a room with her after you've killed a baby!) if you think this is a men versus women issue, you are sadly mistaken.	it is selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life.
0	Your statment is like saying we evented 2+2= 4. We did not envent it, it aways existed. Same with logic, its a concept that exists apart from the meterial universe. But in the atheists worldview, only the meterial universe exists.	Guess what, they weren't Christians.
1	Oh, really?   Translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to.	The fact that freedom of speech is still valid has nothing to do with this - the constitution doesn't rise and fall as one, or the concept of 'amendments' would not exist.
0	That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X.	In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.
0	You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons?How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others. Before you respons think about it. Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment? Lots of cannons? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly.	Doesn't mean it will stand up in court.The first portion, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State," is a qualifier to what follows "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
1	wow, i don't understand how this keeps happening. i'll try to switch mice.	so you are saying we should try and forget about it?
0	Just how do you suppose the government seeking permision would work in reality? And what exactly are you afraid of? It seems odd when people advocate blind trust for Joe Civilian, but then think that the government shouldn't be allowed to be armed. I think there must be a balance in trust given both ways.	Afterwards they can just turn them in and go back to being in their proper place.
0	What's "cumulative selection?" Do you mean a series of mutations with small but beneficial influence that occur over the period of thousands or millions of years? Just how do you propose to observe such mutations? In fact, we can observe such mutations by comparing the genomes of related species.	...yet the types of mutations that are required for cumulative selection have never been observed.
1	Doesn't surprise me lets all jump ship and put our heads in the sand... Even more of a reason I should run for public office :p	The reason simones threads turn to Yobama is because she is attacking Rick Warren as if he is responsible for anything the Ugandan Government does.
1	You do that, and be sure to use it when I repeatedly and ignorantly claim that the unborn are parasites while refusing to actually prove it as ingus has done here.

0	Actually, if you count the Kinsey 4,5, and 6's you get 18%. It's 10% for the 5s and 6s. That'd be the people that prefer the same sex over opposite for the most part. 2,3,and 4 would be those who are bi and lean slightly one way or the other. 0 and 1 are people who pretty much always choose opposite sex over same. 0 and 6 are very rare though. Anyway, 10% of people are a 5 or 6. About 3% are a full 6.Could Jesus have been asexual? In certain philosophies asexuality is considered a sign of enlightenment. For instance, after becoming enlightened, the Buddha rejected sexual desires.	Nice try, but the target is 8' to the right.
0	well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer.	the only reason that it will be a mac is because of the information that is still inside of the computer that should be removed if you want to take the whole brain.

0	Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? Where do they get that power Constitutionally? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally. I think that marriage is a church issue. Let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. But leave marriage to the churches.	Marriage has become a state institution as much as a religious one, and I see no practical way to undo that at this point.
0	The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life.	But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry.
1	'blah blah blah'? look, you weighed in here on what i said, making an issue of whether it was internal, empatically making a point that it was action. as i said, i'm basically agreeing with you on the whole thing here about there needing to be equality in this situation, so i don't know why you're being so eager to find something to disagree over here.	you may find that some people find that preference a reason to question your commitment to gay rights.
1	I already have, hence the explanation I provided. If you challenge me to show you an error then I will. Did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if I could convince you it wasn't? When you post your evidence it usually has holes in it, not always but the truth is funny that way. It is very difficult sometimes to cover it up.And stay away from those shrimp, eagles, gays and snowmenThey are all abominations.	I'm not busting my butt for a certified Christ-denier who never admits anything when information is provided.
0	That and VOR keeps flip flopping on his positions and he refuses to clarify his contridictions.	Well you never know cause your pro life and for the death penalty.
1	WOW and the republicans would never do anything like that now would they.......They would never impeach a president over a BJ now would they?	With an election looming, the Dems will carry this beyond the limit of sensible investigation.
1	agreed, and they are really grasping at straws now. i'm surprised that anyone still takes kennedy seriously. emoticonxrolleyes	the democrats are going to do anything they can to bring down the gop..this is just another 'thing' to bring up to show how 'stupid' america is for putting them in power.
0	Well said.   With this religion, the gap is very wide between the "average guy" and "authority", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government.	But evolutionists are just as religious as Christians: they have their own unseen miracles – (random mutations)….their own clergy (scientists)…their own Bible (The Origin of Species)....and their own god (Natural Selection).
0	So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. You just want it used judiciously? Same here. Where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously.	Same with the others, if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine.
0	:d i love how no matter what we're talking about on createdebate, politics, and usually fox news, inevitably comes up. haha.	people undergo mass hysteria much to easy, which is one reason why i don't like the news, especially fox news.

0	How does this have anything to do with marriage? Reproduction occurs outside of marriage and has done so long before man became civilized.   Permitting only gay marriages won't decrease numbers. Increased family planning and birth control will.	One of the fundamental purpose of the union of a man and a woman is to create progeny.
1	Unfortunately for you, that is not shown, the evidence points in one direction, and one direction only. That of evolution and to the fact that the flood never happened.

0	how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?	i can't tell that since you ripped my answer out of its context.
0	To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more "preposterous".	To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
0	Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?Genesis says that all creatures were specially created. It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.Statis is the norm not the exception.One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?	If you think evolution cannot explain any change then why pick the avian lung in particular?
1	Quite amusing that you refer to westerners as Gringos. The last time I heard that was in a film about Pancho villa!	whatever 'rubber' was being exported probably ceased to be exported because of ravages of war during and after.Did you see any spike in the price of tyres, sorry 'tires' in the good old USA because of the Vietnam war ?natural rubber by the way is used mostly in big huge tyres not the size used in automobiles.Iraq was invaded to satisfy greed and ideology.
0	I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard.	The question here is wether or not you think hunting is a valid reason for gun ownership.
0	I have posted responses to Demon38's earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light.	If we are to give Christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidates, can you HONESTLY tell me that creationsim is the best answer?

1	according to what you mentioned previously, you violated the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and came out of the closet, disrupting your unit. real classy, jazy. your gay sex sin took preference over honorable service. but then that's your idol, so i'm not surprised.	i served in the united states navy from june 2006 to august 2008 and yet you still crucify me and others just like me because your religion and bitterness toward others has consumed you....
0	How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by "less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.	If we try to weed out the irresponsible ones, the poorer and less fortunate ones will get punished.
0	i'm very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees.	it sounds like at least some religious organizations recognize the impact of their not paying taxes upon others, and take the responsible route to ensure that they as employers do right by their employees (e.g.

0	i'm surprised that some people still aren't aware of what the chinese have done to upgrade their country. sure, certain areas like the financial sector are still lagging (which is why they won't float the yuan just yet), but when it comes to industry and infrastructure they're done a most admirable job. does anybody here also think it's kinda funny that a communist country is beating the us at their own game (i.e. capitalism)?	what we do manufacture is so out of line with labor/compliance costs to be totally uncompetitive even if the chinese doubled their prices.

0	there is plenty of evidence on what kind of marriage the clintons have. i am not making this up out of whole cloth, i am referring to the jr. senator's own words in her memoir 'living history': hillary rodham clinton felt 'dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged' when she learned of the affair and said that she could 'hardly breathe' when she learned the rumors of the affair were true. 'gulping for air, i started crying and yelling at him: 'what do you mean? why did you lie to me?' mrs clinton writes.  doesn't sound like such a swingin good time ey what? but don't take my word for it, go down to the library and read pg 502.  i stand by my previous thesis.	yet you have no idea what kind of marriage bill and hillary have.

1	Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics. Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number. I am sure that IRS, GOD, and Hovind can work it all out.	The big bang theory may not be the last word from science on cosmology, by I can't see a no-good, talentless hack like Hovind, or any other professional Creationist crank, providing us with any insights into it.

0	Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?	If a pregnant woman was denied Vitamin C - well, it hardly bears thinking about, but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it, too, was denied Vitamin C.Now, if the baby was born with a functional Vitamin C synthesising gene, that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes.

That is part of what we are debating in the abortion debate.However, unlike the term person or the ideas about when rights begin, the term genocide is NOT a matter of opinion and it DOES have a very specific DEFINITIVE meaning, as defined in the definitions posted over the last few pages.

0	Actually, that's not true. While all of the sciences actually support one another, one can be a chemist and not accept evolution. One can even do good science without accepting evolution, but it is difficult. For example, cosmology, astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe. That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution.	If somebody is not an evolutionist to you he/she is not "really" ascientist is he?
0	okay, my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion; but, here is my opinion anyway. one reason there are so many crimes against women, or crimes in general, is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time. how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses. i don't know what the answer is --but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes, especially sex crimes.	i have had to really change my point of view of how people (male and female) look at life lately, greg.

You should see some of the other "books" he has at his site as well.Well, now we know that Muslim creationists are even nuttier than Christian creationists, but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo-science of creationism (Read: Religious beliefs). ;)	I read the first chapter, here's some good excerpts.It's helpful if one understands evolution before one attempts to debunk it.That's just a blatant lie.
0	And here we have a leading YEC showing how he starts with his preexisting religious position and is not about to change it, no matter what the scientific evidences show.

0	I think perhaps you're confused.1. I know of no meaningful definion of the term "god' as it pertains to reality.2.

1	I think it would be best for neither one to have a gun, as there would be no chance of me getting hurt. After all, I could beat up a guy armed with a plastic fork. However, if the hijacker has a gun, I'd like someone (not me, I'm half blind in each eye, I'd probably hit a passanger or something) to have a gun.	Or would otherwise it result in a duel with plastic forks and the purple thing left over from lunch?Trouble is this question leads to the next one- would you prefer to possibly have a passanger with a gun, a the hijacker almost certainly with one.

0	Well said. Most Americans favor more gun control, but unfortunately this majority of Americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue. This is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control. There probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but I'm not sure how much this will change things.	The reason the dems wimp out is because the gun nuts votes are likely to be swayed by a candidate's position on gun control, whereas non gun nuts, while having an opinion, are most likely concerned about other issues.

0	To you, it may be an incorrect statement. But if it is, you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote. Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference. Injustice is still practiced there, and not even some abortion doctors realize it.	Viability seems to be the topic that gets little mention here.
0	That is not quite what the 'mitochondrial Eve' hypothesis posits.Science. 1995 Dec 22;270(5244):1930-6. The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the "mitochondrial Eve" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies.	Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial "Eve", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.

0	But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on.	Fire and tool use means that having a big brain becomes less of a disadvantage and more of an advantage now that you can feed it yea but you have to have the brains to build a fire before it becomes an advantage.

You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.   And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow.	in great britain the police have been arresting children for playing with toy guns.

1	uh. no. that isn't what he said. why do you misrepresent what he said? why are you lying so much? every time you lie like that, jesus kills a kitten.	you are correct it is you that is the imbecile..i apologiseemoticonxclown i know your position exactly..head up backside and xxxx in your eyes..thats why you cant read properly...christianphobeemoticonxchicken
0	The man seemed have a thing about prostitutes. I believe he felt it was his God-given destiny to punish them.Cybererratus is a very interesting persona. He manifests a number of very interesting character traits. I don't believe that he likes women very much. In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling.	Later in a statement Ridgway said that murdering young women was his "career".
1	What case? You don't have a case, or a leg to stand on! emoticonXRolleyes	Not a demand, a request.I rest my case.
0	did prohibition of alcohol do any good? nope, just made the criminals all the more powerful. did prohibition of drugs do any good? nope, just made the criminal all the more powerful. will prohibition of legal firearms do any good? not a chance in hell. banning legal ownership has never, ever, ever done anything toward ending the illegal use of something. never has, never will. it's absolutely impossible and just shows far for withdrawn people are from the real world in their thinking.	watch your mouth or your time here will shortly come to an end.
1	<flush>  Just come up with something that discredits the resurrection, if you think you can. Should be easy for you Einsteins, shouldn't it?  But in two years I haven't seen it yet. Not from you or anybody else.  Where's the beef?	if you want to post a rant about ``dose evul librals``, do it on the proper forum, and i`ll ignore it there as well.
0	So what is your point? Are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views? Science proceeds by challenges and contradictions. Contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance. In religion, it is without question, a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth. Which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth?	Sounds contradictory to me!
0	Well then it sounds like you don't even know what a SM is seeing as the 3rd one is the main one that people like you bring up when debating this isse.	The first one is moderately valid... the rest are straw men.
0	He made a post suggesting you were a troll, it has been removed it seems. Anyway, glad to help.	And I've never been really certain of what a troll is.
0	It's not a literal account unless you interpret it that way.	If you reject the literal account of the Creation in Genesis, you are saying that God is a liar!
0	winston dearie you really shouldn't make such general accusations, that can get you into trouble. point them out if you can. the shooting in norway, columbine, virginia tech, the tulsa shootings and the tuscon assassination attempt weren't carried out by people a normal person could consider decent and respectable in nature and they were all massacres. you might kill somebody too. you might kill a lot of somebodies for no reason. should you be legislated against and restrained?	one day doc may start shooting (he is already metaphorically sending simone to the ovens, which shows what a sicko he is) , who knows ?
0	i love when she reaches for that after wards; its like a hotel bed with 'magic fingers'. shakes the whole bed to help me get to sleep.	when men are done and promptly roll over and fall asleep..., that monstrosity is what women reach for ;)
0	You say that alot but discussion is about taking other people seriously.	Second, your assertion that we should stop menopause is also patently absurd!
0	I'm not moving the goal posts, this is just your attempt at intellectual dishonesty. Heller was about an individual right protected in the Constitution, Dred Scott wasn't. Therefore these two cases aren't comparable anymore than cotton candy and scrap metal.	My point was that the Supreme Court has been wrong before so assuming that the Supreme Court is always correct about an issue is unjustified.
1	Aaahhh, so just not accomplishing our goals and going home is not defeat, there has to be paperwork for it to be a defeat. Gotcha.	Choosing defeat would be surrender.
1	Because their reasoning is obviously on the same level as their reading comprehension level.	Well, as we can see from other recent posts, your reading comprehension is below high school level.I don't get it.
0	This is not true. Rather, when there is conflict between one's sanctity of life vs another's quality of life, the sanctity of life must win.	In affirming the absolute sanctity of life, we deny the sanctity of particular lives by putting them at the disposal of others - in the case of abortion, affirming the absolute sanctity of the baby's life involuntarily subordinates the mother to the child.
1	Thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like KFC to me.	Because if it's a chicken egg, and if it's allowed to incubate to term, it sure isn't going to be a crow when it hatches.
0	I think hip hop and the arts are reflections of society. It is good to bring these issues to light, if only so that those who wouldn't normally be aware of them are enlightened.	Ludacris and many others in the hip hop scene disrespect women with their lyrics and videos.
1	he screamed and insulted and threw his literature at the vice president of pride. and you once again snipet and reword my posts by taking them out of context to serve your own irrational and bigoted thought process. oh and dont accuse your community? what are you some holy leader? get off of your self rightous high horse and get a clue! and how is my community rising above your 'communities' bigotry and and slander? by having pride movements like these and standing up for ourselves.	don't you dare ever accuse my community of being intolerant or bigoted until your community rises above it.
1	be homophobic... like the naacp? oh wait, they're left wing. call for war... like the democrats for vietnam? oh wait, they're left wing. be racist... like claim that minorities can't help themselves? oh wait, that's also left wing. sir... you've engaged in stereotyping... that makes you... hmm.	i place rw extremos higher than lw ones because they are more likely to call for war, be racist and be homophobic.
1	What's the matter? Can't anybody in KC afford to have 2 cars? emoticonXWow	I voted No, cars are for transportation only, only because it was the only "no" option.
0	well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice.	there are gays that go to my gym, am i being homophobic if i purposely avoid showering with him?
0	I think the energy( essence of the human life) always was	for instance, can life be defined as energy?if so, then birth becomes as much of an enigma as death; is energy created too?
0	Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it.	The key difference is that these countries do a much better job than we do of keeping guns out of the wrong hands.
0	you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india.	in particular, the government may not take any action whos primary effect is to advance or endorse religion and 'the constitution forbids not only state practices that 'aid one religion...or prefer one religion over another,' but also those practices that 'aid all religions' and thus endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion'.
0	They can "marry" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.	So what rational reason would there be to deny them the right to marry the person they love?
0	Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram. I think that you'll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much.	Why, if one wants to have an abortion, should one be FORCED to view a sonogram?
1	Yeah, but now the special interests won't have access to congress' deep pockets emoticonXRolleyes (hopefully)	Personally, I'd like to see Congress take an extended vacation and only work part-time as our forefathers envisioned.
1	Might as well attribute intelligence to your thermostat as rape seed plants.	A chemical reaction in response to an environmental change in condition is not a 'mind'.
0	Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.	to become the nations next biggest idiot?
1	This should be in the science section, not the CvE section. Don't give SS any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology.	I've always been fascinated with the big bang, and we may finally start to understand much more about it and how it happened.Thoughts?
0	Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates. It's my personal favourite - but what do you think?	This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist.
0	They do not. They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible. Feathers also offer increased protection from attack. They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers. They absorb and spread impact quite well.Feathers don't itch and they don't rustle in the bush.Do you have an answers that aren't examples of shallow thinking?	They offer reduced protection.
1	Unriggable, your statement should read the so-called "pro-life" since they are anything but.	Pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.Or am I missing something?
0	we are not talking about genesis as a story are we? we are talking about bilbical creation. you really are thick arent you? i know there are religious people, deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread. undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it. certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved. the horse evolution thread was fine...you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. now show exactly how life originated and you're home and dry.	you see, this is talking about 'biblical creation'... you know, taking genesis literally, and all that type of nonsense.
0	dear thetruth, i have posted it as a serious topic. and of course it is meant to get people talking, thinking and arguing. if you were watching/listening to the trump press conference that obama brink into the middle of (beceause he was getting slaughtered), you would take this seriously. btw, on may 23rd (the day after he finisheds the last apprentice show), we can expect some announcement! what it will be i don't know, but i bet it will be trump confirming he will run for president. andy	if you post this for fun, i understand but if you post this as a serious topic, then this is stupid.
0	And evolution is exhausted. It can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more.	True, but it does make evolution a known factor, and the scientific method requires that one prioritise exhausting the explicative power of known factors before inventing new ones.
0	Actually, I meant the behaviour refered to in her post was interesting.	As Mr. Jack said, interesting.
0	i'm surprised homeland security can't have gun's in dc banned. it's a federal designation, is it not?	wonder when d.c. is going to run out of money trying to defend the indefensible??
1	It probably was a bunny suit that he was supposed to wear. I guess he changed his mind, once again, and decided to wear this suit.	could a picture of kerry in a bunny suit (even if it was a real bunny suit) really sway voters?
0	But the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself. Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying'God must exist, because God is good and would not allow a world without God'.	It has gotten us far and will continue to (as long as we don't destroy ourselves in misusing that knowledge).
0	what do you find disrespectful about it? maybe it is 'disrespectful' but i sometimes that's not necessarily so bad. i don't think it rises to the level of being offensive.	you don't actually think that anyone who supports gay rights in any way could find that piece anything but disrespectful, do you?
0	i totally agree. you never know what you might pick up. but he likes to eat hey? that's weird. but to each his own. i like to eat more normal food myself. but if you explore certain sides of someones personality, do you really learn anything? how do you know you just don't watch and then five minutest after you explore the personality, you forgot everything about that person. i mean, i don't know, but i have some trouble picking up on personalities right away of people i meet. has anyone ever tried spilling tuna on the floor on purpose? i'm just wondering because that would be weird.	i guess its ok to explore certain sides of your personality, and its always good to get out and meet new people and try new things.
1	ROFL you don't even believe that given the democrat party's known escapades. I do hope you haven't stroked out due to the Brown victory. Let the games begin!	Brown's "lovely" supporters are the antithesis of civilization:Brown supporters trying to suppress vote by bullying - The Boston GlobeI don't know about you, but I don't care to associate with people like that.A childish, barbaric level of existence.
1	So they haven't gone into bankruptsy yet? I guess the illegal loans are helping after all. emoticonXRolleyes	I just heard about it on Air America.
1	Just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.	those kind of websites are like porn to gun nutsbut getting big gun wont compensate for being born with a small one
0	Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results.	Indeed, for several decades, molecular evolutionists have relied on an evolutionary view that abandons the Darwinian presumption of abundant pre-existing variation, assuming instead that the rate of evolution depends directly on the rate of introduction of new alleles by mutation.
1	No, they don't. Creationists do. "Why haven't all animals turned into humans?"	Evolutionists may talk of actual selection as if it had a mind of its own and does the work of evolution on purpose
0	You could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out.	-If you say you don't want the unborn to "live off you" anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now.-You have decided the stranger must go, however, you don't have a right to kill him right there as you didn't give him any reasonable time to leave.
1	Pure conjecture on your part. As a father of three, I have as much vested interest in my kids as my wife has. To suggest otherwise is BS. But, maybe you don't understand that because you haven't walked a mile in a father's shoes. emoticonXRolleyes	Of course men can, do, and should have opinions and feelings about abortion, but to say that your interest is equal to that as a woman is silly.
1	The Fact that you believe there is some sort of salvation in Jebus proves you are the dumb one.. You should stop rejecting reality ....	Dawkins is probably in Hell right now wishing he wasn't so dumb in rejecting Christ's salvation.
1	This just goes to prove that these nasty gays are maliciously infiltrating the military far more than we suspected (anyone would think they want to defend the country or something). But no, they just want to infect them with nasty squiggly crawly things. EEeew!! Look the SEALS must be a bunch of raving deviants. Quick, club the lot of them before this thing spreads.emoticonXRolleyes   Er . . . *puts down burning cross and slinks into shadow*	There have been significant outbreaks in the SEAL training school in San Diego, as well as the Marine Recruit Training Depot, but this has not made the news.

1	Well it depends he could always be a sperm donor or make some Lesbian couple happy :)	What will your sperm be doing besides causing stains?
1	Hey Dane, you're real good at calling people ignorant, sanctimoniously declaring everything they say as false, blatantly false, or falsehoods. But would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts arguments with anything more than insults? Like some actual facts for example?	If your argument is based on outright falsehoods like you just did, then the output will be false as well.
0	how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act? i don't see what you're getting at.	during the clinton administration, reno's justice department and tennet's cia treated terrorism as a criminal act, which it is not.

0	I think your idea has merit. However, before I would fully endorse it, I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law.	The thing is, though, that if marriage is privatized people can have freedom without "redefining the standard."
1	Oh my!!!!! Salon.com and Huffington Post think the guy was at fault! Get out!	To the point of my previous post...This round-table discussion (with clips) is from today's "Hardball with Chris Matthews":Hardball with Chris Matthews

0	But the fact remains that guns are, by design, weapons.	Some people do also get a pleasureable effect from shooting guns and using them for such purposes as hunting and target practice.
1	So, some parts of the Bible are erroneous oral history after all! What a refreshing admission.	...and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah, in Oral history, so it would differ slightly, but that's becaue of man's error, not God's.
0	But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the "logical" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and "make sense" to more than one person, these specific "explanations" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.	Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith.
1	yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?	while you see the need to not only debate him on points, then post an expose about your ideas of his capability, i'm still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology.
1	Evidence? We're talking religion here. Religion. If there were evidence, then it would be science.	Is that a likely possiblity though?
1	You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:Question: Was Stalin a communist ?Answer: That's what he said he was.Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.	So Stalin didn't actually practice Communism (not that anyone has), but really just used bits and pieces to further his rule and such ideology is not communism but Stalinism.
1	pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ? your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.My advice to you ?keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.	My age is irrelevant to the fact that I simply know more than you can comprehend.
1	What, pray, is a real answer? Because, you know, if it is anything like a corrcect answer you are doing a rather poor job of it, mate.	The Creation Museum, like Creation magazine, the radio program Answers … with Ken Ham, and the other outreaches of Answers in Genesis, is dedicated to giving people real answers about the scientific, religious, philosophical and ethical debates of our day.
1	archie, it's already 'cleared up' that you're a liar. you claimed to know what he was about. you claimed it was a 'secular site that's dedicated to exposing the homosexual, extreme left, communist and anarchist agenda'. but he's not really interested in 'homosexuality' at all. and i find you're 'couldn't find it' to be incredibly absurd. it's on the web-page where he talks about the event in the first place. if you actually start clicking to see the pics and his comments, it's right there! i'm not linking to pornographic material on this web-site. the header of that web-page reads:  'up your alley fair san francisco, july 27, 2008 part 1' i am incredibly amused that you repeatedly lie all over the place on this web-site, but then you press others for proof.	as i said above, would you care to link to the description section where it say's this, because i couldn't find it.
1	I won't waste my time with trolls here. Do you have anything useful to say?	What conceivable connection could that sentence have with what went before --- except, possibly, to agree with me!-
0	BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry. Any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed.	It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.
0	Well let's deal with one thing at a time. The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. The study didn't conclude that it was just a "curious relationship in the numbers." Go back to that thread and read the study. If you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. You can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.	From my memory your medical references both showed the trend you state, but they were also limited in geography and sample (two cities), and provided no casue and effect, merely a curious relationship in the numbers.
1	what other forest? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world, and it would be what, the size on central park?	Like I said in #2, most of the earth's oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and we still have al the other forest.
1	Numbers don't lie, unless they come out of the mouth of a Politican.	Politicians love to include SS in their numbers to cloud the looting of that trust for general fund purposes and take some of the visual impact out of the size of military numbers.

0	are you saying you only have a hard time having compassion for the gay victims of sexually transmitted illness? if, so that just shows your anti-gay prejudice. what difference does that make? everyone who has aids is a victim. in some communities and in other countries, the majority who have it are straight. against the victims from the largest social group of victims in each jurisdiction? this is nothing more than prejudice and destructive political agenda.  i would hope there are other, better, human instincts inside of you.	i am sorry but i have a hard time having compassion for gays thay engage in anal intercourse and fail to use protection........that is how most cases of aids are passed in this country.... that is just me though..........
0	You have any examples of that? Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is.	"Boys and girls as young as 10", the story says.They threw "rocks and eggs" at her house.They don't kill you for that in England, Texas maybe.
1	so you are into pommy bashing now? mae honey, is there anybody you don't like? emoticonXRolleyes	I believe you said this a few days ago.Today it was revealed that the man the British police shot and killed on the subway because he did not stop as requested was a Brazilian who had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks in London.Spoke too soon ?
0	if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. based on results paul had more influence. how can you simply ignore the obvious? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it's unwillingness to concede that sometimes it's wrong. how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn't flat.  instead they either ignore the issue, bury it through violence or intimidation, or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right.	peter was obviously there are more writings of peter apart from the gospel of mark and 1 & 2 peter you find in the bible.... you will discover it is not only the bible that the church use for their deposit of faith but a number of other writings regarded as sacred tradition.
1	How do you KNOW Bush let's Cheney run the government..oh yeah, that's right, CNN/CBS told you. So you will knock one of the greatest minds this country has because he has a bad heart and can't stand for long periods of time? What a goober, so I guess Stephen Hawking should die too, huh?	I truly wonder what will happen if his ticker gives out.
0	Well let's put it this way. I really like playing baseball. So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they're in a position where it will threaten their life. Since it's such a wonderful thing no one should have any problem with a law passed, right?	I'm wondering why pro-choice people often portray pregnancy as a horrible thing in their arguments.
0	do you have any evidence of this that doean't come from a biased christian website? so here is where you are saying nanny, nannie, poo,poo my straight realtionship is better than your gay relationship. how? some big claims, can you provide some substance to them, in other words can you back this up with some data? that doesn't come from some christian baised study.	it would convey the false message that whatever private sexual relationships adults choose deserve the same legal treatment as traditional marriages.
0	And what would make them separate species? How about wolves and dogs, separate species? How about Great Danes and Chihuahuas? They cannot interbreed under any circumstances (even artificially - the fetus isn't viable).	Clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed, such as poodles and great danes, but they remain members of the same species.
0	Your stats aren't broken down into meaningful groups, so nothing is learned WRT Muslims.	Hmm - the stats say Western Europe has the lowest incidence of abortion.http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_IAW.html
0	The US is still the closest thing to a pure capitalist country in the world. But you are correct, our system is not a pure capitalist one. We have reminants of all types of systems including socialism. In the modern world I don't think a society as large as the US is could be run under just one pure system.	Socialism, communism and capitalism aren't the only choices for how to organize an economy.Also, the US at present is neither "pure capitalist" nor socialist.
0	I think a more telling question would be, why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe? It seems completely idiotic to me.   Smiley	i would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime, when other methods (better locks, alarms, non-lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers) can be effective.
1	Abstinence until heterosexual marriage isn't encouraging heterosexual marriage?  I've never heard of an abstinence-until-domestic-partnership program. Perhaps you could point us to an inclusive abstinence-only program somewhere.  Perhaps not....	regardless, there's no way anyone can argue that abstinence programs are about 'straight pride' or somehow about being straight, which was the context of the discussion when these examples came up.
1	they weren't interested, remember? so your god punishes children for not being a member of the right 'club'. your god sounds more and more like a monster every time you mention him. once again, like with archie i have been wrong to assume you a bigot, you're a xenophobe.	and if jito's gay friend is teaching the kid that gay sex is fine and is failing to lead the boy into the truth about jesus christ, then imo he isn't a positive role model.
1	first of all, let me just say that that is an excellent whitesnake song. but i'm a little surprised!emoticonxwow all the complaints i got about giving out my personal problems and here you are complaining about wanting a relationship. does no one else see the irony in this? the problem is obvious to me. okay i take that back, it really isn't. does going to kichen supply stores really help?	i don't think it is doing you any good.

1	And if the majority supported banning Christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? Civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.	The fact is that the public, when it exercises its Constitutional Right to decide via the ballot box, has decided against gay marriage EVERY TIME.Gays can't blame the Christian Right and the Mormons for spending $Millions on this one.

0	Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.	Athiesim has no such standard, and I don't want to hear about relative "ethics" that mean nothing, or have no longevity, or change with the winds.
0	so wouldn't that cover almost all of africa? there are so many people dying in the city streets of hunger in our own country, yet we elect a president who wants to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves, we would be helping africa a lot more than we are now (their average life expectancy is like 30). yes iraq was terrible, but guess what, other countries might think our country is terrible. that is not our concern and at least we could wait until we fixed all of our own problems first. we have poor hungry starving people on the streets of the us and we go to another country to solve their problems?	like i said we cannot solve all the worlds problems, we just need to be there for others less fortunate than ourselves.

0	i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp	he was a terrorist in jordan before he moved to iraq, and there are still numerous al qaeda training camps in jordan that we have not addressed anyway, you have been asked to show that iraq has a single al qaeda terrorist camp which is protected or acquiesed by iraq

1	But that is how creationism works - half truth. Evolution is a theory but don't make it quite clear that in science the word theory doesn't mean half-assed guess, as it does in creationism. Check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the Patterns of Cumulative Change paragraph on page 7. That is pure YEC. And you aren't a YEC?	Personally, I see no problem with this, as long as they stick to the facts in any case.

0	but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo. An argument made for slavery was that "you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do"..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned.	First of all, i can turn around right here, because i can see that you already have no idea what you are talking about.
0	you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them.	i'm not an expert on pre-colonial india but i'm pretty certain it was not the primitive land you seem to think it was.

0	That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench.	For example, Scalia stated in Heller:"Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."
1	So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?	Biology is centered around the theory of evolution.

0	I have heard that the USA spends around 40% (total) more on health care than Canada does. That would be impressive if it weren't for one fact. The USA has 900% of our population. It is your administration costs what are getting you the most. We only spend around 11% on administration while the USA spends around 25% of their health care dollars. We have a cap on how much a doctor can be sued for as well. Yes, our system isn't perfect, but it still works.Nearly 50 million Americans don't have health care at all, that is around 18% of your total population. This is quite shameful. As I've stated, the USA is the only Nation in the Industrialize world to not have universal health care.	I have my own idea for a healthcare plan... it's not at all universal, but it helps the people who need help without subjecting people to substandard care.
1	I know. Sad indeed. Orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas. As if Jesus (who is God according to Scripture) would come out and give Moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man. Get real. When the antichrist comes he'll probably be gay (one OT scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women, and Satan loves to mimic God's kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist.). Then Orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior.	First he (Orion) starts with a comedy website, but then he actually gets on this thread and starts asking questions positing "what if" Jesus was Gay?

0	And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences.	HeheI can't tell a difference between my philosophy and science, it is all knowledge that is gained through non-contradictory inquiry into reality.

0	That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb.

0	falling, did i say that 'the church alone provides for the needy?' if i did please point it out to me. each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the federal government. the constitution gives certain delegated powers to the federal government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. socialism is merely the stepping stone into communism, and i don't want to see this nation start down that path. maybe i live by the constitution because it is 'the supreme law of the land.' the question is not why do i live by the constitution, but why don't you? until the constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and i plan to live by it.	here is a thread where we can go at each others throats, so-to-speak.

0	for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?	no only does the experiences one has make that person, but so does their effect on others.
0	Evolution doesn't explain the event. The event is an example of evolution - a change in the frequency of alleles in a populatioin over time. The explanation may or may not be evolution by natural selection. You merely asserted that based on your imagined case.	Evolution is not needed to explain such an event, as natural selection clearly accounts for it.

You were already called on using incorrect facts once...you might as well say "denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day"	no...As you say, I agree things need to be looked at on a case by case bases; thats what choice is unless there are criteria.
0	What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?	There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis.
0	i lived in sevilla for the better part of year. spaniards are extremely good at staying out of other people's business. smiling at a stranger on the bus is invasive. i am not surprised most spaniards support gay marriage - most likely because they would never assume it was any of their business.	spain is primarily a roman catholic country.......they will never let the socialists or the left allow gay marriage i nthat country........... you can take that to the bank
0	Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.	because you're right and they're wrong?

1	so much bs... where should i start? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations. since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations? if a woman wants to maximize her life, liberty, and happiness, and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy, your intended prevention of that action 'flies in the face of the declaration of independence'... (not that the declaration has any legal standing.) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant. no thing, human or not, has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter's consent. 'abortive technologies'? you sound like falwell, insisting that cloning destroys life when it does nothing of the sort. please explain your laughable statement.	rovdak, are you forgetting that ivf and cloning technologies are abortive technologies?
0	based on what? i never said mr. horn did anything legally wrong. he was well within the rights of the state of texas. i never argued otherwise. that doesn't change the obvious fact that he intended to kill the two men, which is the topic of the discussion at hand.	i'm beginning to not see much point in continuing this argument with you either, because you just can't seem to understand the fact that mr. horn wasn't found guilty of any wrongdoing.
1	you are attempting to trivialize the bias we who are gay, face, against our sexuality. you try to trivialize everything we have accomplished in terms of social acceptance, that heterosexuals have always taken for granted. your assinine comments show sensitivity to no one. maybe you'd like to start a pride movement for ignorant, insensitive, jackasses? society is moving so against that group right now.	unkerpaulie, you need to just accept that he's wired that way.
0	wow. i can't believe they block it. it's not like facebook or porn. it's actually educational (sort of.) haha	but nevertheless i am glad that my school blocks it because if it did not i would be unfocused on my school work and spend the whole day pretending to do work while all i would be posting debates all period long.
0	Ill be the first to agree with the saying "If you can...and have the place to...you will" But like anything else..you have to look at the better side of things...It would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed..yes perhaps what you said might take place..but the benefits would outway them..and thats all we can ask for in life.As for our irresponsable citizens...they are already armed.	But won't the streets run red with blood if people are allowed to defend themselves?
1	Since he's commented on it several times now, and seems to have me confused with someone else, maybe he's channeling a past life or something--who knows? Better yet, who cares? :p	Not really, especially when checking a posters numbers takes about two to seven seconds (depending on your connection speed), but the amount of time taken to actually post as often as you do is must more!
0	I think it would be an exception as well.But if you see an indicator that might point to an "exception", I think the question should be asked.Consider the flip side of things. The question doesn't get asked.If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question.	But I really do believe that it's the definite exception rather than the rule, and personal ideology shouldn't be made part of something like a job interview.
0	This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism.	Yet, since only a small percentage of the earth's surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column, the claim of their having taken place to form a period of rock--life--time over the earth is therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking.
0	does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy? probably not. would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos (threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries) help the economy? certainly not. is rawls argument correct, and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals? no.	there is no indication that firms are actually competing for the top talent, they just seem to be cycling around the same faces and awarding themselves ever larger pay rises.

1	i have several that i want everyone who engages in the 'man caused global warming' debate to consider.... and i thank you for helping to illustrate some of those points for me (bold text above). asside from the points we've already discussed,... i am a bit intrigued by the fact that many of your ilk (concerned about saving the lives of millions by reversing or slowing the warming trends of the planet) are seemingly oblivious and uncaring about the millions who are deliberately killed in the name of 'choice.' isn't the decision to drive an suv a choice as well? emoticonxrolleyes	so i will ask yet again...do you have a point?
0	so God would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom. how very libertarian of you, jyoshu.but actually, are evil and freedom inversely proportionate? look at the examples i gave: slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom. on top of that, God puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things... not to mention the evil that he himself has done. murder, genocide, bigotry... the lot.if he made people with complete freedom, he MUST have made people with evil as well. why did he do that? the only reason i can come up with is that if God made everyone in his image, he himself must be evil, even partially. that that is apparent in the bible.	But don't blame God for all the evil in the world when you know one (evil) can't exist without the other (freedom).
1	And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.	Naturally, one can only observe what exists in the present.
0	Yes, it is interesting how we draw an arbitary "legal line in the sand" with regards to determining how late into a pregnancy an elective abortion is available.	I would love to see more discussion of views that are in between the two extremes of abortion illegal at all times, and abortion allowed at all times.
0	What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. For both the 'braniac" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.	In short, I think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact: a person who is brain-dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given, whereas an embryo who is "brain-dead" most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone.
0	This is a very simple, easily answerable question. Most people, especially in America, have problems with people telling them what to do. Teenagers hate being under the authority of adults. Adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law. Everyone in the world is under worldly authority, but to actually have a God who created you, which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not, that makes most people really XXXXXX off.	Not a problem in the practices of the church or the people, but in the being that we believe in.

1	your foot would do service as a colander. in australia, a weapon may be legally held for many reasons. self defence is not one of them. you might legally own a weapon for sport shooting, but use it to defend yourself. how hard is that to understand? for a supposed 'expert' not to realise that a drawn pistol is not pointing at ones foot, is a major error commonly made by fantasy gunners.	did i just see a draw pistol and shoot ones self in foot here?
1	yep. you got it.  i'm so busted.  seriously. you were a lot closer with the 'abusive participant' thing and i'm surprised that you (of all people) took the line that you did. cheap shots like that are not something that you are known for.	so if you were to make a valid point everybody would support it leaving him at a disadvantage.
1	Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.	and i quote: "so to answer your question: yes"damn im so evasive!since you asked the question again, ill answer again<snip>stuff about us being in a democratic system</snip>as a christian, if a legal matter is being contested, and you want to oppose it, you are certainly welcome to do so.

0	morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc).	that aside, where did god tell these folks to do what they did?

More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white.	It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods.

0	Yeah, it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells, but I think that if it comes out the way they hope, it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks. I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists. And yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about, claiming it is immoral (maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonXRolleyes ), but it will likely not have as many objections.	Amniocentesis, while pretty darn safe, is not without risk.First, the pregnant mother must donate the cells.The risk to the fetus is not zero.When we already have a zero risk procedure from cells that are going to be disposed of anyway.In any event, I am sure some nut job with an extremely skewed sense of morality will find a way to call this procedure immoral in some way.

I've asked repeatedly for an example of a mutation that beneficially alters phenotype and have yet to receive one.

1	So how are those gun free zones working out for you?	"Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment , nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.
0	I know what you meant.My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply "vote" it out of existence. No need for the courts at all.	I meant a decision that the majority of the population has made in regards to legislation.

If so, prove it rationally, by science.	To claim so is a contradiction, you cannot claim to know something of the unknowable.
0	That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.	this is not only because of its elusive nature to science, but also because of religious requirements.from a scientic perspective, nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law.

Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.   There are some who need to be put to death.   Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation.

0	backpedaling? how's that? my original answer is that it's wrong to force children to have sex with old men. that is my answer still. where has it changed? in fact, each post i've made is an affirmation of the one before it. how is that backpedaling? there are absolute goods and evils. that is, there are certain things that are good or bad. how is that saying something different? certain things are bad. period. just like certain things are wrong, no matter how many people think that they aren't wrong. period. is that clear enough for you? i hope so because that's what i've been saying all along and you'd have to be high to think i've changed my position.	penfold, now it is only 'certain' behaviours which are 'inherently' evil across all cultures and mores.
1	You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death.	If you want to press your argument further you will need to construct an argument as to why "putting someone in the position" obligates you to sustain their life, and when doing so you may want to examine the consequences of that position, to see if you can apply it consistently.You put it theretherefore you are responsible for itisn't, in itself, an argument.

0	Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion, as we all do. Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception. The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour. So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human' as and when it suits their purpose.Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like: some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human, then it IS. It isn't. It's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother. You can't deny that.Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue: in the meantime, the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body.	It's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus, which has a separate blood system, and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person...
1	well, it's nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive (rather than actually wanting to discuss it) to the request was indeed correct. can't say i'm surprised though. this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he'd find real disagreement (gasp!) for as long as i've known of him, usually choosing instead to throw his easy 'drive-by' insults from the peanut gallery. basically, he's a coward, and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll.	he's been doing it for almost a decade now, and none of us are fooled.

1	oh yeah? you can't out-post me! i type about 20 wpm. i still look at the keyboard when i type... which means, ultra-focus! i can switch between my right index finger and my left index finger. i'm a posting machine... try me.	i will out post off you any day of the week pal.
1	do you know what a marriage is under the law? oh yeah, that's right, a legal union. they are the exact same thing just with different names, its like if i had two identical roses and called them joe and sam, they're still both the same rose.	people will definitely look differently on your resume if they see 'legally united' over 'married'.
0	Exactly, which brings us back to square 1. Creationism is based on religion, and Evolution is based on the Scientific method, but is not proven. Creationism isnt even near being proven. So, why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children?	As is pointed out, opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with "creationism".

1	VoR is about as Catholic as the Archbishop of Cantebury. I'm curious about what I'm right about though, seeing as I asked you whether you think that medically un-necessary abortions should be legal or not.	Yes, you are 100% right; but the moment I say otherwise, VoR chastises me for not being Catholic-enough.
0	So for example if I say "you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are "a part" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.	You claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of “empirical fact”, this is just not so.
0	You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth emoticonXRolleyes An egg is NOT larva, and larva is NOT a caterpillar, and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo, and a embryo is NOT a fetus, and a fetus is NOT a baby, and a baby is NOT an adult. I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!	you yourself were once in exactly the same position and condition as an unborn child is now, and look at what you have become.
0	hun dont let no ones opinions bother you. no one matters but you, because your living your life and its your body. i personally think everyone shold hold off till 16 but im not going to insult you because thats just plain retarded. what gives you people the right to insult someone for asking a question? im not talking about freedom of speech im talking about being a nice person. nobody has manners anymore, i swear.	and you, phunting, need a thump on the head from my brolly!
0	so in what way are the sperm and egg not human pray tell? are your sperm/eggs from some other species? are they lizard life? elephant life? what kind of life do they have (and you admit they do) outside of human life? sorry but sperm and egg are human and they are alive, how can you deny both statuses? oh yes if both sperm and egg are living matter then the claim 'life begins at conception' is patently false. i will assume you modify that phrase now to be 'human life begins at conception' but that is also clearly false on the face of it.	at no time did i state the component parts of this seperate, human life, were dead.
1	oh yeah because someone else getting involved and helping them wage war on palestine for daring to live in their own country is really likely to prevent the war from escalating.	they need support from someone else before wwwiii is started.

1	Ah, historical inevitability. I had no idea you were a marxist, Steeeeve! Unfortunately for you the same argument applies to the collapse of capitalism. And once again you conflate capitalism and freedom. Have you never heard of anarcho-syndicalism? And why is someone more free when their life is controlled by corporations than when those corporations are restrained by a democratic government?	These countries haven't been around that long remember (in terms of the type of government).
1	Hey that would be great. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners of military service age and ability to own a fully automatic rifle. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners to train with the weapon. The law would FORCE VOR to keep his rifle clean. Hey VOR how about it? Keep your rifle clean or go to jail. I'm not talking about my rifle, I'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean. How about you?	Every round of the military's ammo is acounted for, because they don't want them waisting their money...

0	no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status.	that most people actually do have reasons for their beliefs, and that the world doesn't always line up with the all-or-nothing 'equality-obsessed' modern gay pride movement?

1	And Sotomayor argued that the American people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. What's your point?	Former Supreme Court chief justice Warren Burger complained about the NRA having too much influence in government and misleading the American people:
0	That's a bit of a sidestep. Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc. There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide. Frankly, I think it's easier to do the latter (yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty).If you want to make an argument, then make an argument. But don't call abortion genocide; that's just dumb.	[snip]Abortion supporters are infuriated at the notion that abortion is comparable to the Holocaust because they incessantly argue that the unborn aren't people.
0	So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say "Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."	He said it in Genisis, and yes the Bible is inspired by god, No its not poofed down by him but through his prophets he did get his message accross.
0	But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.	Geologic time/millions of years ago (mybp)/days per year late Precambrian/900mybp/487 days earliest Cambrian Period/600mybp/424 days early Ordovician Period/500mybp/412 days middle Devonian Period/370mybp/398 days Permo-Triassic boundary/245mybp/386 days "Jurassic Park"/180mybp/381 days end Cretaceous (Chixulub)/65mybp/371 days
1	I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation.   PS...from "our" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain.	Sorry, but that is nothing but hearsay from our point of view.
1	wow!! your such a guy! i bet you watch lingere womens football too dont you. womens basketball is on a much higher level then men. i bet you couldnt even tell me what a shot clock, three point shot, foul shot, or even what layup is. maybe if your tried watching womens basketball you would see how it is on a high skill level and how some wnba teams could beat mba teams.	the skill level of the wnba is nothing special and even a mens minor league team could beat them and since i don't watch minor league teams play i don't watch womens sports.
0	That's not something you can really blame on the pro-life movement. In fact, a lot of effort in the pro-life movement does go into helping single mothers. Many pro-life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways, including financially.	I can appreciate this slant, however I think that a true feminist approach would be to support women who want their pregnancies by finding solutions to the reasons they feel an abortion would be their best choice.If we want to have a child, society should be backing us up on that.

If you had an online subscription or got a copy from your newsagent you could read the whole thing, unfortunately with this one the intro rambles on a bit and doesn't get to the point till the second column...	Am I missing something, or does the linked article have nothing to do with what you said?
1	If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.	but should also deal with how information is gathered, and different ways of analyzing it as well as different hypothesies rather than what is thought at the time to be the facts.

1	I get what you are trying to do but it doesn't work. You might as well say "let's print a bunch of money...pay off the debts...and then force people to burn it!".	I know what printing money can do, so when I proposed that we print money I also proposed ways to dampen the inflation it would cause.
0	And for good reason. Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with... electrical engineering. Examples: Walter ReMine, Fred Williams, etc.	Of course, they threw in that he's a prof. of Electrical Engineering - they couldn't help XXXX a little smoke to haze the issue.

0	But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against "choices" is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices.	Therefore only they know what's best for them and they should be the one making the descision.
1	because you wanna be wrong all the time...that seems like a good reason :)	...why I should be a liberal.
0	If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it.	This one has to do with babys in the woumb "Befor I formmed you in the woumb, I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet amoungst nations" Jeremiah 1:4-5I think this is rellavent because God wants everyone to be a prophet who he can work through.

0	I think I posted that awhile ago. Its huge BS. Thats like saying "Civil rights hurt blacks". Even though abortion may have some unwated side affects, its no where near the emotional and physical pain and suffering for the rest of your life than a forced pregnancy. Just goes to show that the pro-life movement is desperate.	http://www.catholiceducation.org/art...on/ab0102.htmlI actually haven't read all of this article yet, but it looks interesting.

1	Trying to argue with a person who is babbling nonsense is not my idea of a productive time to spend my time. I've explained myself and that's the end of it.   You can label my posts anything you want but that doesn't mean anything. It just means you are proficient in throwing out insults. So for purposes of this discussion I crown you the "insult king" of this forum.	Considering how Symbiote has you running around in circles trying to pathetically defend your contridictions, apparently it is you who does not understand.
0	And the point was, Benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. If you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. If it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. If it is a web page, then the URL should be given.Even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. Generally AIG is really bad science and isn't very interesting. It is misleading, intentionally. However, on these boards are familiar with their stuff.	Oh, and yes that is where I got that information, and took it directly from their web page.

0	Don't be so faithful in our laws. Remember prohibition? Of course, I myself highly doubt that Obama will manage to ban firearms, but mark my words, he will do anything in his power to restrict them.	This difinitivly shows that he believes your right to own firearms should be taken away.
1	could it be that they've finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms? each time the control-lobby comes up with an argument....they get shot to pieces. (laugh out loud!) it is interesting to note that both of the democratic front-runners for 2008 favor gun control. with the recent death of charlton heston, there's a weakness in the armor of the nra. i would go on a handgun buying spree, but i already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call 'the little alamo'.	where in the hell did all the anti-gunners on this board go?
1	Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.	Imagine what proof for creationism that would be: we can only see stars out to 6000 light years or so; looking at old star charts we realize that people 1000 years ago could only see stars out to 5000 light years; and as time goes by additional stars appear in the sky as the light from them finally reaches us.
0	we could make this a little contest i suppose and see who gets the most right. for the primary categories anyway. picture, acting, directing, writing, any others? also definitely say what you think will, and what you think should.	i'm not to sure but i think it happened around the late 90's when hollywood decided that it was mainly ilm going up against industrial light & magic (for anyone who doesn't have it click, they're the same thing.
0	When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified.	…as the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets.” behe wrote this in 1996, and since then it has only gotten worse for the atheists, no matter how much they dance.

1	Half of the country is stupid enough to think that four (or eight) more years of Dumbya would be good.	I'm not paying a lot of attention to the "race" down there, but can anyone honestly say that McCain would be a good president?
1	I was under the impression that he was referencing the video...since he always interchanges the words embryo and fetus I just rolled with it.   Secondly, an embryo does have instructions for a brain...while a plant does not. I guess the answer hear depends on the ever evolving definition of "mental existence".	Therefore its mental existance is the same as a plant.A fetus is not a embryo.
0	Then why doesn't He answer prayers like He says He will in the Bible?   So is Jesus, aka God, a liar?   Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo's life to be saved really God's child? Gee, I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor, priest, or what have you, that prayed but God didn't listen because that religious leader is a fraud? Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!	* i wonder how much i would get paid to make up another idea for evolution and convince people its ture.
1	gee, i'm just bowled over by your mature and articulate counterargument.emoticonxrolleyes we all know genitals have nothing to do with sex.	grow up... this is not about sex - far from it... geeesh...
0	You have this habit of making sweeping claims with little to no substantiation.And even if we were to completely ignore LeVay altogether, there is MOUNDS of other evidence showing a genetic cause.Like I keep pointing out, but nobody on your side of the fence seems to realize, NARTH's OWN CITED REFERENCES say there is a genetic cause!	and the nutty professor from UC San Diego Simon LeVay who's myopic bent to show... and who's grant was provided to show that there was a genetic cause, failed miserably in doing so.
1	Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that "evolution" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance.	Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.
0	Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it...........That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people............They can't win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the courts....It won't happen.get use to it................	The justices are not to be the puppets of the legislature or the president.
1	Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world.	Nice observation, chum, but the real God - The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - is alive and well and wants to see you when you die.
0	And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is.	Man stabs, kills 8 children outside school in China The biblical end has got to be near.
0	All of these examples are scientifically recognized as human life with a unique genetic code.	My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, fetus, etc., is a Someone.
1	I have no idea what "women's rights" might be either. You could try to explain that to me while you are at it.	Now think "women's rights" but pretend you really don't like women, assuming you need to pretend.Same thing.
0	the word touched me in a bad place... i think it was at summer camp or something... i'm still scarred.... no but seriously even i don't believe that... how exactly is word spiritual? is it intentional? based upon the interpretation an individual gets from it? seeing as how the history of the bible itself and it's original writings, many interpretations, denominations, and debates over itself is construed it can hardly be seen as itself being spiritual. is it possible that through god the manuscripts and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality? yes. but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly isn't glowing with the essence of god.... it's debated if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exists has the essence of god to this day...	and you never know when a word of god will touch you, because the word itself is spiritual.
1	So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing? What's this world coming too? LOL	Hmm....some opposition to the petition...More left wing ideology at work.
0	the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex. there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals. in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds. and why shouldn't they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right. if you don't qualify then you don't enter. by all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.	ah, well, then you in you 'broad and unprejudiced view'emoticonxrolleyesemoticonxrolleyes can obviously tell us those supposed myriad other views.
0	As in we, do you mean we the USA or we, the World ? Because this is a World wide issue and not something the US can solve on its own in any case.	Sorry, I expanded my definitions here and was not polite enough to inform the rest of you :) I was not meaning to say JUST that nothing would be done about global warming (though I see now that it certainly appears that way).
1	Your posts read like gibberish when you fail to complete the thought. Try to be more careful in the future.	Crick is both a Nobel Prize winner and an evolutionary [biologist].
0	To be honest...I don't know. But I do know that to argue something is false because the consequences are not desired is a logical fallacy (Appeal to Consequences).So is the argument I posted earlier (posted below for quick reference) true or false? And if false, why?A) Only science should be taught in science class (this is why creationism should not be taught in science class).B) Science is a collection of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.Conclusion: If A is true and B is valid then science class should only consist of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.	Maybe a list of what is taught as science now that would be disqualified would simplify things?
0	The short answer is that it isn't. See the details here: Phil Plait	If one does the math backwards on it, the Earth cannot be as old as evolutionists claim it to be, can it?
1	Why? Would you rather get stabbed to death for twenty minutes than get hit in the head with a bullet? A desire to have suffering extended - hmmmm...	I'd still rather be chased by a person with a knife than run a zig zag pattern in an attempt to evade a bullet.
1	i was not trying to convince anyone. so what the hell is your point man? oh right there is no point. you are just trying to be an uncouth lout.	after reading what you wrote 0 people were convinced that the original quote wasn't funny.
0	None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about "information" or something.	http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmOne poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..." In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment.
0	For once I agree with you. Your wrong on your thoughts and views with evolution but your right in saying that abortion is wrong.	abortion is bad, there shouldn't be a need for it in the perfect world, but i'm not going to force my morality down your throat and force you to abide to MY principals while demanding you abandon your own.
1	so was dominating and enslaving of women. doesn't mean we should do it just because it has historicity.  actually i've heard this idea by numerous people, on both sides of the issue. i can see the merits myself--give couples' benefits in a way that doesn't utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with. that way at least cultural marriage doesn't have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group's cultural and ideological views.  by the way, what do you mean by 'anti-gay' in your phrase 'anti-gay people'? that's always important to nail down.	however, they would never be willing to give this up, so by denying gays the right of those same benefits for the same commitment, it is just pure and unadulterated bigotry.
0	23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so.	Do you know of any other crimes that your are guilty of when your are innocent in the past then the law makes you guilty later for a past event?If the speed limit is 40 mph on Monday, the law makes it 30 mph on Tuesday, are you guilty of speeding when it was Monday?
1	yeah, archie, i don't know what i was thinking. how could i form an opinion on the deeds of you and easy after about 6 years of interacting with the two of you, and watching the abuse and vile you spew on everyone who doesn't agree with your hate filled rhetoric? sorry about that, i must have been thinking of two other ignorant, insulting xxxxxxxs.	after you've spent 5 years volunteering for free, feeding and clothing the poor, and preaching the gospel at a run down christian rescue mission to ex-cons and the drug-and-alcohol addicted, as i have, then come talk to me about works.

0	What good has come from religion? None that I can see.	And when that good is pointed out with real examples, you change the subject to something that ignores the point, such as "ignorance is never good" or something like that.
1	I am still waiting for you to tell me why the gay priests only molested boys.......It has to do with how they are physically contructed.........	The sex of the child victims does not tell us the adult sexual orientation of the criminal.
0	'Self-defense' never enters into it, imo. Unwillingness to share ones body is not necessarily self-defense, so this does not apply.	She argues the child is not merely a stranger, but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self-defense.
0	No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic.	Is it irrelavent?
0	so? the assertion was 'evolution is based on evidence - what do you have' suggesting that one side has 'evidence' and the other none. i am simply 'balancing' it out by showing that the assertion isn't black vs white as made out.	it isn't the same as the nest day.
0	Somehow I don't think a high percentage of Ham's "facts" are facts.	Why sure, I'll simply report the facts and let you decide, unlike msnbc!
0	What is incredible is that this is probably the most enlightened response I can expect from this crowd.	Whoda thunk.As aboveHow about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.
0	yet everything in that site is cited with sources such as cnn and what not. i understnad the florida right to life is not credible to our discussion(as they are not neutral) however the things they cite are...and that is what you should look at. so murder is a subjective term now...i laugh at that. your point was what again? they fact that vor didn't prove his case and never does? i don't understand....however, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones).	besides, what is 'extreme?'
0	it's not a state's issue from a gay rights perspective, if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same-sex couples is illegal in marriage, as it did for inter-racial couples. what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage, be called? we already have such a contract. there's no need to totally re-invent the wheel at this particular time. foundit is correct. it's telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage.	foundit, obviously you have never actually bothered to read the libertarian position on marriage, which is to replace it with contract law, before complaining about it.
1	a bit over the top here eh? quicksand?...butcher babies? wow...very sensational... i have a question for ya ez? do you own any slaves? do you have a beard or long hair? have you stoned any non-virgin brides lately. seeing as though you are so adherant to the bible....i figure you at best have smited a neighbor or two this week?	if you had the missing link you people would parade it around like your long lost messiah.
0	so what? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards. he believed in freedom but owned slaves. wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color. this stance is very consistent with his double standard. he was also an adulterous, womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves. so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children.	whosoever shall be guilty of rape, polygamy, or sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.
0	Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.	if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died.
0	So, you don't see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun?? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one.	I don't see how this makes her as an anti-gun candidate.
0	who said pregnancy is the only bad thing? we already talked about ceverical cancer. furthermore, condoms don't always work...bad protection. maybe not, but wearing a bright red sign that says 'stalk me' sure will get the ones that are out there. your limited world shield you from the realities of life...which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents. aren't you a warm-hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum... does anyone else think this is rather odd?	it would make me think about it again.
0	Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments........	Welcome to the United States of America, where, if the people have anything to say about it, RELIGION DOES NOT MAKE UP THE LAW!

1	So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?Interesting...	And I sincerely do say this out of love.
0	However, so much of the sex, in fact, most of the sex that happens, gay or straight, does not lead to reproduction. Why is there not the same aversion to oral sex, masturbation, condoms, dating, etc.? No one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights, be excluded, or should not be equal, provided those people are not gay.	There are too many holes in that idea.
1	bitm (or whomever), are u sure that you weren't banned because you were caught blatantly lying? cause that seems pretty actionable to me. and welcome back broker! we've missed you're sensible conservativism!	admin, can you please search into this and let pnac know how wrong he is?
1	geeze, oldsarge, i'm sorry you missed the rabies shots when they were passing them out. i'm surprised to see you still around frothing at the mouth.	from what i have seen of your prior posts you wouldn't know a value if it slapped you.
0	this is rather naive. who would willing condemn themselves to hell? many people commit sins regardless of the punishment. here's a little conversation to save time... i understand texas has the death penalty. are there any muders still going on? yes. why? who would condemn themselves to death? some people don't think they're going to get caught. they don't want to die themselves, but they just plain think what they do, they can get away with.	well, if god actually exist than so would hell, and who would want to go there.
1	ok to lie?? no. having people preaching 'the evolution of species from a cell to every living creature and plant life on earth', and tell me 'its darwin's origin of species, you should try reading it sometime', after i had just presented them an entire paragraph from hitler's meine kempf - entertaining! having your beloved talkorigins crew flunk the test straight-up as they were asked, 'who said the following, _________, hitler or darwin?', while going a whopping 0-3 for a revealing score of zero............ ...............priceless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	ok, now i follow you: it's ok to lie through your teeth, as long as you are entertained by the results that follow.
1	1) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted?? if you can't say its because you are a typical anti american liberal. 2) nothing to suppoprt it? if anti-american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives.  the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range. on the far left you'd have romney and on the far right you'd have ron paul. now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution.	and once again you have only your twisted opinion and nothing to support it..
1	So it doesn't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless, whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s: they are both equal? What planet do you live on, for it sure aren't the real world...	It means you wealth is unequal..we are talking about just people.
0	No, Creationism is the specific idea that the creation story in Genesis is literally true (creation ex nihilo, direct creation of organisms, global flood, etc). It is false.	It is simply the study of how we were created, just as evolution is the study of how we "evolved".
1	Where is the government in this? Clinicians made a clinical decision, and hid behind a non-mandatory guideline, which was set by other more senior clinicians, expert in their field. Assuming the woman's very detailed recall of the stressful series of events is accurate, perhaps it was God's way of telling this unmarried mother that after five previous miscarriages, she still wasn't getting the message.	and here is what you get when the government gets a hold of it.
0	"Supposedly"? You ran from those threads. You are the one making assertions that you don't back up. You are the one unwilling (i.e. unable) to show that Arctic foxes can adapt to a Phoenix summer. You are the one who keeps ignoring (what I will henceforth refer to as) The Chihuahua Challenge. For somebody claiming to be so clearly right and so obviously vindicated by the evidence, you've done nothing to show it, and you've done everything to run from it.	It's funny how you intellectually-inept fools resort to talking about how I was supposedly outdebated or embarrased or whatever in other forums yet you are unable to do it here.
0	Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.	Belief that memory and free will exist but do not take up space does not require belief in a personal god.
0	It won't. I'd think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active (a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion. Like vehicle insurance she may never need it, but going without either one is plain stupid.	It's still illegal for over the counter under the age of 18.Wait a minute, I fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not.
1	With a standing president breaking the law to 'protect' you, this should be expected.	People can be picked up, driven by someone not drinking, or use other transportation (if they live close, walk, maybe public transportation).
0	Welcome back! Going to stick around for a while to debate the issues? I hope so. Let's see. How am I going to stop the employee. Hmmm...perhaps proper pre-employment screening, proper security screening for all airport employees as they come to work, random surveilance of airport employees, tougher penalties for those commiting such crimes...etc. There are many ways to do this. Remember that no security measures are perfect. We will never be safe, only safer.And what is your point about weapons/guns? I don't get it.	How are you going to stop an airline employee that has access to the airplanes from hiding a gun onboard the airplanes for terrorists to use?
0	Again? What do you mean? I am talking about different sciences per se. What is your question?	Again, how does this apply?
0	economic understanding does not come from a series of graphs and equations that come from a man who has no understanding of how humans work. the economy is not some mechanical machine, it is an organic mass of all 7 billion people of the world making millions decisions every day. behind all the smoke and mirrors, all this man said was this, in other words, concluded bullshit is still bullshit.  and your second point, companies also compete on a technological level, if they aren't as advanced as their competitors they generally go out of business because people want the better quality/cheaper product. what is the states incentive? getting re-elected? oh wait, thats easy to do when 95% of voters have no clue as to what is going on and only think about politics for 5 minutes during the elections.	this is harder than it sounds because we are continually having crises.
0	Finally someone answered the question. Thanks. I thought it might be the government.Does your government attempt to do this?What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?	Well guns are a pretty good deterrent from the government trying to take away my rights.
0	Been saying that ever since the first time I heard about creationsism.	The end.
1	Ah, so we shouldn't get all stirred up because little girls are singled out for slaughter?Please excuse me for having misplaced priorities.	Some men do not like women, but some women seem to hate men, for reasons unknown to me
0	You yourself said you don't even know what the gun laws in California are. Yet you're saying there you believe they have legitimate tests?	They appear to me to be legitimate safety tests to assure quality of manufacture and assembly.
1	So, if a baby is having trouble breathing that's been born already, you don't consider it a 'person'? Methinks you've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all.	Among other things, the newborn must obtain its own oxygen and its own nourishment.
1	Hey, maybe some chosen by God religious fundamentalist will offer up his own daughters to be gang-raped, and then later have sex with those same daughters and children by them. You know, the way Lot did in the Bible. The one Peter called "a righteous man".	We all hope that Mass will be reclaimed back to normal life,away from this wicked glbt activism.We barely won back our California from this sodomite hell by voting Yes on Prop 8.San Francisco is a modern Sodom and Gomorrah where the abomination takes place.

1	Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago. My beef has been the resident "experts" here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand. That, by the way, is found in Economics 101. But you knew that, didn't you?So now, it's a "technical" correction. What's next? Some wisdom from Joe Granville or the Elliot Wave Theory?Ball in your court.	And if you think that inflation has no effect on the price of oil or any other commodity/stock, then you're either ignorant, stupid or both.
0	well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels.	and i know that most christians embrace things like the ten commandments, which are ot all the way.

1	Ahhh I see so God was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor. Like how Sodom and Gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor.	BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LOVE GOD AND THEIR NEIGHBORS AS THEMSELVES.
1	Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.  Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans?

1	Actually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in "evolutin" [sic]. The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested. It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate. It is based on evidence and not faith.	ok were supposed to believe in GOd and then believe in evolutin...
0	I think you are on to something.The problem I see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $$$ and propaganda.Here's hoping now that there's a new sheriff in town.	So basically either the public plan attracts most Americans, and our system gradually evolves into single-payer or because the floor prevents a race to the bottom, the public-private competition raises the bar on care and efficiency, improving quality and cutting costs, even in the private insurance plans.# The standards would be kept by a strong government watchdog.# What do you think?
1	Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage. So by all means don't marry a man and the problem is solved.	3) Of course if you throw out morality as a basis for law, there's no reason, other than economics, to not allow gay marriage.

0	So what's the deal when GWB "gives" $3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $6,000, the family can't make up the difference and the $3,000 goes unspent. All we've accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury. You think it's a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it? You're thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus.	Seems like you criticize him for allowing the government to "give" something, then criticize because it's not enough.
0	besides pain, there is a plethora of experiences that take place in a person's mind that cannot be yet detected by science. imagination, taste, dreams, art appreciation, etc. even though these things are real, they cannot be quantitatively described in physical terms, so they cannot be treated by science	Is there something physical explained as well by non-materialistic methods as well as Electricity is explained by materialistic methods?
1	Ok, if Max is a hillbilly for his punctuation, then you, Ray, aspire to hillbilly-hood! Max hitting some typos while talking about other's intelligence was funny . You going after someone's English is just plain ludicrous! Do you really not know how awful your writing is?	Max has outed himself as a hillbilly who cannot spell or incorporate correct punctuation.
0	That's the standard dance. Victor Stenger didn't say it that way. On the back of his book, one review puts it this way;	Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah, not that there is no God.Now, if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that "a Noah's flood-causing God" does not exist, then kudos.
1	i would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. they have no buisness doing that. very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. its simply a hobby. men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. our rights are going out the window fast.	then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case?
1	Oh, gee! There goes my irony meter. It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence. Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone.

0	Are you sure? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair. Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone.	Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions.
1	reckon you'll be eating your own words in due time, moose.  not from what i've seen so far in your posts. keep plugging, though, you may find god yet when you run out of all those ill-conceived arguments against him.	hey, answer the question: is there any possible information you could ever recieve that would weaken your belief in god?'

0	It is disappointing that you would continue with this mistake. I said that God is both knowable and unknowable. You simply think that equates to the same thing, and thus you argue against what you believe I say, rather than what I said.	described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is).

0	lol, what did you mean by that? i'm not sure, and dont want to assume the tone you infer with. i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify. ps; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper', although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does'. @ simone, no worries hun :)	if a woman wants to have a leg amputated, that although crazy in my view, is her right but, as you well know it we are talking about the life of a baby in the womb.
1	that's not what the bible says. you're playing word games. what next? numerology??? i mean, i can play around with interpreting too. i can take 'roses are red, violets are blue' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to. let's see, roses represent love, and red is the color of blood. a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers, and blue means sad. so what 'roses are red, violets are blue' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful, and people with 'small things' are sad'. bet you never knew that's what it was really saying!	so, if you look at it properly, we can see that genesis is saying 'god formed man as a potter forms clay out of flesh and blood'.

0	fine. thank you.  what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus. how do you define the moral consensus? in attilas case, would that be among the huns? among the hun ruling elite? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he (for the sake of argument) has no intimate knowledge?  now why should he act in accordance with the consensus?  this is not completely clear to me. so, do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned?	i'm not going quite that distance: i'm saying that moral values are expressions of approval/disapproval that don't arise from rational deliberation, but from the affective part of human nature.
0	good question.  let us say that dawkins is my teacher.  in the ben stien interview , dawkins said that evolution is fact, as much of a fact, as we can know anything to be a fact... ok?!?! dawkins also says that we do not know how life originates from inornanic, nonliving compounds and he says, that, he doesn't know and no one else does either. ok!!?! well i do not accept that as an explanation - so - i guess i am not blindly following this irrational line of logic. i would have to say that - i am not being 'indoctinated'. at the same time, dawkins has nothing to teach me so i guess i am not being 'educated' either. hmmm. i guess i would have to say that in this case i am - neither.	care to guess on which side you fall?
0	you wouldn't be a commodity at all if you weren't willing to sell, you'll be hunted though. i guess you could rent out your labor for a time if you somehow didn't get hunted and weren't willing to sell your genetic material.	why would you sell your genetic advantage to other people?
0	not according the SCJ of Mass. This was part of the grounds of their ruling FOR marriage in Mass.	That ruling was based on race, not gay marriages.Totally different.
0	and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant.	it may help to look at election in this way (wow, i almost wrote evolution emoticonxic)... god is deserving of all glory.
1	a majority of the planet believes in a higher power, so i allready have the majority agreement on this. how about you come up with a test to see if god doesnt exist... well? i'm waiting.	ok, since according to your claim, god is a natural part of us and everything in our universe, you can come up with a way to test for that claim.
1	Like I said, Catholic school. Or it could be that you're like 80 years old or something, because nowadays, if you talk about God or the Bible, then you don't get in trouble, you get criticized and made-fun-of, not only by your peers, but also by teachers.	they tell me what to believe.

1	You mean the guy who didn't tell his own cabinat he was going to Argentina to go get a little.. and left a power gap because no one knew where he was? You mean that guy?  That is a heck of a lot worse that actually having an affair. Eliot Spitzer at least had the decency to resign when he got caught being a hypocrite.   I personally don't care about his diddling with some woman.. although it does make him a hypocrite since he ran on the 'family values' campaign. It's that little thing about leaving his duties behind without communication that is the real destruction the public trust.	and 'cheating on his wife mark sanford' has to do what with electing big blabbermouths with nothing to say and absolutely nothing in the brainbox?
0	Falling, the fact that the homeschoolers you mentioned don't choose to socialize with you, doesn't mean they're not far more capable of functioning in the "REAL WORLD" than you might think. I would not choose to socialize with you in the "REAL WORLD", and you most likely would not choose to socialize with me, but that does not make me your social inferior!	i know almost as a fact that they would be much better off if they were not protected by their parents and allowed to live in the real world.
0	Actually, no. If it had not been for the gay couples and the organizations who helped them fight for equality it wouldn't be an issue now, but it would still be an issue.	Had it not been for Activist judges in Mass.

0	you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons.	it is clear that poland is a conducter of washington's will and ambitions in respect of the future of european union and they don't even try to conceal the fact that they see poland a wouldbe leader of europe which will certainly mean the end of eu as such.

0	if you check again you will find they do have self defense shootings in the list as well as accidents. the point is, as even you have now pointed out, the number is flawed. the source, vpc, knowingly used false data to further their claim. therefore eliminating any validity to their claim.  you and brady continue to trot out biased and inaccurate sources to back your arguement. you should stop, it does great harm to your credibility. wow, you really can leap tall mounds of logic in a single bound. what evidence do you have that any of these deaths would have been prevented by banning concealed carry? then also consider the lives saved by concealed carry, such as mine.	only a very small percentage of homicides are classified as self defense killings according to the fbi so it's improbable that most of these killings can be explained away as being self defense killings.
0	see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian.	(also a rhetorical question) with all of the atrocities in this country and the world, it seems so odd that politicians and those of 'religion,' as well as the public in general, are so interested in our personal lives.

The Yousef-Osama-Saddam link is a conspiracy theory.	i can't prove this but i suspect it is a lot of this information that is not widely shared and talked about that drove bush's decision to remove saddam.
1	What about people who believe in something so much they are willing to suffer - even die - for it? I thought you Christians were really into that kind of thing! emoticonXAngel I ask because the history of the Documentary Hypothesis is filled with those who were persecuted for daring to suggest that evidence led away from the tradition that Moses had written the entire Pentateuch. Another case of the church strangling free thought!	Bradamante: But I am already well aware of epistemological methods concerning those that seek to undermine accepted teachings...
1	of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever? the early church wasn't called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between. if imagination alone could generate heaven, you would be right. i have no reason to believe heaven exists. which are based on the beliefs of the early church, which you have already admitted existed during jesus's life time.	the catholic church wasn't the first church, unless you can show me that in the book of acts, or the gospels.
0	Absolutely true!I discovered that with my fluoride research...For whatever reason, most people take another's word for what the truth actually is instead of searching for it themselves.If the lie is an easier pill to swallow than the truth pill, they'll take the lie. emoticonXFrazzled	One of the strongest, most-repeated findings in the psychology of belief is that once people have been told X, especially if X is shocking, if they are later told, “No, we were wrong about X,” most people still believe X.

0	If substantial shouldn't be a percentage, how should it be quantified? How would you determine whether or not their prop 8 efforts were a substantial portion of their activities? And yes, as the law is currently written, it does matter how large the church is. I would suggest that those that don't like it lobby to get it changed.	By that approach, as long as religion can pull in enough $$$ in revenue, they can be as entangled into government as they like.

0	Exactly. Moreover, in Emerson the discussion of the 2nd Am. is dicta (arguments not pertinent to the verdict) so it is not a binding precedent even for the courts in the same Circuit.A question for the "original intent" crowd:What did the Founding Fathers intend with the misplaced comma in the 2nd Amendment?	the only case that I know of in which a court has ruled that the second amendment is an individual right is US vs Emerson.

JMHO, your good works will get you more rewards and a higher station in Heaven; your denial of Christ and only that will send you to Hell.
1	You mus think you're pretty smart huh? Well guess what? You're confusing common, most common, majority, and norm. Lefthandedness is considerd common and the norm. You're using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant. Good try though.  Also left handed is genetic. It's not a gene but it's genetically related to the person's physical characteristics.	most of america is right handed (so it would be considered the norm), left-handed people function different than right handed people as well as behave differently in the way the go about their lives.

0	The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.	Instead they've turned everyone's attention to genes, bacteria and viruses….and this is because they know full-well that most people know nothing about these things….Thus, they assume (correctly, unfortunately) that most people will just take their word for it.

0	@ raastee: i've glanced through your paper: i'm surprised you were allowed to get away with the sentence, 'irrationalism is a fallacy to be avoided'. irrationalism is not a fallacy: a fallacy is an apparently genuine but really an illogical argument. irrationalism, outside number theory, is merely a discourse or statement inconsistent with the use of reason.	i got a 'b' for the paper and an 'a' for the class.
0	But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the "vapor canopy" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth.	While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter.
0	No. I will never allow "the people of the country" to tell me what is best for my my life or my health.To quote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice."I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	Can't choicers stop insulting the intelligence and capabilities of the people of the country and let them view the evidence and decide for themselves whether abortion harms women's health, and if it does, whether it ought to be permitted?
0	They have changed. For example, ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species, while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species (actually, two or three species). And the differences are enough to put them in different families.By the way, ark guy, what do you know about taxonomy?	In my post I presented several reasons as to why they should have changed...everything from a changed environment down to genetic drift.
0	Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT.	How does equal protection come into play on that equation?
0	i don't follow. 'since those of specific faith...' ???? if you don't believe god, then there is no sin. those that do would choose neither of the above over another. of course, there are some here that would, but that's religion for you.	this really would be a good question.
0	Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are "better suited" than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there?	A population of bacteria would of course be better suited than another population if it could sense light.

0	But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not. And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits. Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution. Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution (along with every science) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism.	If you've noticed, I never point out the flaws in evolution to "make Creationism true."
0	Well, at least accoreding to your "because I say so" belief.

0	Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say "What might be the best..."Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.	So restricting yourself to what you can measure can have results and should not be dismissed as "bad because all restrictions are bad".

0	So gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?We are sick of conservative family types. We are tired of the closet. The phrase "we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing.	i see a similar progression beginning in america to the point that this comment itself will be bashed by those on here whose conscience has been seared to the point that they think 2 men being married is ok.

0	so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war.	people are not always following the golden rule, and that's where the social unrest and problems start.
1	Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans? Naw, I don't think I should. They're just poor people and they probably didn't vote for me.	Are you suggesting that in the event of a natural disaster you have the right to choose?
0	It's all very interesting, but you left out a critical piece of information. You deliberately omitted the fact that most of the black victims were killed by fellow blacks. These weren't murders carried out by racist white guys, they're the examples of black on black violence.	# There were 7,387 black homicide victims in the United States.
0	Well if they're automatic weapons then they're obviously importing them illegally from outside the country and violating federal regulations. You've got even bigger problems than you think.	...They have automatic weapons now," said Sgt.
1	You are just playing dumb, right? There will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment PER INSURED. Their pay will not be cut. There will be fewer of them PER INSURED. Initially the absolute volume will increase.	So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?
0	And then there's this:Alarm at routine patrols by armed police - Crime, UK - The Independent	More than 350 people are the victim of knife assaults every day in England and Wales, the latest crime figures have revealed.Last night a teenager in Lambeth, London, became the latest victim of the stabbing epidemic, dying in hospital after a frenzied attack.Almost 130,000 attacks involved knives last year - equivalent to one every four minutes - according to the annual British Crime Survey.This figure does not include the tens of thousands of assaults against under-16s.
0	We don't live on carbon dioxide. We live from the energy stored in carbon compounds when we break them down.	Not to get off the subject too far but if we could find a way to splice this into our own genetics we could cure world hunger and make it much easier to colonize other planets.

0	Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.We all lead your typical normal life.	Then you got the benefits of being a weed addict like all you can do is have weed addict friends because you don't have time for anything else.
1	I thought that the most commonly accepted date for the alleged birth of Jesus was in 4 B.C. Assuming the current calendar really were keyed on the birth of Christ, how could Christ have been born Before Christ?	Regardless of the name change, the calendars are still keyed on the birth and death of Christ...and that will be so at least until the atheists are able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentalities.
1	I didn't know neanderthals like you and Mr. Grimm had the social graces to know what to do with toilet paper.	Hey ez, I got a new roll of toilet paper with Jesus face printed on each square and I actuality use it.What better way to wipe out the hate!I am so happy that Jesus allows me to do such things and he never makes a wimpier.I guess maybe it's because he is a wuss like you.
0	oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men.	again, do you not see how there would actually be a reduction in sexually transmitted viruses if prostitution were regulated and legalised?

0	Yes I know, a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute Behe's work. From your link;	Intellegent Design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms, and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset.
1	Oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? GASP! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations. Just because their not closes binded right wing bigots doesn't mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different...	Great, and typically dishonest of you to post about the opinion of an Episcopal church which is pro gay and one of the most liberal in Souther California: All Saints Episcopal Church is an Episcopal church in Pasadena, California.
1	Obviously sarcasm escapes you....if you did not understand that remark about gun control working in Europe during the 1930's.Report me? My knees are trembling already.I believe Steeve was expressing his right to free speech.	Well, you stated that gun control "worked well" in Europe during the 30s, which was the time of the holocaust.
1	yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands. It's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves.	And what you reference does not constitute a hole in TOE, although it may be a new mechanism of inheritance.
0	of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong? either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. perhaps you are having a 'senior moment' and don't remember our discussion. i really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. if you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. if you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement.	have you ever for a moment stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong?

1	No, no, no. If humans were created 4,000 years ago, then the earth was created 4,000 years and a few days ago. At least try and get it right.	Here (Italy), people find it hard to believe that in the U.S. creationism is taught in schools.Maybe we'll copy from You, and we'll explain our children that Eart was created some 10.000 years ago, and the human race some 4.000 years ago.
0	Again, it's not the point. There are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory	Guidance by humans in the blind Watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce .
1	and a few posts later you whined about ad homs. maybe you could support that? perhaps you would prove to us that we are truly vile, evil, callous, despicable people that deserve to burn in the firey depths of hell for the murders that each and every one of us has committed? or perhaps you wouldn't.	pehaps he's matured to the point where carrying the power of life, or more significantly death over his neighbours, is not an ego-supporting experience
0	See my post above, Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument.	He could then have planted evidence that life evolved to this point.
0	I don't think people have a right to kills themselves (obviously not natural and obviously not legal right now). As for the other question, I wouldn't think a blatent disregard for the others health is morally ok.	Since you brought up the questions, I wonder what your answer would be to that second question: "Can one girl kill herself or do harmful things to her body if she chooses...even against the other heads will?"
1	by your logic, do i have to be a murdered to understand that murder is wrong? this 'walk a mile in my sandals' stuff is just bs. i don't have to be a woman to view abortion as not being moral.	so i suggest that it is very easy to say something is wrong when you cannot appreciate the fullness of the issue- a man will never be placed in the situation where they will be pregnant but do not wish to have a baby at that point.
1	My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.	The conservatives would argue that by offering same sex marriage that their persute of happiness is denied by gay people even existing and that they have to look at us.
1	I can tell that you dismissed the post below that. And I feel I can assume that you didn't read it. Odd that a paranoid conspiracy theorist / communist who concluded that communism has never led to dictatorship should accuse me of being a fanatic.	You are nothing but a troll and so I will not be bothered with you any longer.
0	How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time, as recorded by fossils?	There the remains of a dead aniomal
0	very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause	if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily.
1	More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country.	Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances.I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer.
1	nice thought. a pity you did not live in the third reich. emoticonxfrazzled if they were captured in the battlefield then they should be treated according to the geneva convention.  and if they were found in a hole then why did you remove from there? and please tell us of the 'intelligence' they supplied the only 'intelligence' they supplied was to be used in how to perfect techniques in torturing in which medical doctors participated just as the doctors in nazi germany. doctors are creepy.	see how much easier it would have been to have just shot them on the battlefield or whatever hole we found them hiding in instead of taking them into custody?
1	Oh, i thought "bullet" was some sort of slang term. Never mind.	Surely you have Microsoft Word on your computer.
0	I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.	Your position, it seems to me, turns on issues of quality of life and social justice such that children are entitled to either a minimum quality of life or none at all, and that preserving a woman's right to control over her body is necessary for her quality of life as an equal citizen.
0	i love how the creator is also just like, sure whatever .	i am happy to support your point creation effort!

I am also a person that holds the Bible in high regard.
1	But apparently they can't say no to renting the property for a gay wedding, even if they decide to just say 'no' to everyone and get out of business. go figure	No church has to marry any couple if they do not wish to do so.
0	libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual, and limited government. a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution. that's why i am surprised.	i am a libertarian because in my country, the taxes are above abnormal.
0	as compared to how they would be during a period of instability? i said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is. i'm not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on.	as to causing external instability - true it does do that, but then so does the usa.
0	Really? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird.	For the pro-life community, the issue comes down to the fact that every human being has intrinsic value and worth, and their life is valuable for its own sake
1	People make mistakes (excepting some pro-evolutionists who respond with anger and blame others of 'twisting their words'.)	They certainly tortured people at the drop of a hat however maybe they were not that upset by the heliocentric model specifically maybe it was because some people supporting the heliocentric model claimed the concept of life elsewhere.
1	Well, if you claim you can give 95% of Americans a tax cut then you'd have to be on par with Jesus.	When has anyone but a rightist extremist or a dittohead claimed messiahhood for Obama?
0	So what if he dislikes science? If he believes something else, he has the right to believe that way. My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others.	This is clearly the worst one.
1	Oh, but it does mean something to him. He can't/won't say what, but it sure isn't based on homophobia, no siree! It's just really, really important that marriage stay a striaghts only club, for reasons that can't be explained, but there's no bigotry, don't worry on that score. emoticonXRolleyes	And, since it means nothing to you anyway, you should just accept it.
0	And we all know that is what it will become. I'm willing to bet money that Marc is going to argue that abiogenesis is a part of evolution as well as the big bang. There's a clear reason why he won't accept the definitions before the debate starts.	I'm open to new definitions, but this debate should not be a debate over what atheism or evolution means.
1	Good one, Truthsayer emoticonXGood   ...a rich white woman... LOL! Gotta be from Texas. :p	Neither of the aforementioned are my "cup o' tea" so to speak but I must give credit where credit is due regardless.One other thing Whacko Jacko represents is the sheer possibilities afforded to each and every American citizen to succeed.
0	What if the surgery for transferring the embryo/fetus would be equal in difficulty, risk, etc. to having an abortion? There would then be no extra physical cost incurred in keeping the embryo/fetus alive. What would be the reasons, in such a case, to keep abortion as an option?	Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it.
1	Yes but of course was that rreally a consious choice? I see sarcasm but no real answer that is credible.......seesh if I wanted srcasm I would have watched the Orielly factor. (oh wait thats yelling and bicering) knida like politics! (oops sarcasm hehe)	any women who went through invitro and likely had 25 to who knows how many fertilized eggs destroyed must be charged by a consistant pro-lifer with child negligence.
1	A gay person is a homosexual, friend. He can't change that part about himself. He was wired that way. If you don't like the idea of gay sex, then I'd suggest you not participate in gay sex. That's pretty simple. If you don't want gay marriage, then don't get one.	I don't think gay people should be damned to Hell, put in jail, or any of that stuff.
1	Lotsa gay animals out there, man. Wonder what Jaaaman's sources are. He seems very perturbed by homosexuality.	Just a thought....Could homosexuality be the divine difference between Mankind and animals?Hmm...

1	i love it when hypocrites say that we are no longer old testament law but proceed to quote the old testament that they just dismissed making themselves out to be fools and hypocrites. you can not have it both ways. either the old testament applies, or it does not. also, do you play football, wear polyester, stuff like that? those are abominations too. for more abominations, read leviticus 11. damn, this is a jolly good time!	i also grabbed my bible to see what its says in context and it says nothing about temple prostitution or idolatry
0	his lies, his media darling status, my post above answers your question for you.	perhaps a better question would be asking why some people seem to hate him so much?
0	Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them.	On point, do you disagree that it should be the Navy's role to make the sea lanes safe for merchant shipping?
1	that shouldn't be too hard for an 'educated' person such as yourself to point out in the heller ruling now should it? there have been quite a few rulings post heller. did those courts let 'restrictions' stand? no!	they wouldn't have to avoid heller since heller recognized that restrictions on packing heat are okay.
1	Apparently someone doesn't read. Trebor was talking about me not being jewish in the following quote.	Or else show me in your Tanakh where they've been done away with.
0	Actually, I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only, but after reading the CBO report, I see that I wasn't far off. They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed.	Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married?
0	ez, can you cite an actual case where the aclu has intervened on behalf of nambla? the only person or persons with close associations to nambla that i can bring to mind is the notorious father paul r. shanley who molested countless children and was carefully sheltered under the wing of the notorious his eminence bernard francis cardinal law who was finally ousted from his cardinalship by a multitude of angry roman catholic parishioners in the boston area. dear his eminence bernard francis cardinal law was immediately taken and sheltered under the wing of the vatican and scooted over the pond to several administrative posts of the roman curia, where he was also named as archpriest of the basilica di santa maria maggiore, one of the five major basilicas of the roman catholic church.	and you and the aclu want to protect that kind of morally and legally reprehensible 'speech'?

0	i've been following the story here all afternoon bbs. i'm sorry that you're going through this, but what has scotland done to upset radical islam ? nothing that i know of. could it be they have declared war on the west in general and as a whole ? i mean, i have been told over and over again how these radical moslems are just confused souls and the real enemies we must fear are the radical conservative christians like me who actually pray for the unsaved. talk about scary people, huh ?	my mother said i was crazy to fly, but the way i see it is if we live in fear to go about our daily business than these people have won
1	Someone once said that the poor would always be with us.   I'll keep in mind that your core beliefs include the notion that what the poor really need is a hard day's work. You're a prophet I tell ya!	It makes perfect sense if that is where his core beliefs are.
0	I believe it is merely all known living species against those known by the fossil record and extinct. There are undoubtedly more extinct species that we are unaware of than living ones.	I read an article yesterday (about Evolution, Extinction, and Economics) in which it was claimed that 99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct.This sort of claim (which I've come across before) troubles me: how can it be asserted, with any certainty at all:1).
0	Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory.	We supposedly evolved from simplistic monkeys to what we are today.
0	But it, along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis, is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis. Actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is.	and nobody has ever managed to do so (though the concept of an invisible man in the sky is a little silly).
1	Why is it that people don't want to admit that it was Bush's' reckless spending on a War that we didn't need , the tax cuts for the richest 2 % of America, The Fact that under Bush they had to ADD space on the Debt clock, not to mention that he was as dumb as a rock, yet they can place all this blame on Obama who inherited this mess and has done more to get us out of it than Bush or any Republican would have done. Unemployment is High, we know this, but it was on it's way up when Obama took over because under Bush more corporations left this country , more businesses closed down, the Banks were allowed to do whatever they wanted without regulation of any kind, and yet none of it is his fault?.. Enlighten me...	And New York's assembly has been run by Democrats since at least the 1950s.

0	If there is a positive relationship between drug consumption and crime, it doesn`t seem very likely that crime would go down as a result of lowering the price on drugs (and thus rasing consumption).	I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain.
1	Yeah parents like these?...Westboro Baptist Church family disowns daughter ? 20/20 - YouTubeChristian Nutters is what I like to call them..	most any parent (except a bad parent) is going to love their kid no matter what and most people aren't evil gay-haters after all.
0	Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?	Perhaps another unwanted child spending a childhood is state supported homes?
1	How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.	And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe, then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence?
1	Uhuh! And you've got a bridge in Brooklyn you want to sell me. . . .	But, but, I am a guy.

0	I suppose the fact that Indian law only applies to its people. Who qualifies as an Indian is another matter. Many people who have as little as one-tenth Indian blood qualify for liberal hunting privileges here in Minnesota.	What would be the legal precedent to stop non-Indians from performing or receiving abortions on sovereign lands?
0	why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom.	You could also say that violent killers and serial rapists are being discriminated against for "who they are."
1	Yawn.. you are so obsessed with gay sex. I am not. Enough said.	You're a LIAR, Trebor.And you're one who defends that abomination.

0	and how do you know?? let's see evidence of this. or, it is just one of your proclamations?? that statement says to me 'i can close my eyes to all evidence, all common sense, because i believe in god'.	in the eyes of god, what you describe as supernatural, is not.
1	i love it when straight, christian folk who disapprove of gays seem to know so much about what it is to be gay - how it feels, how they became that way, the nature of their relationships and whether or not its something they can control. hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to. emoticonxrolleyes	that's what you do best.
0	we do? how do we know that? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link, but i am unaware of proof that there is no link. did i miss something?	but when it must be done under the guise of false science, there is a problem from what ive seen, homosexuality, and sexuality on a whole, is indeed a complex issue.
0	Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either.	It's pathetic, really.....yet all you anti-intellectuals will soak it up like a sponge.
1	A load of unowhat repeated for many years now. Junk science commissioned to get results that were desired. Check out lung cancer rates for Rastafarians. Nothing abnormally high. Gateway my arse.

0	It's thanks to the opposers of the theory that all this rubbish about descending from monkeys and slimeball came about, all ppl need is a bit more education and things should become clearer.	What we didn't do is evolve from any apes still living today, but our common ancestors with those apes were themselves apes.
0	Well, I forgot to add one thing: a legal notice to the gov't about such behavior.	so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?
0	My mom can only trace her family back a few generations. By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century, the records get very confusing and very incomplete. By creationist logic, we must then accept that my ancestors, white Americans, were specially created in North America by God.	And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years.
0	Well, not completely, but yes, quite the same. However, this is irrelivent- she wasn't a person, because she was in a coma. Does that give me the right to kill her? Of course not!   What about fetuses born in comas? Can we kill them?   What about people in vegetative states? After all, they arn't perfect, so let's kill them!	do you believe that if her mind was transported to another person that she would still be in her body and not in her mind?

1	However, we do give people alcohol, there are many people who drink it on a regular basis who are not addicts. What do these substances you mention have to do with being gay? Would it perhaps be okay for me to have homosexuality on the weekends or after work during happy hour?	So if a drug addict, or an alcoholic stands up and says, "God made me this way", should we accept that fact, and give them drugs or alcohol.
0	So, I guess you didn't get the memo that this country was FOUNDED on Christian/Judaic beliefs. Remember: You do have rights; to an extent.	I believe that if marriage is offered to heteros, and they seem to think it is their right to get married, then marriage must be extended equally to gay people.

1	Was she on her knees, taking lessons from you...or was she skilled already?	Dont forget my daughter...they had a video of naked men behind the bar too.We all thought it was funny.Some homosexuals seem quite nice...not grizzled old queens like some:)
0	But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent.	<snip of silly, irrelevant religious claptrap> Creation is not a necessity, but I have yet to see substantial evidence to disprove it.
0	If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it.	Those quotes have nothing to do with abortion.

Repent, you heathen!	if you are right about your god, you're going to be satan's number one hot-poker puppet.
0	Well, first, those were Hebrews, not Christians. Secondly, the scripture doesn't say they raped them, it says "keep them for yourselves." That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention. Also, the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men, so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small. However, that DOESN'T mean it was justified or right.	Also, if the Christian worldview is against rape, why does Moses say that Yahweh allows the Israelites to take the virgin children of the Midianites captive to do with what they would in Numbers 31?
0	Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis.	The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission.
1	do you actually believe that? do you have any evidence? complaining is practically the national passtime here.	go over to britain or canada where they have whatever you could possibly want in terms of social policy...except for the right to question the government and complain about the quality of living.

0	In 2000, the U.S. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides. The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25% higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year. In Japan, the number was 22.sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan.	How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year?

1	Well if no siege comes, I guess no harm no foul.	With 250 million guns owned in the U.S. today -- it's as if we're permanently awaiting a siege that will never come -- there's simply no hope of eradicating arms from the American equation.

0	No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution.	But are the mutated fish really a different species or are they merely a race, like humans with different skin colors?

1	So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.	Atheists are clearly capable of all of these, but if human beings are just collections of bones, blood and tissue, what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them?
1	Or, since he didn't have $37-million tucked away from questionable business practices and a rich daddy, perhaps he paid attention to the ramifications of abnormal deficit spending.	To bad they couldn't work the same magic on their next Republican President.Maybe Clinton better understood the downside of deficit spending and its effect on future generations.
1	Hehehe. Sounds like an American in a big SUV looking at $4/gallon gasoline with a maxed out credit card listening to fundamentalist talk radio.	Think of the flexibility the US has in regards to budgets with a higher debt load eating more of the budget in service costs.
1	And the scientific papers don't. The problem here is that creationists don't read the scientific papers. In fact, most can't even understand them.	Evolution is supposed to be science, and is said to not address religion.

You complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this?Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?	Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States!

1	Man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form. Did we invent the wheel, or discover the idea? Did the Wright brothers invent machine powered flight, or was it that they stumbled upon it? In every culture, in every society, man looks to something greater than himself. They simple don't leave it at themselves and be done with it.

1	I'm sure the response is that He could. But, y'know, God's a real XXX sometimes... (Besides, who do you think used His uber-complex biochemical engineering skills to create the prions responsible for FFI, anyway?)	My personal answer would be that if god is truly omnipotent, he could eliminate many causes of unhappiness without causing suffering.
0	14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol.	the minimum drinking age should be lowered to 14 if not 12. the main problem with alcohol is drinking habits, non-safe drinking habits are encouraged by a high age of license due to how alcohol is more likely to be consumed in bulk and away from proper supervision for those underage.
0	In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole "let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it" mentality....	How and why do you think the terms have changed, and what are the similarities between tham?

1	1868 actually, that is a link to the wikipedia article on the act. once again, the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 are not the same thing. more importantly, a store saying 'no blacks allowed' is not violating the 14th, they violate the civil rights act of 1964. furthermore, a store saying 'no guns allowed' is not violated the 2nd amendment.  time for you to read up on the constitution doc, you might find some good things in there. i'm a little surprised you don't vote democrat given your thoughts. then again, not much difference between a given democrat and your texas 'republicans' (see w bush and rick perry)	here is the enforcement provisions of the act of 1964: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_rights_act_of_1964 heller ruled that the 2a was about more than 'discrimination on gun laws' in that as long as the 'discrimination was equal it would be legal according to the plaintiffs and muncipalities'.
0	This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.	We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence.
1	Examined the record? Now it's not even the patient, just the record? Good god man! Many times, only a number of criteria must be met, not all of them. It would be like me saying that there must be gas in your car since it is running. Then you tell me that I must look at the gauge then physically take the tank off to be able to say without a doubt there is gas in it. Flat EEG in the cerebral cortex means no brain activity in cerebral cortex means PVS. There is no reason to test a swallowing reflex, a pain response reflex, or sphincter tone.

0	Yes, the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite. The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe, the Roman, of course, being the largest. The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite, and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.East to West, a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church, especially those of the east.Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?	Like the Maronite Church they practice Eastern Rites as Orthodox do, but they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.

Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.	secondly, throughout my college education (majoring in molecular biology) i have observed the complexities of the single-cell, and find it impossible to believe that it occurred by accident (though that may not be the best choice of words).
0	Because of the history of it. Well, ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state'. Let's just say that I.D. is an attempt to teach Creationism in school.	Incidentally, is the title of this forum meant to imply that creationism and Intelligent Design are two names for the same thing?

0	Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: "a revolution". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!

0	I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though.	The reason for having a gun is as you stated - to stop the crime once it has begun (though this may prevent a worse crime from occurring).
0	i would never limit myself in a debate to 'how many' generations it takes because the fact is your scientists are afraid to test such things. in the following example it took between 7 and 18 generations for guppies to change their phenotypes. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...sss-270397.php of course these guys, being evolutionsts explain this phenomenon as happening through natural selection -- death. but what have we already learned about tadpoles?? -- they develop in direct relation to their predators....including body structure. fish are no different.	on the iidb board, you insisted that if an animal was transplanted to a different environment, you would expect it's phenotype to change in response to that environment within 'a few' generations.

0	Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view.	The best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all.

0	Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.	"The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state.
1	look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice.	[url='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_related_attacks'] and yet us school killings account for more deaths in this list than the rest of the world put together (counting like-for-like situations, not rebel military actions such as in vietnam, pakistan or russia).

There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind.	I would appreciate it if some of you experts could give me some simple answers to a couple simple questions and help me with some of my doubts.
1	So then will you go the way on liberty (repeal stoopid laws) or tyranny (enact more unconstitutional laws)?	So does this mean they have to get tougher on gun control or softer before the results go their way?
1	I guess it's a good thing I wasn't replying and/or talking to you then. But thanks for your input, it has been noted.	No, Steeeeeeeeeeeeve, I don't see what you mean.
1	uhm, you do realize that humans and chimps are not the same things as dogs, cats, horses, and sharks ... right?  i am under no obligation to address the evolutionary origin every possible organism. let's review the facts. 1) i said there is a ton of evidence for macroevolution, and there is.  2) i gave a specific example, saying that i could provide multipe lines of independent evidence supporting the fact that humans and chipms share a common evolutionary ancestor. and i can.	tell me, what did a cat evolve from?
1	Rants? Obsessive-compulsive? How so? I don't insult you with every post as you do me? What's you major problem? Perhaps you need to go pray.	If you want I could reciprocate by pointing out how obsessive-compulsive your rants are.
1	so now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?  i expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? am i to believe that you are a soldier there now?  your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. i posted exactly what i meant to and you went off on a tangent. i asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if 'show me yours before i show mine?' pitiful.	if you claim that a fetus is a life, what does it matter what type of life it is?
1	All the more reason to be armed to the teeth huh,does this mean you see it our way?	There might be even more such attacks in the US if the US shared a border with Pakistan.
1	So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.	I have already asked God for forgiveness and he has forgiven me.
1	Indeed true. God created man in his own likeness and man returned the favor. Man created a vindictive, vengeful, and vicious god, according to the Bible. So where does a loving god come from?	Easily understood when man created his own god.
0	which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation.	so says the offspring of islam.....still wrong but vehement in his certitude.
0	Actually in high school I had a friend who used to be in placement. He was sixteen years old an he said he got the s*** beat out of him by an eight year old boy. "Street kids" get their XXX beat every day, pain is nothing new to them. It seems they're immune to it. It doesn't matter how hard you can hit, if you can't take a punch, then you can't call yourself street-worthy.	"Boys and girls as young as 10", the story says.They threw "rocks and eggs" at her house.They don't kill you for that in England, Texas maybe.
1	My thoughts are my own, not from some 2000 year old Book that makes as much sense as a bag of Rocks. And I have only ever called anyone a name in response to an attack on me,   If you call what you have been doing debating then I see what the problem really is.	I really don't feel the need to respond to the names you mooks end up calling me since I know my place in eternity, so have at it for all I care.
0	Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?   I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.	this is the vpc they claim to be for 'moderate gun control laws' they used to be hci.
1	Just to let you know you're welcome to come back and debate Islam, don't hurry, you've a lot of reading to catch up on.emoticonXHoho emoticonXLove	Re: transubstantiationSpock is an imaginary character who inhabits an imaginary world.
0	dear terry here, please see my post on the other side of this debate. you may think that nothing happens after you argue a debate, but that is just the start. so much more happens after a debate is created and argued. people around the world look at the debates and learn from them, make decisions because of them and create additional debates. your input can change the world. andy	but after we debate , nothing happens right?
1	Seems all the drills would broadcast when they had a leftie. Just could wait for that case of M-1 thumb or the hot one down the shirt.	But seriously that gun was such a treat it's so simple to clean, reliable and accurate in the right hands.No wonder the military is having such a pain trying to find a successor....
1	You mean your hypothetical I presume? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal.   You're a bit slow I see.	oh brother.. so what if a minority of americans wanted to legalize murder.this is rediculous.
1	Only if you include the fact that while cleaning up the water he is beating the pipe with a hammer.	", you should know that it falls in the category of A.
1	It is also enough for me to realize you people are using words without definitions.	This is enough for me to realize that you do not understand what you are talking about.
0	**True, and the confusion was my bad, as explained already. However, the fact of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, as demonstrated by Ames and by Cairns, still shoots great big holes in the darwinist assumptions arising out of your old war-horses, Luria & Delbruck '43, and its "clone", Lederberg and Lederberg '52.	However, all of that is quite beside the point in the case under discussion.
0	Oh I can easily spend $1,000 dollars an hour. If I could I would also have plenty of reason to live to be 114.	I ran some numbers and here is what I came up with....If you had 1 billion dollars, and you spent $1,000 an hour.
0	Do you? Care about gay people, that is. You keep imply that it's only their tactics you don't like, but I can't recall you ever saying that you support a persons right to be gay. So please, cards on the table. Do you support a person's right to have sex with whatever willing adult they choose? No politics, no tactics. Please, just answer that simple question.	He doesn't understand that people can disagree with gay peoples' behavior and still care about gay people.
1	ok, fine, you can use that line, but there is also a moajority that believes in other things. there's this crazy thing, called a choice. we all have that. remember? i made the choice to have sex, you're making the choice to be a total ***hole. we all make a decision, and its the strong ones that stick with them, even though there are others who dont believe the same thing.	Yet mine is right....well it isn't really mine, it is the majorities.
1	black unemployment is at 19 -20%. the economy is in the toilet, as are obama's approval ratings. and you're swilling kool aid and saying you know best? lol! that's why you liberals are dangerous. you're too steeped in folly to understand what's going on. how's that hope and change working out for you? emoticonxbouncer epicurus apparently never read the book of revelation where god levels the evildoers. and you look up to that? what's the matter with you? you didn't read it either to know epicurus is three sheets to the wind on that? that's why you liberals are dangerous.	i didn't need to vote for obama to know more than you.. considering you live in a world of delusion.
0	So the stats come from John Lott.... Wasn't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause?  http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/31/opinion/oe-wiener31 http://whoismaryrosh.com/  .	http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdgcon.html    What is so doubtful about it?
0	The whole "change the definition of marriage" is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots. They don't seem to realize that words can have several meanings.	Those who object to same-sex marriage primarily (or so they claim) because it would "change the definition of marriage" should perhaps be made aware that that train has already left the station:Merriam-Webster On-line http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/marriage Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage Encarta http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/featur...fid=1861628509 American Heritage http://www.bartleby.com/61/2/M0120200.html This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.
1	let's look up all the definitions, shall we? here's where you got 'yours': as you can see, the definition you cited is only used once, and even then it is just one of two from that source.  i notice you ignored all of the responses to you on the thread and decide to just post this piece of work without answering people. we are waiting, oh sentient one. we have shown you creatures that match all of these definitions (or at least all of the definitions that are seen in each and every source - see how alike each one is?) - now show us how humans are the only sentient beings in the universe.	or are you dr. dolittle?
1	good grief... satanist?!.. my goodness how can you say such a thing?!  i will have to ban you for even mentioning the concept of it! my dear old fellow!	if there was but one person type on the planet, not much would get done.
0	would that be legaly owned guns, or criminals who have guns (and also ues guns) for there crimes? most Gang members have guns, if they are killed in a drive by shooting, is the gun responsable, or would it be the illegal activitys?	Those who have firearms in their homes are more likely to die of murder
0	From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo...w/26satel.htmlHmmm, Teddy Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, the Rockefeller foundations, millions of Americans, the State of Indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS.Interesting, yes?	Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the "germ-plasm" of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated.
0	You say you cannot see it from the gay perspective, then you speak from that perspective as a gay man. This is confusing. As a heterosexual, if you are one, would you give up those rights and let gays have the rights?	Apparently, you have five questions.If by 'ability for inward perspective' you imply the ability to look at one's self, it is incongruent to say you are leary of our ability 'to think of life from a gay perspective'.
0	You bring up a very interesting point.   All those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well. When polled, residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions.   So, not only are the anti's disingenuous as far as what they promoted, but were so in HOW these amendments were promoted.	The authors of all those constitutional amendments ensured that there were no recognition of any other types of relationships in their wording.Why should any of us settle for something that these very same people are going to attempt to deny anyway?
1	It is only difficult to sort out if you are a neocon and fail to recognize that neocons are nothing but militant liberals.   Bush was BY FAR the most liberal president we have had for at least 20 years.   Maybe you need to research traditional conservative values.	Not at all, it's just that other posters that often agree with you in just about every way want to call themselves conservatives (they've called Clinton a conservative, Bush a liberal, etc.)
0	This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.	Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage?
1	V.P.C. once again I am shocked and awed. Why no mention of our fearless atf's  and the agents they caused to be killed. And all the Mexican citizens they have caused to be killed? Oh wait if the vpc did that it would be kinda like jumping outta bed with your partner.  SPECIAL NOTE: Some ATF agents are fearless.

0	Actually you are incorrect. The most commonly used rifles on the competition circuit are so-called "assault weapons".The "assault weapon" moniker is a term just recently fashioned to describe a military looking weapon.There are several target competitions designed solely for these types of rifles.	this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.

1	Well, you must not be a GOP lawmaker or the President of the United States. They're convinced that the only way to prevent the SCOTUS finding in favor of same-sex marriage is to amend the Constitution.	I see no way the federal government can force states to marry gays.
0	Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality. My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say "Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this..."But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?	Have you read Leveticus?

0	the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. the 9/11 commission omitted it because...??? what is this deep dark secret they don't want the american public to know? which, according to you is easily figured out anyway. 'we could blow up a u.s. ship in guantanamo bay... omg. couple of cia guys brainstorming for solutions to a problem and people go nuts. if that's the worst of what they contemplated...i'm not impressed.  i'm sure conspiracies happen all the time but they are so rare as to be insignifigant. my wife and i can't even agree on a restaurant.	in the video, one of the workers states that it has been almost 6 weeks after the attacks, and workers are still trying to cool down the steel.
0	Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by "friction".By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation.	It is not a mutation.
1	that was a cheap shot my friend.. lets keep at around an a*d*u*l*t level.. shall we?	I guess our little 14-year-old was humiliated beyond belief and decided it was best to not even try to respond to tons of evidence that refuted his/her "evidences".
1	so what is it that isn't true? are you saying nasa didn't spend 12 billion dollars developing a zero gravity pen or that russia didn't use a pencil? and since you're so anal about a simple joke, go ahead and support your claim that anything my joke says isn't true, with actual evidence. your opinion doesn't carry much weight with me.	the last thing you need in a spacecraft is powdered graphite from a pencil drifting onto electrical contacts.
1	Odd. I can't seem to find any racial slurs or racist ideology in those sentences. In fact, I don't see any race or races in general even mentioned. You're just one of those people who thinks you can win a discussion by accusing your opponents of being racist. Sorry simone, but in the real world, people can disagree with your leftist views (which are barely existent) without being racist.	When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work, because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is the beginning of the end of any nation.
0	reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary 'defense' nuclear weapon parity with russia. considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq, i'm surprised our conceit hasn't made all of me and asia scramble for nukes. pakistan, 97% muslim, hides bin laden, governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts, never a bad word about that us 'ally'. but they have nukes and delivery systems. i'd think iran believes, as we've shown, that the us doesn't spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons.	they are not going to use nukes as offensive weapons if it is going to ensure their own destruction in retaliation.

0	i think you may be very very suprised by roberts. i like some of the answers he is giving. i have a feeling you conservates may get f***cked. he is not as conservate as you think. besides even if he is conservate he certainly is not as conservate as the emoticonxcensored he is replacing.  as a citizen of virginia do you support this law that strips people of their wills and powers of attorny? http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp...41+ful+hb751s1 this is just a very mean law and will hurt many people.	you freely admit that you want activist judges to push your liberal agenda.
0	Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out.       Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?	I know of no one that is pro life believes the mother should die so the baby can live.
0	I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people.	Government is violence.
1	Well then, I guess I must be a turkey-sandwich worshipper! emoticonXAngel	Easyrider: Didn't you know - anything more important to you than Christ is your idol.
1	Maybe because it's a loaded question? If another evolution hoax were discovered similar to Piltdown man, would you reject evolution and become a Christian? :p	I asked you earlier if your conclusion about Jesus' divinity would be changed if there were any Messianic prophecies that were not fulfilled by Jesus.
1	So if I go out and buy a Brand X car and then regret it a year later, does that mean that nobody should be allowed to go out and buy a Brand X car? Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive? Sounds kinda fascist to me.	If it's really no big deal, then why would they feel that way?
1	I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above.	Ok, let's give that a try.Evolution doesn't require something to have evolved from nothing, so this isn't a valid criticism.

0	You contradict yourself. If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis.	I believe that God made the Earth only a few thousand years ago, not that much geographically different from the way it is now.
0	NOt true,California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal.	Well, of course the issue isn't "limiting" marriage, but rather making it more open-ended.
1	so a vote for an adulterous divorcee is a vote for morality? is this election being held in wonderland? i'm pretty sure mccain falls foul on bearing false witness as well.	a vote for mccain is a vote for democracy.
0	So if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence, and a devout Christian believes God is the highest form of intelligence, the Christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence?	One may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith, but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith, and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people (usually with the subclause of "Let them burn in hell afterwards", or something else along those lines).
1	Ah, so we shouldn't get all stirred up because little girls are singled out for slaughter?  Please excuse me for having misplaced priorities.	some men do not like women, but some women seem to hate men, for reasons unknown to me
1	Look who's talking.   Besides, it's a free country. It's not "Politically Correct Treborville" that we're playing here.	They have not done so, and I suspect that their interpretation of 'The great commissoin' is much different than yours.You, after all, reject anybody who doesn't believe the way you do.
1	Oh come on! Instead of turning my sarcasm on it's head why don;t you log off and go listen to some more Chuck Smith tapes? I'm sure the Calvary Chapel brigade could use another "donation."	Sexual inuendo: yet another symptom of your sexual perversion as you interpret even spiritual analogies to sex.
0	Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you "view humanity with mental existance as important" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood.	The only ones you are protecting that our view does not are those human living entities with no mental existence.
1	Tell me, how does one "steal land" from a nomad? emoticonXConfused	But it's fair to say you just insulted a number of people of faith, who donot follow Christianity, only.
0	The problem here is that Christians (such as I am) consider the Bible to be Proof.	you can not prove life begans at conception, and the burden of proof for taking away one's rights relys on proof.
1	If you had a look at all of the other threads on this topic you would see that.	Just out of curiosity, what do you mean by “we?”
0	You can do whatever you want to do with your money. The fact that you don't know any better than to do that with your money is telling, though. If you think that the C(R)SC actually does ID-based scientific research, you're exactly the dupe they're looking for.I'm serious. Do the research for yourself. I won't even give you links, because you'll XXXX them off as propaganda. Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID. I dare you.	Or is it killing you that i would donate money to an organization that opposes your secular humanist agenda so you feel you must lash out like an angry child?
1	So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves.	Because it is illegal to own a handgun without a difficult-to-get permit in New York,
0	take another look. we certainly do have our hands firmly on the levers of power. sixty us senators, a substantial majority in the house, a president who represents the death of reaganism once and for all. a solidly pro-choice president and congress. a president and a congress who understand that each of us is responsible for all the rest of us. oh yes, this country will emerge from the bush depression and the optional bush wars with a new sense of direction and a new prosperity. by the next election, there will be so few congressional republicans that they can caucus in the mens' room - provided, of course, that larry craig has not returned for a visit and is using it for other purposes. the naysayers can either get on the train or get left at the station.emoticonxsmilie	you're nothing but a sad dupe for the people that have bought and paid for the white house.
0	I'm not trying to participate in gang debate, but well..The population of "people with heart trouble" would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce. If reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off.	That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.
1	So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about.	Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch.
0	oh yes, president obama also has to figure out how to get rid of the bush policy of lies and falseness bush people burrowed into the federal government by bush during his last days as president in order to thwart the spread of science, research and reality.	but of course, if it happens after president obama has his people installed, people who believe in science and research and reality, and these reality-oriented people have taken full control of the agencies who oversee these sorts of things and have made sure that regular inspections are made for food safety.
0	Schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.	But you haven't rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause?ALITO: Well, what you have pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up, and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through.SCHUMER: You didn't think that through in 1985?ALITO: I was not involved in...SCHUMER: When you wrote the statement.
0	But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.	And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle.
1	i must be blessed to be surrounded by so many posters with a direct line to god so that they know who is saved or in hell. with christians as well-informed as this, i'm surprised god doesn't just retire and let them take over. after all, 6,000 years since creation must be enough for anyone.	that is not for us to say.
1	You mean you've spent your good, hard-earned money on his revisionist follies? ROTFLOL!! You could have had a six pack to really make your day.	I mean (retired) Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong, whom you frequently attempt to attack but whose books (by your own admission) you've never read.

How sad (and typical) that you haven't bothered to educate yourself about these things.	She isn't flushing people or potential people, and how sad it is that you can't understand that.
1	So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women?	People have to start clearing the closet... so to speak, and simply be down to earth and accept that not all your decisions are going to be popular ones, and homosexuality is one of them - and you certainly don't win fans by thinking you can leverage the guilt game on people even thinking you can draw comparisons between color [innate] and sexual preference [choice] as a basis for some perceived civil right, it is just plain and utter nonsense.
0	And if you rewind a little over 40 years, the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage.Archie's reply is a non-argument, and false at that.Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage, but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage.Little things like child rape, lack of consent, and other issues.	The reason that's the case is because there are many limitations on marriage but only homosexuals claim they are being discriminated against.
1	who knew? I wonder if I could have passed all those philosophy tests based on the philosophy I absorbed?	To have one you only need to absorb it from the general culture.

1	who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation? how od you know they are right? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation?  perhaps, as the roman elite at the time claimed, the bible was compiled, and christianity was heavily pushed, primarily as a method of controlling the people. we know the bible was heavily edited. we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured, and not by the folks claimed. isn't literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea?	yes there is poetry and symbolism, but there are also places for literal interpretation.

0	I looked it up and apparently there is a synthetic form of THC on the market, (generically known as Dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol). But it is only allowed under restricted prescription (it's a Schedule II controlled substance, the same as morphine or cocaine) and is far less effective than plant-derived THC.	Aren't there already drugs in existence that contain the chemicals that are (supposedly) beneficial in marijuana (i.e.
1	Exactly, because it's not just an issue of 'her body'. What she does (the smoker) affects other people. Thanks for missing the point.	People are not allowed to smoke in most restaurants now.
0	Humans are about the furthest thing from perfect. The bible IS perfect, it's flawless. You can't take anything from it and prove it to be incorrect. The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences. I know plenty of people who don't believe in any sort of God and aren't bothered by the thought that this is all they have, the only life they'll ever live. Maybe some people need to believe in more to live more, but all people don't.	"God' is a figure that humanity created so that life would not be dull adn so that we would have reasurance(sp) that there is an after life
1	Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be.   These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone.	There is no possible way they could "accidentally" be so off the end result.
0	And you think this a good thing? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist.	You are absolutely correct !Ray M.
0	how are they different? both can lead to depression, impaired judgement and decrease in ability. what is the difference? you can't just claim they are completely different and leave it at that. how are they different? you say i fail to provide how sleep [loss] can be just as violent as drugs. you or epaphras_faith have yet to prove that drugs can cause violence. i have just proved that sleep loss causes a decrease in ability and impairs judgement and leads to depression. you haven't proven anything more that drugs does.	what you fail to provide when saying this is how sleep can be just as violent as drugs.
1	I'll give you that one...only because I think by then women will be able to place their fertilized ovums in banks.   But then again they said the same thing about robot servants and flying cars too!	...there won't be a 66 I know that :)
0	You are missing the entire point (again). Why do you feel ashamed? Because you know that what you did is bad. I have heard from a great Australian war hero, one of our remaining ANZACs soliders (recently passed away I think) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun (WWI era) and he saw him die that it was "the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure". He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life. He knows that he did something wrong, but it was a war, and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen. You are way off the plot. But let us continue.	Because your mommy and daddy told you "no, no, no" when you did something wrong.
0	Your wrong. Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres.	Notice how the places where guns are banned have the most massacres.
1	Like the crazy idea the Earth goes around the Sun.	God is good, and humans have theorized various stupid concepts trying to discredit their inner convictions to be rampant perverts many a time....NOPE.
0	Just to contribute, I'm pro-gun, have had training in the proper use and laws in my area, and have owned weapons for more than 30 years.	While I am not a huge fan of polls, one of the positions often held by those of us on the pro gun side of the debate is that those in favor of stricter firearms law, are not familiar with firearms or current firearms law.I would be interested to know what level of knowledge is possessed by both sides of the argument.
0	Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.	I am just having trouble reconciling the idea of removing a fundamental right based on a misdemeanor conviction and was wondering if there is similar precedent elsewhere.
0	If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?	Whether the fetus is human is not something that I think is really relevant to the matter, and in any case where we give it the benefit of the doubt it is still permissable to carry out abortions in order to safeguard a woman's autonomy.
1	You see, that's the problem: "generally". You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country.	It's hard for me to believe that people in your movement don't know that generally, people's view on a political/ideological issue is a different matter than whether or not they would save their life or help them.
1	Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.	since you asked the question again, ill answer again <snip>stuff about us being in a democratic system</snip> as a christian, if a legal matter is being contested, and you want to oppose it, you are certainly welcome to do so.
0	i think that would probably create more problems than it would solve. how would we know? we don't punish. drunk drivers get off incredibly easy so much of the time. we have the weakest anti-drunk driving laws in the western world and we have the worst problem with drunk driving. coincidence? that's not all that far from what i've said. @joe- this is for a whole other discussion, but i think that the first step in aa is a big part of the reason of its low success rate. that's not too far from what i've said either.	just privatise the road system and let the owners set the rules for drunkeness, it's the only fair way to do it.
0	to be honest with you, i'm mildly amused at best.	you obviously either fail to understand the argument being presented, or you now understand it and don't want to admit to your previous folly.
1	do you actually think that asking worthless questions will help your side? oh wait, obviously you do, that's all you ever ask. why are you trying so hard to deny the fact that conception originates a new organism?  irrelevant  that conception is the beginning of that new organism's life and physical existence? irrelevant that conception is in that respect, the birth of a new organism?  my definition does not allow for this conclusion. why does that fact bother you so much? if you are right, then all words are worthless and meaningless. if you are right every word means every other word.	why are you trying so hard to deny the fact that conception originates a new organism?
1	Yippie doo! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view. And his point of view has (or had) merit. But since then, several feathered dinosaurs (not birds) have been found. It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation. (You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a "point mutation" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation.	Well, here's another quote from Allan Feduucia:"Feathers are unique to birds, and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified."
0	And those pillars will be replaced by something stronger like equality and Justice.	If we allow marriage to be redefined to include same-sex couples, the Twin Pilllars of Morality and Spirituality (which have served as beacons of the American culture since our beginning) will not stand.
0	humans don't just have sex for procreation. humans have sex for pleasure. that explains the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerves underneath the head of the penis.	the fact of the matter is, however, that homosexual relationships, themselves, appear to have no positive evolutionary purpose.
1	hey, archangel, i notice you didn't respond to the points i made - no argument, huh? to quote jyoshu: 'well since you didn't address my points, i'll assume you're done! a simple 'ok, i concede that ... and moving on back to the issues ...' ***jyoshu well, everyone, looks like our ez/ss clone has finally realized his argument was wrong.	plain and simple, you have no idea what your talking about regarding the bible or spiritual topics so i'm wasting my time trying to reason with the likes of you in any case.
1	So AIDS is the fault of "the gays"?emoticonXRolleyes   lol it's been a long time, JP.	While AIDS can be spread through heterosexual sex, I stated that it was homosexual sex that put AIDS over the critical mass needed to perpetuate and spread.
0	No it's not. Perhaps because you don't understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with ID. ID is not science and has no evidence to support it.	I don't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID.
0	YES! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed. With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild (as england did). They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote. Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system.	Does this mean that the found fathers of America realised that they were not to be trusted?
0	you seem to be lost in our jokes, you have to tell people you're joking so they know. and you got the punctuation wrong, in the russian phrase. the only way for it not to sound insane in russian, would be to put it as: '___ _ __. __'. calling someone '__', means things are serious, and you're ready for a fight. if you claim it to be a joke, you're just insane. so i assume that you got the punctuation wrong, and it was your signature.	i didn't say it was making me hungry.
0	I know of at least 3 personally, including my brother. He fought for custody for years and it nearly bankrupted him. He was trying to get his kids away from an ex-wife that would go away with her boyfriend for weekends at a time and leave their 15 year old daughter in charge of threee younger siblings.	How many men who are single fathers and take sole responiblity for thier children because the women refuses to do so will you find if you go looking?
1	What part of the Christian worldview? A part of the Christian worldview says stealing is wrong, so you must mean stealing is good? A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong, so you must mean rape is good? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong, so you must mean sexual immorality is good?	At least from my studying it seems that the Christian worldview is not correct in any way, shape or form.

1	Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, "....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically." you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence.	If grammatically meant "with proper grammar", then there would be no need to say "grammatically correct".
1	Oh spare me the condemnation ya' XXXX-hard. You aren't interested in saving souls. If you were, you would bother to have payed attention to the countless times you have been told that your abrasive, insulting tactics DON'T WORK.   Plus an eternity in hell or an eternity with a terroristic God? I think I will stick with being able to live with myself for even today, let alone an eternity.	And an eternity in hell for unrepentant, Christ-denying sinners is a good thing in your mind?
0	islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage.	as you may or may not know, satan is a fallen angel and islam is his religion which is proven by the hate, murder and death that it was built upon and has lived by since its founding.
1	Oh it applies, but if we were to look at the Bible that way, God wouldn't allow one single bad thing to happen.	If that were true God would make sure there were no such thing as a miscarriage.
0	You lost this debate Skeptic, why drag it back up again? There are plenty of other subjects that we could debate instead. Pick one of them and let's debate again. Alternatively, how about a formal debate on ID in which you never once mention Behe? That'll be a completely different one and worth considering.	...I feel that though the overwhelming number of objections brought up by Clive14 and the later objections by DE, I did not represent the Intelligent Design position as well as I could have, had I spent more time and thought on the debate.
0	A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology).	Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory, I have used an explanation of Darwin's theory from Gould's book, "Full House."
0	Well let's see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages, suddenly there was more support for a Federal Marriage Amendment than ever, Democrats lost more seats in Congress, the minority Democratic leader was defeated after years in office, a protestant presidential candidate carried the Catholic vote against a Catholic candidate, evangelicals in the country were energized, the pro-FMA candidate WON re-election even though his approval rating was 50%, and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it's up in the air again.The more you push you agenda through activist judges, the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment. At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election.	As it becomes legal in more areas, an amendment will be more difficult.
1	So, faith and argument from incredulity. If you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. Then maybe an actual scientist could take over.Major in molecular biology? Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.

0	It hasn't been proven that the Second Amendment is solely about tyrannical governments and not about dealing with violent criminals.	I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about.
0	Because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult. Any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature.	Guilty of the rapes I'm not disputing (don't know anything about those cases), but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed?
0	Pandion has already pointed out that this isn't a theory, it's a mode of wishful thinking. More damagingly, however, if you examine it for more than a moment it doesn't even fulfill the role you give it. You say 'many things in nature make no sense without God', but how do god's origins and nature make sense? Where did he/she/it spring from? All you do by invoking god as an 'explanation' is push the problems one step further back. The god hypothesis may look like an explanation, but it is not.	I, personally, believe in the theory that since many things in nature make no sense without God, he created the universe.
1	Whatever. First you say no one is calling you a hypocrite, than you say people do it, but it just an attack tactic. If you ever get to a mental state where you can entertain the possibility that a critisism of you can be grounded in reality, than go back to my post where I say "This is why..." and give it a read again. Maybe you'll learn somethig. Till then...	Yeah, I have noticed ad hominem tends to be a trend among a few folks here.

1	Interestingly everyone but 'the left' can assimilate what is being said, however, the left is notorious for their ever-present attitude that everyone else is mindless. You don't got no brownie points.....	Sam Walton was a christian, and many christians worked in his first stores and continue to do so, so using your logic Wal-Mart is a christian company "founded on Judeo-Christian precepts" (which you still have failed to list or support in any way).
1	Which you would do by having teachers teach kids that being gay is alright. You would teach those kids, against their parents wishes, that being gay is alright. You would do that after you make it legal WITHOUT A POPULAR VOTE. Seems that you really don't give a rat's XXX about this poor dead kid at all. You just see his corpse and throw him on top of your gay marriage banner. How noble of you.	The solution is for people like you to look past their own "morality" and past their own noses!

0	Jake good try at manipulating scriptures. Jesus is all about family values. The point of thsoe scriptures is that His gospel is above everything else. The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.	According to Jesus in the New Testament, here is hate and family values..."If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

0	Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born. And as I've said, there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption.	As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it.

If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.	BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died.

0	Really? What a surprise! So tell me. If you don't know what it is or how it works, how do you know that you are opposed to it?	I have not studied evolution according to your way of thinking.
1	the same way most people on planet earth dont give a XXXX about american "football"	Americans as a whole don't say soccer sucks; we just don't give a rat's XXX about it.
1	that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!	now the average anti-evolutionist would like it to be just specific functions in which case you could just say novelty (information on how to create new systems).
0	Again, would you please show how this limits anyone's speech in any way? This is just paper work that lobbyists need to fill out, it's not infringing on any rights in any way. You are totally free to buy people to push your agenda, you just need to document that that is what you're doing.	If we are to limit free speech by ANYONE,
0	I see the difference, but that's not what Obama is trying to do. He got us to buy the pig at a firesale and is hoping to make money selling it back to the original farmer or give it to the fieldhands.	If I get the government to steal your pig, give it to me, and then I throw pig droppings at you all year and then keep all the pork, that is fascist economic theory.
1	A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man. And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all.	Now I ask you, what the HELL does it matter what the HELL I called it, as long as you know what it is (or can at least you can look it up, too).
1	see you know, lets all sign a petition to ban the doctor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you know prodigee was right all along!	now prodigee and i may not get along very well but i do think he's right about this.
1	NONONONONONONO! I wasn't talking about you JoeBrummer I was talking about aNaCaLaGoN! Don't worry I try not to pick on people who don't like it!Right Sinjin?	If you want to come debate with the grown ups try be one!
0	you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing	These christians make up their mind that something is in the bible and whatever it says is what it says.
1	wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake.	i don't pretend to know what is behind your movement, but you obviously hate society.
1	whooooosh. emoticonXBye  That was the sound of my point as it went over your head.  How much do you want to but I don't find any?  Go ahead bet me! Are you afraid?	why do you think all of the states used to outlaw sodomy, and where do you think they got that from?
0	So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict? That doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then I don't have much choice in the matter, do I? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If God is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. Deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.Unless of course, God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. But then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me.	The bible also says God knows everything yet to come, so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby.
1	Buy stock in the failing banks? What a great investment. Tell me, where does the money come from?	We need to do the same...without assuming control of the banks.But why should I worry?
1	Let me return the kindness. The correct spelling is ==> especially	Too bad you presume to tell me I'm not welcome in yours, especiallly since it ain't.
0	Although i personally oppose abortion,i agree that two wrongs dont make it right.	Sorry, two wrongs don't make a right.
0	I'm not familiar with the book, so can't comment upon it first hand. However http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too. As I say I haven't read the original so cannot judge the quality of the link I'm supplying, so apologies in advance if it grossly misrepresents Mr Well's case.	Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrongby Jonathan WellsI appologise for not remembering the exact title, but its definately a good read.
0	You know, I heard that from my mom last week. My parents moved to Arkansas when my dad retired a few years back. Mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have. Ironic indeed.	But they had three of the highest divorce rates in 2003, based on figures from the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics.http://www.sunherald.com/mld/thesunh...d/10179154.htm
0	Well it all depends on who is going to determine "right", isn't it? Abortion is not math. There are no finite answers. Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history. I do like Aristotle's take; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable.	Just because people have all sorts of views on the subject does not mean that there isn't a right answer.
1	wow! i didn't know that. thanks! should i read the new york times instead?	i would not be concerned considering the source - newsmax is a notoriously right-wing site that is hardly considered a reliable source.they are about as reliable as the john mccain campaign or fox news(hee hee).
1	Yeah, gassing and murdering 6,000,000 Jews doesn't qualify as suffering very much.   emoticonXRolleyes   I wonder how many slaves were killed by comparison........	however Jews ahve not suffered very much in terms of minorities like other minorities.
0	along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen.	(no slur on librarians, i know some who are fine people, including a wealthy one, just a comparison for the thread) as to mrs. kerry's tax filing extension, that's available to any and all taxpayers.
1	Symbiote seems to have had a large hair across his butt.	If not, then you have to come to the conclusion that God does not exsist... God's only exsistance in the minds of believers just as was the case with believers of different Gods throughout human history.
1	You'd have to drown a few puppies too. Kittens might do, but you might fall a little short.	You mean I could commit fraud, become a child molester, kill a few people, rob a few banks and still be treated as normal as long as I support the ban?emoticonXRolleyesI think you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan.
0	I'm afraid it is you who is wrong. I created you so that you would think you created me to think I created everything, even though I did. It's more of a challenge that way to try to convert people to the one true religion. Since you can see that I won't be able to convert the world (it's due in a week), you can pay $100 dollars to me so I will take you with me to the upper world.	I'm afraid you're wrong, as I created you in my universe, and implanted in you a belief that you were a god.
0	fair enough. i tend to run skeptic. i am surprised that i am a theist. if you were to believe in a god, which would it be?	thus i am not convinced
1	Why not, after all, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy	What a travesty that would be!emoticonXKill terrorists and those who support them.Just kill 'em ALL!
1	No, you at least need a sling shot and ball bearings, lol.	One guy held up three separate banks with a simple knife.
0	And that is different how? I told johnny to write that I'm infallible. Therefore the book that I told johnny to write proves I'm infallible. There is no difference.   You do realize that there are other religions out there? That science is constantly updating?   Your arguments have been nothing more then false dichotomies assuming there are only two choices despite history laughing in your face.	i thought there were only evo or creo to choose from.
1	Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?  Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world.	nice observation, chum, but the real god - the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob - is alive and well and wants to see you when you die.
0	Yes yes, this was all covered in Wells' previous book, Icons of Evolution. It has been refuted numerous times (some even on this forum). See here for a thorough debunking.	Wells also shows how most of the other "evidence" for evolution -- including textbook "icons" such as Peppered Moths, Darwin's Finches, Haeckel's Embryos, and the Tree of Life -- has been exaggerated, distorted .
1	Methinks it's rather obvious that mintaka is JimIrvine because no rational newbie would come here and agree with Irvine's ridiculous and juvenile attacks/assertions out of the box. emoticonXRolleyes	With his cutie not far behind.
1	If we could rub a brass lamp, make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately, I'd agree with you. But since we live in the REAL WORLD, we must become OIL INDEPENDENT while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources.	Promoting renewables is a good thing, but increasing the supply of oil in counter productive in helping renewables to reach the critical mass needed to survive economically.
0	Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made "morals and ethics" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men.	I think that Darwin and Dawkins have made the issue of "morals and ethics" a joke.
0	Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848.	This was because the *dark* forms resting on light tree-trunks were more easily spotted, and thus eaten, by birds.
1	So this singularity that appeared out of no were became a greater singularity which took on perfect balance and form?	Actually, nothing did not explode, a singularity expanded :)
1	two reasons: first, i come from a jewish family, and i've never heard of this before. now, i'll grant that nothing says that i should have, but this is news to me. second, and more importantly, trebor is not the person who made the positive claim; you are. it is your burden of proof. no one here can blame me for questioning your bare assertions given your history with falsehoods. so if he doesn't respond in a mere three hours, you declare victory? how about you call me presumptuous again? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you aren't able to back up your claim. congratulations. try it next time without accusing somebody of being cowardly and misleading.	but i suspect that trebor has asked those with better recollections of the time than he has and they have confirmed for him that what i said is true, which is why he hasn't come back and refuted my response to him.
0	The memo is real, nobody has ever been able to disprove it. Handgun Control Inc. (the people who later became the Brady Campaign) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position. However them simply stating this, is no different than Obama making a statement on national news, and then several months later saying "I never said that" and trying to reverse his position.Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda, the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after.	As the "leak" appears to have happened SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, she may have difficulty catching up with that.
0	Apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the Illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the Constitutions. It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it. The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down. Knowing the State of Illinois, I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners.   The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time.	To think that a common sense measure like this could come out of a senseless place like Illinois.
1	It's Satan, not Satin. And he's your daddy, not ours (John 8:44).	I'm sorry but to me spreading misinformation sounds like something the Devil would do.god is really the Devil.All you Christians are actually the properly of Satin.Way to go Satin!
0	an image is not the original. a photo of you is not you, its an image of you. the image cannot be or replace the original, and isnt intended toregardless of how "perfect" the photocopier is, you cannot cash the "perfect" copy of the check. it may be a perfect replica, to the detail, but it is still only an image. the problem isnt the quality of the copying process, but the fact that the copy itself is just that, a copy, not the original	Or are you saying that God has a big imperfect copy machine that he jumps into and out pops an imperfect copy.My thought was that God was the direct agent of creation (without the use of intervening mechanical devices), and being a perfect Being incapable creating imperfection (for then He would not be God), all of His creation would be as perfect as He is.So does this perfect God have a spine that is a plethora of engineering disasters?
0	are you trying to say that people of faith cannot tell the difference between myth and reality? i'm actually confused by this sentence.	*edited  cthulhu, unfortunately we couldn't even prove one of them wrong because they are faith based.
1	Yes, some people are jumping ship, which is a crying shame. STICK TO YOUR GUNS MEN! WE'RE WINNING!	It seems that the creationists are beginning to change there views.evolution can be explained by science but creation relys on myth, superstition and hope, but few people are now suggesting that the two theories can be explained together, god started everything then evolution took over.Its like the creationist is trying to put one over the evolutionist by suggesting that god created evolution.But in reality i think a person who believes in creation is coming to terms that the creation theory is a bit far fetched and the evolution theory makes more sense, but due to religious conditioning still continue to grasp on the creation theory.Which really means the bible would be disregarded as a source of information.
1	And the funeral dirge of the Left and comparisons to Nazi Germany and/or the collapse of the Roman Empire will begin in 3....2.....	The proceedings went very smooth, except for the obligatory parade of left-wing special interest groups.
0	assumption of 'millions'. they must of because how else can we account for the species today ? got any support for this ? i can prove the antidiluvians knew about and used pi. if man began as an ape/animal then how do you explain the fact that pi was not discovered until thousands of years later ? ray m.	so you are saying that genesis is a scientific fact.

"When you go to war against your enemies...suppose you see a beautiful woman whom you desire...you shall take her..and she shall marry you."
1	i'm surprised that so many people got their knickers in a knot over the ramblings of pat robinson. emoticonxwow	actually, they were mostly hung by their puritan accusers.
1	You are so FUN. Its amazing to hear you say this considering how much you applaud a law that pretty much allows this in Arizona.	Assuming people are guilty and treating them as such, until such time that they can prove that they're actually innocent, just isn't the way to do things.
1	So I take it you don't accept my challenge on the basis that it is impossible? Why is it impossible? Or better yet, why don't we al just evolve into perfect, anti-sinning creatures with 500 IQ points a piece?	And even if a test subject thinks it has won the game and exhibits no guilt - there is always the mythical original and heritable sin to fall back on.
0	did you not say, 'these people need to be stopped?' or was that still part of the article? if that was you, then that is a viewpoint that, if implemented, will directly influence public policy. you say you do not want to make this country a theocracy, right? well, do you want to make it/keep it a non-theocracy? if so, you are trying to extend/keep an ideology imposed through government. i'm not saying that is bad; i am only saying it is what it is.	where do you get that from?
0	and how do you know this......oh I see...you said "I think"....but you don't really "know" what most Americans favor or don't favor...you just "think"	I think most Americans are not against Civil Unions for gays so this is no big deal, besides I think Vermont already has approved Civil Unions.....
0	No one wants to take your "marriage" away Matt. It's a free country--no one's going to block your way to any chapel that will marry you. Do your gay thing. But let marriage be marriage--it's a different matter. People just want to keep you from tampering with the institution of marriage.	There is nothing the conservatives, republicans, or chistonazis can do to stop or take this license from us.
0	Exactly. It is their fault, but they can do what they choose. It is punishment and you know it, and it is not your job to make sure no "irresponsible" pregnant woman goes unpunished.	The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it.
0	And yet, for most pro-choice folk on these forums, this question really is meaningless. For, even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights, they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable. Even you believe this Shooter.	Most pro-choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts, or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights.
1	Good observation! He is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content. He is one of the more fellatious people I know and you won't find him taking notice of the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land either.	So the basis for your articles thesis is fallacious in expecting armed people to somehow become extensions of law enforcement in order to justify being armed.Therefore, the only rational response to your premise is to encourage more law abiding people to be armed and trained so as to outnumber the armed criminals so they will have no unarmed citizens to victimize.
0	Actually, I reported the real results of a study. Regular church attendees are twice as likely to vote Republican...etc., the conclusion was, however, meant to be a joke. Most got it, you didn't. emoticonXRolleyes	For your info just a many Democrat go to church as well so whats that suppose to mean too.
0	hmmmm..., unwanted competition...., i guess you are all on that database then ;)	also, even if your computer idea worked and was a reality, you just told a whole bunch of people about it, so now you have unwanted competition.
1	doh, you used the 'l' word. how dare ye! (tsk, tsk) :p don't you know? you can't use the term 'lifestyle,' you have to use the description of lifestyle instead. that usually works much better. gotta know the rules to talk with the gay rights folk here, don't ya know? lol see, if you use the word, they can't stay on topic and so then your use of the 'l' word becomes the topic. it's just too damn distracting for 'em.	for those that don't know what the word 'lifestyle' means i have taken the liberty to post it for you below: the habits, attitudes, tastes, moral standards, economic level, etc., that together constitute the mode of living of an individual or group.
0	Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.	all of the british papers keep going on about how bad it is, how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets, how guns are being imported into britain and resold through underground channels, how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage, etc.
1	Because there couldn't possibly be any undetected illegal gun trafficking, could there be?	Requiring a background check for handgun sales byprivate sellers and licensed gun dealers helps reduceillegal gun trafficking within a state.Pick the percentage.
0	Think about this? Do you support abolishing the Senate? In the Senate, a vote from Rhode Island is worth more than a vote from California.Also, the US is not a democracy. It is a republic. You are guaranteed an equal say in the House of Representatives.	With the electoral college system a vote in ________ is worth more or less than a vote in ___________.
1	So it's your contention that hundreds of thousands of firearms stolen from residences annually is just par for the course?	:) Watch the doorknobs on the way out and all that stuff.
1	Um, of course, it was too much to expect murderers to shell out for burying their victims. I keep forgetting I'm in Dick Cheney's America.	It's nice, but if you can't afford it, why bankroll a cremation or burial?
1	Nah, he has been TRAINED to recognize demonic possession as part of his B.A.	You can't cast out what is not there doofus.. you should know better.
0	I think an open mind is the best thing to have when it comes to theories. I think there is some truth in everything.	As trebor has said, "creation science" is an attempt to find scientific sounding reasons that can be used to justify the conclusions that have already been reached and that are not subject to change.
1	Yea, at least on earth you get some relief, you die eventually.	The hell that is earth is not quite the same hell that people get threatened with.
1	You can try and deny the facts all you like. Here they are from the CDC for 2003, go spin them.	Why do suppose exaggeration and embellishment or an aversion to facts is necessary for some people who consider themselves pro life or at least anti choice?
0	Well, as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint. Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this: "My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject".Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it.	This guy has been debating me for almost a year now...I thought I would share one of his post with you.

0	The reported killings in European countries have rivaled the levels of Columbine. Quite a feat for a country with strict gun control laws.

0	Right on! A real man supports those he loves, through thick and thin. He doesn't try and control the things he can't either.In the end, it's not a man's decision. It is not his body, therefore, he has no right to make the ultimate decision. He can only express his view. That's about it. (I'm pretty sure it's not any easier for her to decide). So cudos to those men.	A "real man" helps those who he loves, whether he likes what they did.
1	Oh please... You just refuse to acknowledge anything of a victory for LGBT people.	The people didn't vote, so the winning streak still stands.Besides, the majority on that one are morally-challenged, spiritually-stunted imbeciles.
1	Very Interesting! After only 33 posts Mintaka already has the political and gun advocacy priorities of individual members here down pat; or should I say the resurrected antonia, our resident National socialist healthcare freak does and couldn't help but expose her personal insights where none should exist for this alleged newbie.	How ironic you would even care since (1) you've opposed saving the lives of 101,000 of your fellow Americans who died this past year because of inadequate care, and (2) you think people should defend themselves with their own guns and stop burdening taxpayers with police departments.Oh and do take notice of the costly tasteless suit who came downstairs from the corporate palaces to arrogantly stand next to the underpaid cop in N.Y.C., and as if he owned the city's police forces.Anyone know that Costly Tasteless Suit's name?
0	SNIPThis opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an "assault weapons ban" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier.	But as it turns out, there appears to be little basis for the number....
0	Old news. There have been accusations of similar stories for years.	With that established, I would be interested in your comments.
0	YOU LIAR.You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said "FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS" in North Carolina 1 year later.And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?	From the end of my narration setting up Heston's speech in Denver, with my words, "a big pro-gun rally," every word out of Charlton Heston's mouth was uttered right there in Denver, just 10 days after the Columbine tragedy.
0	dear chloe, do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion? that is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote, embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of human beings. if one kills a human being, one is guilty of murder.	silly chloe...how can a part of the womens body other than her own mouth cry?
1	Yet another non-response. (We're not going to have to start counting these, are we?) It fails to address your dilemma of the "just are" theories.	Some theories are philosophical, and some are not.

1	Yes...I think I would agree with you. That's what happens when you have superstition coupled with self-imposed ignorance I suppose. It's a shame!	The poorest part of America is the bible belt.Along with that, infant mortality rates approaching some third world countries plus all the stuff we have already talked about makes me believe that something is wrong there and it has to do with the bible.
1	Did you slip in it AGAIN? Were you led astray by a passage from Heller you thought you could use to legitimize gun control, your wet dream?I submit from many past rulings of the courts that little statement is in error.	The case is not novel, and my sense is that the defense is generally recognized: Just as what would otherwise be the crime of murder, attempted murder, battery, and the like might be justified if done in defense against an imminent threat, so a felon’s taking possession of a gun is justified if done in defense against an imminent threat.
1	the aussies are banning publications and films of women with small breasts. if you think that mens mags like nuts are pornographic you are a little sad..dont mix with other men much..mother told you sex was dirty? oh dear the porn expert is insinuating that i must be getting my rocks off..see above:) graphic depictions of rape are freely available in videos and so are not 'rare'. expert on slasher films with 'teenage trollops getting killed...see above:)	my point is that graphic depictions of rape are rare in film.
1	Isn't that exactly what I said! Clearly we have an issue of a probably overweight white man who is without a doubt racist (because if we know anything it is that every white male that has short hair is a racist) coming down on a black woman!   You nailed it again MA! Props to you for uncovering this mystery.	Oooh yes, and I'm sure a policeman would just as easily have treated a 7 month pregnant white woman in the Connecticut burbs the same way.
1	I don't really give a flying hippo's arse what you think - your posts here and on the other forums are repugnant, and as of now, you are being put on ignore (to take a page from Steeeeve).	Too bad that the truth is now something to be emoticonXCensored emoticonXDonnoAs for trivializing, I don't think that my comments about abortion trivialized anything.
1	hmm so all you guys have achieved is make a bad situation in iraq infinitely worse and you ask the reasons why the whole world hate you? go to iraq and ask the people there what do they think of you and take the whole class with you including the teacher. so how would you reign in the militias, what is your method the world would probably not approve of?	we certainly could reign all of the militias in if we really wanted to, but the world would probably not approve of the method.
0	And depending on what human is "finding the answers" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings.	Understanding these natural phenomena as secondary causes, places God above them where increased ability to explain how they occur not only does not "decrease" God, but adds wonder to His creation."
1	Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does. Indeed, we'd probably be the darlings of the GOP. Unfortunately for your delusion, gays are no more or less wealthy on average than anyone else.	One of the wealthiest segments of our population are gays.
1	that's probably being saved for the next round of national election fodder. maybe something on the order of occupying all the me, making it a christian democracy while we use their oil for their own good? with every family owning their own home, two cars and a boat. wait, they've used that promise and it failed. not to worry, i'm sure they'll come up with something that'll keep the sheep headed towards the cliff.	with myself being one of the american sheep here, ( an alert one tho, ) i was hoping to see someone post a big secret, saying that our govt has a secret fuel source all ready to go , but were just holding out on it, until the oil was almost gone, and everyone had gotten all of their riches from the fossil fuel.
1	Watch out, Jim. She believes that the only good man is a neutered man. emoticonXIc	I was just gettin' ready to send you a picture of my truck!
0	Actually, this (if what that article is true, which I am not quite sure) is a healthy part of science. Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare. Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed. Man's theories change everyday, while God's word has remained the same.	For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down.

1	...? Either you've misread what I said, twisted what I said, or you're just stupid.	They all believe in a god but hope there isn't?
1	Yup. Give me an example of a true inaccuracy, instead of working to poke fun. Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures. Are you scared because you see the "ancients" commenting on subjects you thought science had "discovered" since the "enlightenment"? Man, how arrogant can you get? You remind me of the Pharasees. Arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend. Either explain how the Bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above, or don't bother posting.	I guess you spend a lot of money on those 1-900 psychics too.
0	There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.	The coelacanth, according to fossil records, and according to evolutionists, allegedly went extinct millions and millions of years ago.Until they were found alive.Coelacanth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaAs if this should be any surprise.

0	And religion is what caused the Crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. Many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called "in the name of atheism".	This is what has caused such events as the Columbine Highschool shootings.

0	Because some restrictions that might pass constitutional muster, don't amount to an outright ban. How would impossibility ever be considered constitutional?	The Breyer-Sotomayor-Ginsburg dissent questioned why some restrictions would be acceptable but not the Chicago handgun ban:
0	First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition.	If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot.
0	Agreed that they are still the same species, much like the "13 species" of Darwin's Finches, and I have no problem with evolution in that respect. I can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time. But I still don't see where evolution, in that sense of the term, can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest, or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland.	If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other.
0	freedom dearie are you serious about pepper spray? just yesterday i presented a story where a taser and bean bag rounds from a shotgun did literally nothing against a 68 year old with a bad heart condition. what can a cheap chemical agent do against an adrenaline charged youth who's got more vitality and health on his side than a senior citizen in new york?	i am not against gun rights, or for the mad-regulators of the left; but if i were zimmerman right now (assuming he is telling the truth) i would be kicking myself now until the day i die for not carrying pepper spray and trying that first.

Anyone and everyone who is fed up with Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer, the liar Chris Dodd, the incompetent Harry Reid, carnal left-wing hedonism, people who erringly bow down to obese Buddha-like statues that can't hear and can't talk or reason; pseudo-Christians like Barack Obama and his followers who forgot to read Psalm 139:13 and Jeremiah 1:5, so they push infanticide/abortion; trillion-dollar budget-busting socialists who put America in incredible debt because they want their feel-good Utopia to come to pass; left-wing politicians who will run their mouths about Iran building a nuclear weapon but are too dumb and gutless to do anything about it; and anyone who looks or thinks like Barney Franks.
0	No no; again, you don't get it. He's only struggling because of people like you who deny the obvious. Rather than listen to what Majerus says about Majerus's project, you're listening to Mr. Mistaken Coyne and the author of the the Science article, which doesn't say what you think it says.	... and is still struggling ... to draw any kind of scientific conclusion, even one drawn upon contrived and artificial conditions.
1	since you are so oblivious to the truth, and probably flunked science a couple of times: http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/essays/courtenay1.htm http://newton.nap.edu/html/creationism/evidence.html http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/the%20...g%20theory.htm http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm fact listen: [ fkt ] n.  knowledge or information based on real occurrences: an account based on fact; a blur of fact and fancy.  a. something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed: genetic engineering is now a fact. that chaucer was a real person is an undisputed fact. see above. http://www.carm.org/abortion/embryo.htm a piece of my hair is of the homo sapein species too. does that mean my hair is a person? perhaps you need to get your 'facts' straight.	a fact can just mean 'a truth that exists' or it can be a 'something known to exist'....so, whatever.
1	Two answers: they were either of the ant kind and didn't eat wood until they underwent hyperevolution after the landing of the ark, or they were placed in a suspended state of hibernation by 'Awlmighty Gawd' (only two - one male and one female, in spite of the fact that termites don't actually propagate that way). It is, after all, the word of Gawd, as revealed in the wholly babble.	And what did Noah do about the termites?
0	A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one.	Then banning same-sex marrige would be wrong, and there would be no reason for it.
1	He wasn't trying to. Shooterandproud may be an unreasonable gun nut, but he accepts evolution.	Despite your bull in a china shop rampage through the fields of bioogy, cosmology and paleo, you have not yet given any evidence of a 6000 year old earth, god made in 6 days.
0	Well, it depends on your definition of retarded I guess. The standards to get a drivers license are really not that high. Think of how dumb the average person is, and realize that 50% of people are dumber than that. Kinda makes you cringe.   And you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident? Well, perhaps the fact that I am a concientious, defensive, and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road. Maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me, I should just throw my hands in the air and scream "take the wheel jesus!" I am sure some magical being will fly down from heaven and save me from crashing. Yeah...sure.	They depend on level-headed, indiscriminate folks like you and I to do that...and most everything else for that matter.
0	Oh, there's no hypocrisy involved, just you being your usual self and not even looking at the actual information (or, more likely, looking at the information and then deliberately playing dumb).	I just wanted to point out the obvious hypocrisy of everything your side represents, and nothing more.

0	Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't "on the grounds," although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property. It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district. The children go to the seminary on released-time, which has been found to be constitutional (although I don't see how).Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are:McCollum v. Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306)McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that "accommodating" religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not.	I live in Utah and every public school has a building on the grounds called the seminary.

0	And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. That's not what a Democracy is about, at least not our Democracy.	If minorities' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives, then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system.

0	The fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method. There is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being, and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact, yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god. Mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others I have spoke with on this subject. I do believe in scientific method, but I also have faith that god is out there.	Scientific facts keep changing, because they keep building on what is proven.

0	How long has the boyfriend been 16? Is he closer to 15 or 17?How long has nocturnal09 been 14? Is she closer to 13 or 15?If nocturnal09 will be 15 in a couple of days or so and the boyfriend just turned 16 about a month ago, then the 14 vs 16 thing isn't really the biggest deal. Depending on when their b-days fall, they could both be in the same graduating class. He could have been born in May 1990 while she was born in July 1991. Therefor, he is 16 but she will still be 14 for at least another half of a month. Now, none of this information was given. All I'm saying is that the 2 year gap (until more info is given there) can not be considered the biggest problem.	Similarly, if you're boyfriend is happy to have sex with someone 2 years younger than he is (which is a pretty significant age gap at that age)...
1	you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise.	If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens.

As a matter of fact, it seems that it is difficult for most politicians to be elcted in the state without being supportive of marriage equality.	said it was alright did make it alright for the rest of the country.2 liberal states didn't push the rest of the country to follow like sheep to a slaughter.
1	Wow Archie, way to suck the fun out of something. Let me use your words here:	Any powers you attribute to the fictional character Superman, you can accurately attribute to Jesus and you wont find him wanting.
1	you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.	then you keep them on your government plantation so they can vote to keep you in power.

1	So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.	I believed and hoped in the possibility.It was Jesus, the living son of God.. he had feet, hands, legs - he had a body yes.I never looked at his face, but i knew who it was - for one thing nobody walks around in robes anywhere near where I live.
0	Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of "arms" include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case.	They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals, but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms.
0	And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people.

0	what does that have to do with the issue being discussed? unless you're suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing. is that the point you're trying to make? beside, by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians, you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is. so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all?	hey archie, have you watched for the bible tells me so yet?
0	Sucide? Isn't that a mental health issue? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person, does that cure depression?   If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide.   If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide.	those who have firearms in their homes are more likely to die of murder and are more likely to die from suicide.
0	i'm sorry, but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded. i can see (remotely) how abortion might be considered anti-woman (although it is of course anti-life before being anything else), but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women's suffrage, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, etc.? by the way, do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion? i am catholic, and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned (except abortion, because it has nothing to do with women's rights) are viewed positively by the catholic church, or ever have been. please explain with details.	we were making some social progress, but that seems to be slowing in several states as our government imposed siege mentality rolls out the same old insecurities.
0	oh yes we can. invoking god is not an explanation for ultimate origins, it's the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declaring further application of the question off limits. simply declaring that god's origin doesn't need explaining does not make that so.	you see, this could go on for a while, because the next logical question is 'where did that stuff come from' and so on.
0	And here our Government recognizes:  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people	That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law.

0	What issues? You drivel on about breasts forming on lizards (even though the most primitive milk secretors we have today don't have anatomically distinct mammary glands, and the earliest mammals evolved from reptiles not remotely like lizards), then triumphantly crown your straw man with what you seem to think is a knock-down point about nerve connections.Yes, SS, the most primitive milk-secreting structures we know are modified sweat glands; your incredulity does not alter that fact one iota. And guess what? Sweat glands have nerve connections to the hypothalamus...	ssues I raised in my OP regarding the initial formation of breasts.
0	The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the "quality of life" test.	A position of pro-choice is pro-life because the lives and quality of life of women are valued.

1	then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? silly, i 'd say! humans are part of the animal kingdom. mammals if i remember from biology. are you not an animal? if not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon.	for me the reason i don't 'give it credit' is that it's irrelevant--i don't see how it matter either way way if sexual 'orientation' is natural or not.
0	Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said "You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term." I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted.	Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for "choice" remains consistent.Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children?
0	Well he has further political aspirations..........The 9th circuit in Sodom (SF) is always making law instead of interpreting it........That is why they are over ruled so often.......	He doesn't need to worry about votes for a long time.Judges are supposed to rule on the Constitutionality of laws when asked to do so.
0	He had ALREADY MADE the animals. "now the Lord God HAD FORMED..." not "now the Lord God formed..." See the difference? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam. He made the animals before Adam.	He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.
1	i'm surprised no one has unearthed some stickman figures and announced that the drawings of jesus have been discovered, as recorded in john 8:7, where he's doodling on the ground while some poor young woman is about to get pelted with rocks. what a pilgrimage that would make...	maybe he'll get more attention, and provide a good set of evidence, because it is the people on the fringe that are needed to shift the paradiam.. (then they are visionary, rather than on the fringe).
1	When I want the opinion of a spiritually-dead nincompoop I'll call you.	The bible contradicts itself.On more reason why only fools live by it.Grow up and stop hiding behind god you cry baby.
0	Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation, this shows:1) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die. A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood.	For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to jmake atonement for yourselves at the alter; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.
1	And what does he mean by that? You apparently don't have a clue. Tell me, do you have any idea what "secondary cause" is?	He finishes the book with "What kind of God do I believe in?
1	Well, I guess you can refuse to see something that's pretty obvious. It's up to you.	You are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is.
1	don't you insult african americans!  i have posted a number of times links and comments by prominant black leaders who infact do support gay marriage. when will you stop your 'don't insult african americans' lies when you know all too well just how wrong you actually are?  oh that's right...never, because you just don't care what anyone thinks if it at all differs from your opinion.  weren't you spanked enough in the 'banned people' forum?	michele, that is a red herring and you know it.........don't insult african americans fight for rights with gay marriage.......
1	Brave words. Next they'll be limiting free speech. Oh wait. Done that already.	What happens to one Right our Founders called Inalienable, and our courts call a First Right a Fundamental Right, can and someday will happen to all of them!
0	Actually, the more educated a person is, the less likely he is to be a creationist. Creationists tend to be semi-literate (poorly educated), rural, poor, and female.	People educated in the 40's and 50's when higher education was less common) or a very small percentage of Christians.
1	Well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.   Careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. Not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb!   You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.   So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.   Thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. Kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and MOST creationists use the KINDS thing as a support for their arguments.	the big bang chemical evolution: the origin of higher elements from hydrogen stellar and planetary evolution: origin of stars and planets organic evolution: the origin of life macro-evolution: changing from one kind of animal into another there is a sixth evolutionary theory, but it has been proved in a controlled environment, and it is called micro-evolution (variations within kinds)
1	78.4 years? Well excuse me but I intend to live much longer than that. I was thinking about 112.7 years. Yeah. That's about right.	Which, in my opinion is a far better life than: "I'm born of chance, I didn't ask to be here, I serve no purpose, so I might as well live egocentrically for the next 78.4 years until my life ends."
0	And what did I say?   I quoted the title of the video, said "Enjoy" and labeled the link "link"  So how is saying "enjoy" and "link" which were MY words mockery? The only thing that suggests otherwise is the VIDEO's Title, which I did not create.	I quoted YOU because of what YOU said.
0	With all the debt Obama has generated for our nation, he deserves to be filibustered into the ground. For too long the democrats had absolute power and ran amok and unchecked, answering to absolutely nobody and ignoring the will and the voice of the people.	Over 300 pieces of legislation have yet to be voted on and nearly double that in the senate that have already passed the house...Yeah don't try to hide behind that smokescreen...
1	<Flush>  Your own source said there's a cliff a mile and a half away, and I'm the liar? Go find it and jump off it, you flaming, incompetent, scatter-brained, dishonest cretin.	next then you know, you will quote from the bible to make you feel better, but it won't stop you from being a loser.
1	Because of massive cultural differences. You might as well be asking "if both Americans and British people speak basic english, why do British people refer to apartments as flats?"	If Britain has four times the violent crime rate of the US then why do a lot less murdered bodies per 100,000 turn up there?
1	I actually agree. Make it legal and sign away your rights. However - there are plenty of fathers who opt....... "Deadbeat Dad" is practically a profession.	I don't think any man should ever be legally required to pay child support.

0	yeah! its a benefit to be able to do a thing like that. i'm amazed that we've come so far in technology and science, but i think there is a line of what we can offer people. its not like they're gonna chose whether they want to have an egg or a bagel for breakfast.	i agree, it is we that it is ridicules that we have gotten so into controlling stuff that now we even have a way to control natural courses, but i guess like i said before if it is to stop your child from suffering a sickness then i guess that is okay (still bad) but better than just being a complete control freak, or being selfish
0	Of course the bolshevik revolution was doomed from the start as Russia was not indsutrialised and the revolution was imposed by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat (not that there was a proletariat in Russia at the time).	1989, the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down, along with Soviet Ideology.Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it.
0	Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes.	regardless, we have yet to see any evolution of new body parts or its so called "steps" if evolutionists want to suggest that a few decades is too little time
0	The 'teachings' either have no substance, or are certainly not original. Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God, and why this figure commands worship and obeisance.	Instead of using your mind and energies to disprove the bible you should use all your power to to learn how to obey the teachings of the Son of God and mature emotionally and in wisdom.
0	Well, I personally agree that I 'spanked' marc9000 (http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6348). But we'll have to leave it to the judges to make the formal decision.	I'd congratulate you on your win DamEtel, but I'm more impressed with your patience.
0	Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.	Pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not have been accomplished in any other way, is not "raising science on a pedestal"- it's merely reciting the obvious.
1	I don't recall seeing anyone who's for gay marriage come out truly in favor of the idea here that I recall. Can you? Naw, didn't think so. emoticonXSmilie	I think that's exactly why the anti-gay marriage crowd would never go for that idea.
1	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.	I'm sorry if you want to talk past that, and say I disgust you.
0	You blame others for your failure to understand the basics.	Over the years these “educated” people through the media as journalist and movie/television writers began sharing their preliminary understanding of evolution as indisputable fact.
0	This is poor example. Focusing on saving lives over burying the dead doesn't do anything to trump personal autonomy.	If you say there is no such thing as a hierarchy of rights, or if you say the right to personal autonomy trumps the right to life, I point you to observe the situation in New Orleans.

0	Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce.	I'm against gay marriage and have been happily married for 31 years, thereby disproving your BS.
1	i love it when you bash people for stating opinions and no facts when you turn around and the same thing...i take it you have proof of a lie (keep in mind that lying is not the same as being wrong). as for hagel...i will assume he is actually in iraq right now and wrote that. give me a break emoticonxrolleyes	but then the bush people never saw a lie that they couldn't embrace.
1	The first Christians were Jews. Anyone who claims to be a Christian but hates Jews is a XXXXX. An anti-Semetic Christian is like an oxymoron term. And an Aryan is supposed to be someone with blue-eyes, brown-hair, and light-skin. You don't have to believe in 'Aryanism' to be Aryan, and the mortal enemies of Aryans are not Jews. 'Aryans' may hate Jews, but most Jews aren't bigoted. By the way, Hitler did not like just Jews but others he considered 'inferior' to the 'superior' 'Aryan race.'   Do some actual research instead of pulling XXXX out of the air to conform to your screwed up opinions.	aryan was more than, as you put it, "just white"... and as a religion, the mortal enemy of the aryans are jews... you had to be a christian and hitler hated catholics... guess PROTESTANT is the only one left.
0	i'm pro-choice because when i get pregnant, i want to chose whether or not i will abort it. i am not pro-abortion because i don't want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro-life, because i don't want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-abortion, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all have abortions'' you on the other hand go on and say ''hey let's give all fetuses life'' that's what makes you pro-life. i don't want abortion. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal. don't change the title, i just want people to know that we are called pro-choicers.	if it means this much to you i will change the debate title.
1	So your answer to the question then is "Nothing", Marc?	Well let's see, from your "EvC Forum" link;You gather information from other forums, then use it as bait on yet another forum?
1	if homosexuals don't think, how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators? the fact is, the more homosexuality there is, the less abortions. if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man-wife would never abort once. are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas?	by the way you forgot to mention: think, behave morally, and have concern for the future.
0	I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!	I don't think the lightning strike will be proven it is merely plausibe.
0	True, but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it. I know many christians who believe in god, and jesus etc, but think the bible is completely false, and is only a book of fables. Thats what i was trying to imply.	Do the Christians that you know that believe in evolution, believe that there was no first man named Adam, or that there was no Genesis flood?
0	dear noob, i chose the anthem as a song which describes me. however since i am reforming this site into a more democratic community i shall make a debate seeking for a new one.	why do we have such a rubbish anthem for this site?
1	i am very impressed with your ability to copy and paste links. now what this proves about what you know about it is still unproven. unless you are the one in the videos giving the lectures...and he looks like he has been studying this longer then 'almost a decade'. nice try though. what proof can you give that is pertinent to the debate about how that disproves an eternal being? also you may want to get with some of the other atheists on the site because they were pushing the eternal universe and big bounce theories as explanations in other debates. you all should get your scientific consensus on the same page.	that just proves you can use the search function in youtube.
1	Are you sure? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida. His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida. If he is retired, he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs. Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time. Somehow 2 tours turned into 4, midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor.   All in all, VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying, lack of education and reading comphrension problems.	He probably still thinks that the US won the war.
0	i'm not surprised you would say this. it is the statement of a person who would want power and control over a woman's womb, which, btw, inoygdb.	i'd argue that the woman wants to control who lives or dies.
1	Yeah, right, JO, socialist countries are Eden Mecca's all over the world today. No matter how many times they fail, its proponents just need another chance.	I think all Americans should be aware of just what a blight socialism is on the rest of the world so that we don't fall into that same lazy mindset.

0	And if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black Americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well. I can't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open...it has to be expected. People have strong feelings about abortion rights (just like racism) and it is naive to think something like this wasn't going to happen.	I think it might show the true character of some people...
0	Sounds like the Brady Law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns.	A study by The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence showed that, since it's enactment, the Brady Law background check kept handguns out of the hands of over 312,000 prohibited purchasers - including 113 felons a day.http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/r...h/bradyred.asp
1	So? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman's uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds.	“However the Bible does say "I create you before I placed you in the womb"...this would imply that God created you before you are even conceived.”
0	demon, that was quick were you right there? no resentment in my heart friend. i try to translate an expression from hungarian (again i guess that will be poor but i try anyway) 'friendship remains' (or 'unchanged' may be the better word?)  now here is what you asked:  that is a very good question demon, but i would put one more word there 'who'. no insult intended.	i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of.
0	Well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue.	According to the Old Testament, Sodom and Gammorah were destroyed because the rich oppressed the poor (which is nearly an essential part of Capitalism), not because of homosexuality.
0	that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about.	this is what i support.
1	Ok if we can not use guns. Can we use baseball bats? Is that OK with you?	So, if anyone actually takes you up on your offer, and expresses and idea, then, they better watch out if it doesn't agree with yours!That makes sense.
0	And I'm going to correct you again. The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view. More than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations.	True, but as Lurch corrected me before: It is the theory of evolution.
0	Those abortions that are perpetrated as "birth control" should be outlawed.	It is for this reason that "convenience abortions" are technically illegal here in the UK, but they occur anyway.
1	lol. says the one who did not even bother to open the specific post link.  huh. again, you don't care about evidence. i gave it to you and you said i never did despite the link to the specific post right there.  liar you call me? well, i guess it takes one to know one.  questionable. all that the author did was state that the evidence rejects yec. he does not argue for another form of creationism.  please stop trying to argue there is only one form of creationism.  my god you are dishonest. still avoiding why arch would replace yec with christanity eh?  apparently you think interchangeability means that the words mean two different things despite being used interchangeably as the same.	actually if you read the link you posted, you will see that the author is not just a christian who is neutral on yec, but he tends to favor creationism.
1	Oh thats not politically kerect and secially wif the chosen one doing the world apology toure I don't see that going down.   Well lay a few on us sin baby. Give us the deal.	Maybe escorts aren't the way to go.
1	A woman's right to choose to keep her legs together is not in any way abridged by this bill. Ho, ho,f***ing ho.	Another great irony is now a mostly male Democratic leadership that thinks taking away women's right to choose is a Christmas gift or bonus to the American people, of whom over 50% are women.
0	whether there's liberal parties in other countries is beside the point. there is no national 'liberal party' in the usa. if nato was suggesting the ny one, i hardly can be held responsible for not knowing 'their message'. i couldn't care less what it might be.  she said as much. let's see what happens next, shall we? i have a feeling she'll be amending the policy shortly.	i was referring to your outright statement that there was 'no liberal party' when indeed there is one almost in every country.

1	You mean to tell me that you would deny a woman's right to her own body for a zygote, yet you have no problem murdering real human beings? Sounds like a conservative to me...	so thats quite contradictory to me... you would allow a law that killls millions of innocent babies a year and get rid of a law that rightly carries out the law... wierd sounds like a liberal to me.
1	So what are you proposing? Death panels? Do you think we should euthanase the elderly or should we simply stop their social security payments and healthcare?	We don't have the funds for Medicare, Medicaide or Social Security either.But, why am I even hopeful that you will take any of that into consideration.
0	Right. And that is the reason for peer review. Creationists don't subject their ramblings to peer review. That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists. Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation.	It is clear that scientists can affect their experiments and observations, even in spite of their best efforts.
0	Because you know the peer review process is biased. Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read. The scientific community's problems are just that big.	Why do I think they are popular books, and not peer reviewed scientific articles?
1	not to me, but let's not quibble about things we can't change. let's talk about something that we can change...for a change. we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that's written. how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in 'special' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals won't bounce us off the walls.	you could go there but it won't change the fact i don't agree with your ideas of what is says.
1	...but you are just fine with marijuana smoke huh?I am working on the assumption that you run home to tell mommie or you run to find your teacher and report it immediately. Midgets like you got to have some backup.How and why do you always change the subject? Can't take the heat? Do you ever read headers?You got a mouth on you as big as grand canyon.	I am working here on the assumption that you are not a smoker: how do like it when someone blows tobacco smoke in your face?
1	so the old man was doing something criminal by carrying a firearm for self defence? the bar***d! how can you do such a thing, breaking the law like that, or maybe if the criminal who beat him up was the one who actually deserved to be charged, or better shot. so you think that this man who was following the law (texas case) deserved to go to jail for defending his property and anybody else who may have been hurt, killed as a result of their next crime? are you actually insane? have you lost your marbles? what is wrong with you?	in other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law.
0	Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.	But the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than
0	This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.	[*]43% of women will have had at least one abortion by the time they are 45 years old.

0	Right so...1) God will kill you before he gives you a chance to repent? Thus sending you straight to hell. I like that!2) God seems to make life unfair for most everyone. Hey, even in America. Consider in America, and extrememly religious state, you still have the highest homocide rates out of ALL the western countries. (I'm pretty sure of this.)3) Left behind? So, wait. The riegtous go the heaven, and everyone else remains leading a normal, religion free life on earth? Hmmm...4) Hebrews?5) Can it help? The gospels tell a story about a carpenter who lived 2000 years ago, and may or may not have been the son of god. Yeah, I can see how that can help. Why can't I worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster?	yah it sucks that a God would kill you for not believing in him but who said life was fair?

1	Now settle down charlie, and try to think rationally, just for a second. Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does? I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's.	And secondly, it's a bit rich for them to call it murder when a blastocyst can turn into a tumour.
0	i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!	my point is that many people who have fought for human rights claim religion as part of their inspiration, and with your all-or-nothing approach, i can only assume you'd still condemn religion even if gets more and more gay friendly.
1	i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?	why do the 'loving' christians always threaten eternal torment when you ask them for information?

0	And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years. The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s.

0	I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.	That will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but can't prevent crime from occurring as it's happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings.You anti-second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men.
1	Superglue! How you gonna make the DNA?  This is all facinating but it doesn't have a thing to do with information theory.  Copying DnA to do reasearch is a neat trick and quite useful.  Is there a point to this?	please explain how you would turn 3.5kg of oxygen, silicon, aluminum and a few other elements of your choice into a 3.5kg rock.
0	Well do you mean Texas or Texans? Because Texas holds the record for execusions in the US. Not something I'd be proud of.	So what else is new?
0	Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief.	'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.
1	not really dearie, you're just ssdd. you're not unique or even all that intellegent. you just follow the crowd because you haven't an original thought in your head. but that's ok, we don't blame you, per se, we know you can't control your behavior. emoticonxrolleyes	not a chance.
0	Because I don't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online. But for a quick summary: The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15% of caucasians, with 1% having the homogeneous version. These 1% are completely immune. The heterogeneous people possess some immunity.	Why don't you do it for me?
0	does it really matter? the heller decision left the door wide open for most of the restrictions that brady campaign favors. why should this case be any different?	every time california wants a new law, it will have to go back to court to see if it will be allowed.
0	ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works(2:10). i must admit that im not totally sure what this means, that faith leads to good works? id dispute that. whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith, romans 2:6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds. in the end, the point is moot. i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone (and it doesnt conclusively), my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway.	wrong again, christianity is definately exclusive (john 14:6) jesus did say 'come' but it must be on his terms (repentance)
0	So the initial murder wasn't enough to show "that they are willing to commit acts of violence"? This makes absolutely no sense.	This has shown that they are willing to commit acts of violence and frankly have nothing to lose.
0	No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.	with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species wouldn't the old species not exist any more?

0	Well, if they've re-established control in New Orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. If they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (I'm very pro-2nd Amendment, so don't get me wrong here. I'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)I also think that it's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in--just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt. for NOT sending in the military. Now people are criticizing them for doing it???	Sending in the army in full force, confiscating guns and talking about an 'insurgency' just because of a couple of crackpots have been firing their guns.On an average day in New York there are 10 times as many reports of shootings, yet I don't see such a massive military response over there...
1	Well, it's not as though you hold your tongue all that often when it serves in support of an anti-gay argument.	And I've held my tongue on this as long as I can.
0	So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.	When San Jose, California, police test-fired an Uzi, a 30-round magazine was emptied in slightly less than two seconds on full automatic, while the same magazine was emptied in just five seconds on semiautomatic.
0	Would you mind telling us just how he determined ALL maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements? To me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so! After all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence! Your claim would seem to be impossible, but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so.	A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.
0	does the grand canyon strike you as a 'crack' as well? like? what makes them so dangerous if it ain't their guns and their willingness to use them?  this assumes that no da is presently going after them. something i highly doubt.  diversionary tactic on your part. wouldn't making guns harder for them to acquire be helpful?	always a case that slips through the cracks... well how about we focus on the genuine problem instead of making something else into a problem.
0	And I see you still flip back and fourth from being an atheist to not being an atheist.	(Oh, and I see you're still equating "atheist" with "anyone who doesn't believe as I do")
0	Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars.	That's their prerogative, as it was obviously a private screening and that's the way it works.
1	Here is a mind blower. Maybe they are celebate because being married to Jesus they are saving themselves for sex with him.	:) God could easily call someone to try serving him through priesthood to allow them to get the experience, and choose for themselves whether it is something that uses their god-given gifts the best.

The internet site also quotes:	[Not arguing with creationists] This is not because I cannot answer their arguments, but because I have better things to do with my time and I do not want to give them the oxygen of publicity.
0	They do it on purpose, alright. But not because it'll be shot down -- in at least one state, the Supreme Court decided that similar legislation did not address more than one issue.The reason they put them together is that, in most states, a ban on civil unions would FAIL.	They push through the amendment to quiet the RR while the issue is a hot botton topic, but make sure it's unconstitutional so that it'll get shot down.Just a thought.

0	Origins of science, whether truly started by those of faith or not, is irrelevant. Whatever science was, it has become a body of knowledge, through application of reason.	‘The philosophy of experimental science…began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation… It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.'

1	like i said in another thread, the argument i hear most often from so-called 'pro-choicers' is that you cannot legislate morality. well then what can you legislate? every law in existence is legislation of morality! by that way of thinking, then we should have no laws. if someone kidnaps and murders your 3-year-old child, then let's hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality!	what do you see as the major flaw of the view opposite of your in regards to how abortion should be dealt with?

1	Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right.	The problem with this is that usually when someone exercises "their right" it many times infringes on someones elses rights.

0	Again???? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens (i.e. black) from owning guns... Liberal terms such as "saturday night special" all have racist undertones. Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority... Who are these laws meant to target?	Have I proposed a law which would restrict gun usage for only a certain race?
0	This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a "special right" is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays...... but for most people, they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit.I think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee's sexual orientation.But to utilize your phrasing Archie, do you think that religion is something that deserves "special rights"?	You think you deserve special rights?

0	even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo.	governmental funding is not available (to my knowledge) without some (if not total) government control of the program.

0	that seems to beg the question. be convinced one way or the other as much as you like, but if you can't prove your position, or even provide evidence for it, then how can you possibly use it to justify anything? yes, people's religious beliefs influence them. what shooter seems to be asking is if that's in any way reasonable? if you're basing your entire life on some point, should you be able to show that your beliefs about that point are true? put another way, it's kinda dumb to base major life decisions on a feeling, isn't it?	believing whether god exists or not is a huge factor in not only determining day to day decisions, but entire identities and lifestyles.

I am not entitled to my own opinion if it doesn't agree with yours.

0	hmmm, the employment, housing, and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state doesn't allow you to ask about sexual orientation.  as for marriage...anyone is allowed to marry (so long as they are of age). you just have a problem with the definition of marriage. as for the military thing...seems like a complicated issue. where does a gay man shower for example? the womans bathroom? there own special bathroom? the mens bathroom? other issues involving relationships could arise as well. as for the adoption thing...only florida doesn't allow it outright.	christians can join the military and mention they are christian.
0	Let's not confuse our readers. supersport is not saying it's evolution; he's saying that "evolutionists" say that it's evolution.

0	But it is based on history. There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions. Or, if their families had money. went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries.Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services.	Not only that, to suggest that untold numbers of women would seek illegal abortions is a question-begging claim that has no grounding in history, logic, or reason.
0	They originally might have been an arbitrary guess, but experience of all humans always has given them a very high probability of being true (at least the existence of the outside world, the others are abstract logical concepts that don't have a physical reality, just an abstract one).	One of these aspects of existence which we arbitarily believe in is cause and effect.
0	Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.	Still, some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language.

1	OMG SO TRUE!!! Two of my friends chose to be asian, my mom chose to be a woman, and my PE teacher chose to be black. OMGZZ@! YOURE SO RIGHT!!!	I'm betting the percentages are something like 10% or less have no choice...90% or more choose to be gay.
0	why are you trying to turn this into a religious debate? no one said anything about finding jesus. all you have done is show your anti-god prejudice.	so if he 'found jesus' he could be the president?
0	this an example of what i am saying you choose to ignore the moral command from the ot to burn witches whereas in the middle ages that moral command was followed this passage also mentions that you must pay taxes as well, are you rebelling against god if you complain about the redistribution of wealth through taxation if it set by the governing authority ? i also believe that passage can cause all sorts of problems, for example a fascist regime is a governing authority should you submit to a government that is morally unjust ?  bad in general, and no i don't think the same. as i said i have started to modify my socialist principles, i have a great sympathy for the anarchist way of thinking. where the state is a way to oppress the masses.	next they should repent and receive christ for the forgiveness of their sins, like all christians should.
1	Oh.. that makes sense. Because, it sounds exactly like modern day republicans.	Generally creationists follow an ideology which forbids questioning of beliefs, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly..
0	Maybe you are having trouble with the concept of "low premium, high deductible". That means the monthly payments (premiums) are low, and the deductible is higher (cost you actually pay for services). This shouldn't be a problem. How often do you actually use your health insurance? I use mine very rarely (not at all in the last year). It appears that what Bush is trying to do is get insurance coverage to low income folks without a multi trillion dollar price tag (like kerrys plan carries). This isn't a bad thing, and I am not even a bush supporter.	nslation: the government will tell the citizens what kind of bank account they need to get to save up for their own health costs -- then pay it yourself.
0	But bestiality consists of animal cruelty, so very much hurts another. Just not another human.	bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments, since their logic is about the same (i.e., not illegal, not hurting anyone else), and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future.
1	If the same question had been posed by different polls over time it would be easier to draw trends from the responses..... but good luck with finding some trends in amongst that lot.

1	wow, so you're saying that christianity should be able to stand the test of extreme scrutiny? are you trying to use this as an excuse to bash it time and again? great idea! i think you should spread the wealth a little! bash some hindus and buddhists and jews! oh, wait- no that is discrimination!!! you racist! i think that christianity has definitely should the test of extreme scrutiny long enough! millions of christians have been killed in history as martyrs.	if christianity is a worthy religion, it will stand the test of extreme scrutiny.

Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air. It is obviously part of our psyche. Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith.

0	It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft.Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i don't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves(a basic human right) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours.Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since?	It sounds icky, and is to a degree but seems better than feeding them to maggots or just burning them.Fair enough if you want have it as an option like Organ Donors but seems the same thing really to me, especially as there are babies that die because they need immediate organ or tissue donors after being born.Its the allegations of babies being killed to fund this I doubt, seems to be an attempt to sensationalise a piece of news.
1	You're equating atheism and homosexuality with terrorism and drug dealing? Really? Can you stop being a reactionary dolt long enough to convince me you're worth even trying to converse with? If not, I'll understand... and not be surprised.	Well if they're gonna be shelling out that shellac on a shingle for atheists, homosexuals, pedophiles, abortionists, special interest groups, terrorists, pornographers, business owners, prostitutes, drug dealers, illegal immigrants, dictators, the Untied Nations, and ACORN...then is it really too much to ask them to extend the same courtesy to people who actually believe in the Constitution?

In other words, write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack. emoticonXDonno	This is why religion may not survive the future.People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.The only hope is if the nuts stop making it in to an adversarial situation.Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, but that is already clear to anyone who knows his work here.

1	wow, you have a g.e.d. what happened? dropped out of high school? or did you flunk out? judging by you sentences (if you can call them that), you flunked out. and as for me, i have a computer engineering associates degree and i'm working towards my bachelors of science in computer engineering, so keep that in mind. i suppose the 'really important things' that you are learning that aren't reading and writing is how to roll a joint or take lsd since i couldn't imagine what a person who still lives in his mom's basement learns.	lol well let me tell u how it works were i'm from in california people fight with each for the opportunity to stab rapists yea i'm not to good at sentences or spelling i spent time learning more important things i have never needed spelling or how to write anything really important to b honest but i do have a g.e.d lol let me guess why ur mad becuase u still live with ur mom
1	i have no reason to believe it's false, and reason to believe it is true. relax ladies and gentlemen, that test of the find-a-cook system passed with flying colours. you're having trouble understanding english again, maybe you should hire a translator? if it is not a crime then it cannot be an accusation, and is likely a fact.	dispatchers have no duty to protect you either, neither do the cops.
0	We cannot prove the existence of God for, by definition, he dwells in a reality outside our own. Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace, nor can I disprove it, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists, by definition, in Hyperspace.I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe. A round square, a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously, you name it.	If God exists, and he wanted his existence proven, he could prove it.
0	Intelligent design comes in many flavors too.ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?	What about other 'rational' alternatives to your version of evolution; such as that postulated by ID theorists?
1	i find it funny you think article v was repealed yet the bill of rights references article v for passage.  so we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but article v which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? you've really lost it haven't you. what do you mean 'sos' by the way? save our ship haha? i have been saving your ship.	if you can repeal the bor, any one of them there is nothing to stop you from repealing the articles either is there?

1	you mean pascals sucker bet? if arch is wrong, he's wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood, a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their 'flocks'. he's prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured.  furthermore, he's extolling others to do so also. because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold, they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude.	can you provide scriptures that confirm that the ungodly will be tortured for eternity in indestructible bodies?
0	oh yeah, i forgot that you believe that the corporate media and corporate leaders have gotten together to create war and put innocents in jail. i will admit that the powers of the executive branch have gone way too far, but i still believe that being at war means we have to treat the enemy like our enemy, and not like american civilians. do i agree with the war? no. but that's only because i feel that we could have done this all with special forces and not with an invasion/occupation. i would still support detaining terrorists captured in battle/mission (and if they're americans, give them a proper trial, not a military tribunal or some bullshit like that).	really, oh well when you put it that way, actually just out of curiosity who are you fighting against, oh yeah, a tactic called terrorism which you use more than any other nation on earth.
1	Oh come on. If those words were hateful, then you need to 'investigate' probably millions of people, because those are pretty normal sentiments. Canada must have a LOT of tax dollars. I don't entirely agree with what he said either, but I think it's downright scary that your govt. investigates something like that.	This does not mean all hate speech will be illegal, only that there are limits.
1	You mean you're for real? You're not setting out deliberately to make creationists look as if they don't know what they're talking about? Because that's all you're achieving.  Still no source for the trillions, I see.	ya try again.. im 18 and still in high school.. wanna try again with that scientist bit?
0	What we have here is simply a perspective problem, which is the problem with most debates. I see the Bible as sound, and every "error" in the Bible I have researched (I have admittedly not researched them all) have been refuted.	What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be.
0	So everyone thinks that "evolutionists" should seize power or something? If that is true, it is because evolution is very widely accepted.	The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless.
0	i guess this disease is 'contagious' thus due to this contagious disease it can spread rapidly. if he dies then no one gets infected and vice versa. although, i believe that if that is the situation i don't the infected persons opinion matters. if you possibly may kill even 1 person you will probably be isolated from social world and be taken to a place where you have no contact with the public no questions asked.	i think it would make a difference!
0	Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.	We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution,
0	And what if it is one to me? Then your refute is equally refuted. The support for us not knowing lies in you and other's inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person. Your own inability is my support.	I tell you now, a fetus is not morally a person to me.
0	The comic relief doesn't even recognize it has passed in on, or attempted to!	I don't know, yours is overwhelming, who gave it to you?
0	Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events.	What is supposed to take thousnds/ millions of years for populations of animals to evolve has just taken a swift punch to the gut by David Reznick.

0	You misunderstand me I believe they should all be locked up. Anyone who preaches against gay people freely living their lives as equal citizens with all the rights and responsibilites should be locked up in the darkest dungeon. There can be no compromise on this issue peoples lives are at stake.	If Canada limited it's persecution only to those who are trying to change the law, there wouldn't be a problem.
0	I don't know if you ever heard of the UK Poll Tax but I could have seen myself protesting by non-payment against such a grotesquely unfair system of taxation had I been of the age to do so.	Lets say your tax rate is 25% but you thought that was too much, would you just pay the amount you felt was fair?
0	Bellesiles claimed his data was destroyed in a flood. Lott claimed his data was destroyed in a computer crash. Some people have been calling John Lott "the Bellesiles of the Right." Read this article "The Bellesiles of the Right? Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data."http://slate.msn.com/id/2078084/John Lott has already admitted to inventing a fan (Mary Rosh) to praise himself. That's intentionally trying to deceive people. http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp...&notFound=true	There maybe something wrong with it, but "thinking someting is wrong" and actually being wrong are two different things.Bellesiles is most definately a liar and there is no debate or confusion about it.
1	Ha, that is just an idiotic perspective. We'd have no laws (and many important ones) if you can't make a bill that doesn't affect you. Sorry Civil Rights legislation!	Politicians that propose anti-gun legislation don't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect, they shouldn't be allowed to propose it.
0	What would you know about fair and balanced?emoticonXCensoredI know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?	I didn't think posters were required to "balance" their opinions here.At least now we see what passes for "moderation" on this board.
0	Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim, that can be refuted through logic, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct.This new claim is an interesting one that I have seen others use. I'll tell you on what basis. Based on reason. To hold that nothing can be known for certain, is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense. I'll start a thread about this claim, it's a hot topic to be sure!	Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?
0	Working on it. Apparently we are still waiting for to to be graded (it was really big, at leat 20 typed pages).

0	your probably referring to the mexican basin crater. mass extinction doesn't prove evolution. the flood as described in the Bible is an example of mass extinction. besides, in order for the asteroid theory to work, the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning. also similiar to the effects of the flood.	The mass extinction is a fact and so is evolution.

0	I think a free society works better by saying "You have to have at least a certain variety to give your customers a choice in products". Businesses should have the restrictions, not private citizens.	If you go around saying "you must do it this way" then you really aren't a free society but you have the government controlling instead.
0	Can we get away from quoting 5 year old posts? Seriously, if you don't take the time to actually read the thread why should I respond to your post?	I wouldn't say one can't be a Christian if they support abortion but I find it really hard to understand how one justifies or rectifies it with the Bible or their faith.
0	Actually, I've heard it all before and it is wrong. The article is full of misinformation and misrepresentation. It is, as you say, slanted rather than an honest report of the data.	Not that anyone here cares to read the Creationist slant on soft tissue found in dinosaurs...but here it is

1	Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis.	Also, given that you don't like his stated position on gay marriage (i.e., that marriage is a state issue), it appears to me that you don't like democracy either.
1	Right, expect when talking about the 14th amendment. The way you guys like to define "equal protection" would make it so any restriction is unequal.	No one I know on my side argues simply for "equality in marriage", period full stop.
0	I think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited. Space, time, energy, matter and laws all came into existence together. Of course that's impossible for us to envisage....	the problem then is, how could the universe begin in the midst of absolutely nothing (no time, no matter, no space, no energy)?
0	And it is. The ToE is a theory, however. It explains evolution, which has been observed. Do not attempt to deny that.	Evolutionists, in an attempt to win converts, have a habit of saying evolution is a fact.

0	Actually, everything the bible say's belies your "atheist answer". The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident. It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior, but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life.	Theist answer: the bible says that without faith its impossible to please God, and since the bible also says that the bible is God's true word, then we only need faith to believe the bible and by extension to believe in God.
0	On an internet forum why is that so important? The bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is, but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he isn't and adjust accordingly.My guess is this is not the only place this happens. These things happen, you fall, you get up, people laugh, you move on, you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up. Just depends on who you want to be.Sorry I am a sucker for empty milk crates. Can't seem to walk by one without jumping on and taking her for a spin.	I agree, but when you know your opponent will succeed in making you look weak if you give them the chance, trying to look like the bigger man will do Jack for you.

0	Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the "friendlyatheist.com" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/But then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist. emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead	Where better to find more info on the evolutionary migration of humanity than from friendly atheist.com.
0	why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent.	for example, when you have a healthy marriage, children will generally model themselves after their parents (disclaimer note i said 'generally' there are exceptions, however disclaimer).

1	i do not understand how sexism, slavery and filicide fit into a being that is supposed to be infinitely moral. care to justify that for me? oh wait... you can't.	yes, practices at the time condoned many of the things you state, but the bible was about jesus with many of the practices of the time added as historical color not relevant to the actual text itself.
0	well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort.	so where is voting being used as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay rights movement?
0	This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.	There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists... unless you first believe through faith that God exists.

1	Well if you already know you're for guns, then you should know the basic reasons, right? Or was this an uninformed decisions (I heard from my friend that guns are good)? But basically other people have said it. They're protected by the Constitution, they generally result in lower crime rates, and they can be used for defense as well as hunting. Oh, but the burden of proof isn't on the people supporting guns, but those who wish to ban guns. Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable.	Can you all just tell me if you are for guns or not and a short reason why?Thank you.
1	Waxy:  Why are you standing by saying nothing while one of your own is continuing to show how ignorant he is by asserting Isochron was not used at KBS Tuff ?  Ray M.	if you aren't willing to answer questions or provide proof of your assertions, how is it possible to have a debate in good faith?
0	No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed. It does not mean that "life is irreducibly complex" since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion. And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like "pieces that happen to be fitted together". More and more like a complex kludge. Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one!	Life, as is the genome, is a system -- an irreducibly complex system -- not an assortment of pieces that just happen to be fitted together over time via random genetic changes culled by nonrandom death.

0	Forgive me if this seems picky, but I just want to try and fully understand this argument. I should say that I don't necessarily agree with it, and would like to respond as to why. I just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that I can make a sound response.As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.... Where does this right originate from, i.e., is it from the US Constitution via the 14th amendment etc?

0	surely, we can only 'guesstimate' how many living species have escaped our attention ? but how probable is it that only 1% of all the species that ever existed escaped extinction ?  i think your point about mass extinctions may be a key to what has puzzled me.	the number of living species that have escaped our attention cannot compare to those that have gone extinct over several billion years of life with numerous mass extinctions, remembering that fossils are rare.
0	Actually, the answer might depend more on the nature of the question, or the particular religious cult of the person being asked, etc. In questions of science, fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture.On the other hand, you are characterizing religion as insanity. I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science, then that is insane.	If I was to ask a religious person of a provable way that he found out about his belief he would have to say that he was told.
1	That post is not only off topic, but yet a further example of your being completely out of touch with reality.	<Flush>People can speak well and be blooming imbeciles, like the left wing loons who think the right for individuals to bear arms is dangerous.What's dangerous are the liberal dweebs who are bankrupting the country with their cradle to grave entitlement programs to the point where we're going to have to start gutting our military just to pay the interest on the debt Obama is running up.
1	Yep, so much for a pastor knowing his sheep(le).  It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.  What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???  As to this case.  I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.  But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock.	if it is true that having a membership of over 2000 members means that you 'really have no idea who is walking through your doors,' then it's not an argument for armed guards; it's an argument against big crowds.
0	i'm totally surprised i've posted so many posts in this thread: not like me at all.	assuming you were correct about the experiment, were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of, a large variety of fruit flies to begin with, random mating, etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies, did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that?

1	I'm going to ask you a direct question, which I am sure you will ignore.John is an atheist.He has stolen some money. He is sincerely remorseful over his actions.Since John is remorseful, has your Judeo-Christian God FORGIVEN John?You can "blah, blah, blah" all you want, but a "yes" or a "no" needs to be given EXPLICITLY in your answer.	ns was accomplished for all of humanity 2000 years ago on the Cross.
1	There are somewhere between 10 and 20 million gay people is America. 10,000 is a small minority, yes. And even your article admits this number is unsubstantiated, AA. More lying for JESUS.	Does a possible 25% of all new infections reported annually sound like a small minority in the gay community ?http://www.annoy.com/editorials/doc....umentID=100455
1	World government is just around the bend! What shall we call it...The Company...The Authority...The End?	Could be our new industry if we invade more countries and make them buy our chips.
0	So please, feel free to leave this thread to those who DO wish to discuss the issue. No one is forcing you to discuss the topic of this or any other thread. I notice you evidently are not interested in "Understanding "Sexual Prejudice"" That is absolutely fine with me.Or are you now opposed to "Freedom of Speech" also?	There are lots of people who would and do give full support to civil rights, but not to issues of homosexuality.
0	I think that the type of weapon does make a difference. A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives.	This is why we go to war against folks like Saddam regarding WMDs, or declare sanctions against Syria and Irans, but we do not go to war with the french or the british over WMD's.
0	But the law of angular momentum does not require that all parts of a spinning object spin in the same way now does it. If so then something like a rotary engine for an aircraft would not be possible!	[The Law of Angular Momentum states that if an object breaks apart in a frictionless environment, then the fragments will all spin the same direction.
1	Not the best school system there although the Mayor has a nice car I hear emoticonXClown	Take the same poll in Detroit and I wonder what the results would be.
0	I think you misunderstand my view. I think that a third-term fetus is already sufficiently a person, so I would CERTAINLY consider a newborn baby a person. To me, a person is one who has the most basic, rudimentary sense of thought and emotion. A late-term fetus, from my point of view, is no less a person than an Einstein. An Einstein, of course, is much more useful to a much greater number of people, but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person, I would say not.	if a woman is raped, and a two year old is raped, is it not an equally bad crime considering the two year old didn't understand what was happening?I have the same view on abortion.
0	wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions	What you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality?
1	Yeeees, that's why option 4 as I wrote it says "reinterpret" as opposed to "reject."   Having a bad reading day, eh?	Maybe they dont' rejest the bible teachings, but interpret it differently than you.
0	Well he HAS admitted he can't prove his belief. I guess that posting here would admit his false dichotomies that it's either literal genesis or evolution are false and god knows the world will end when that happens. Super admitting he's wrong? Never going to happen.	Of course he won't come over here...
1	Hmmm.... your religious predecessors would have sentenced you to house arrest for something so heretical.	well if you think the sun goes around the earth then its time for apocalypse.
1	So what are you claiming now? That all this time that Rosie was making fun of the Chinese, she's actually been Chinese all the while? Because that's the only legitimate way you could draw a parallel with those people who are hypocritically attacking gays while being gay themselves.	If you all are going to take glee in hypocrisy of religious activists against gay rights, you might as well realize that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
1	Well, you certainly defended this video, Archangel. How interesting to now hear that you were defending material you hadn't even viewed.   But I'm not going to do your homework for you. It's on this thread; jyoshu posted it. So search his posts on these pages.	Would you please repost this infamous video rather than just constantly referring to it as an example the dishonesty of "MY" student zealots?
0	my dear; sweetie; (and any other ridiculous and intentionally patronizing words you regularly use) i don't support the gop. i think both parties are corrupt. you on the other hand, seem to have sold your soul to the dnc a long time ago.	my dear, i don't know who first invented the word 'christianist', but i saw it used frequently on andrew sullivan's website, and he's no liberal, just another christian conservative, only not a complete idiot.
0	This is a pretty loose definition.It's like saying you have faith that Jesus will come again because you personally witnessed his ressurection.But you didn't, you have faith because you believe this with absolutely no material evidence or logic to back it up.	We have faith the sun will rise to-morrow morning, but the knowledge can not be actual until after sunrise.'
0	So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated.	The Tec-9 was banned under President Clinton's semiautomatic weapon order some years ago and is no longer made, but the ones that are still out there can be legally sold.
0	And here you reveal your prediliction for reading what you want to see into the words of others. I described materialism embracing new forces and phenomena which have withstood the rigors of the scientific method. I explicitly described science as a methodology, not a philosophy. You are wrong about me, WW, and the longer you pretend otherwise, the more time you're going to waste on strawmen and the more chances I'm going to get to make your arguments look silly. It's up to you. Argue with me, or argue with the person you want me to be.	Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism.
1	How remarkable. What a singular idea to invent a contest of skill in which a person in opposition tries to prevent one from outperforming them. Is this the only type of game in which there are two sides, or is this a novelty?	That is because the opposite side tries to stop you from scoring them.
1	then explain why the moon isn't burning, after all, it's significently larger then any known comet.  this is beyond ignorant. explain how something far smaller then the moon could sustain nuclear fusion for millions of years yet brown dwarfs which are larger then the moon can't.  coronal mass ejections are not even similar to comets. we have evidence of what comets are. spectrum analysis of light given off by vaporization tells us exactly what they are made of. given your comments, i'm not surprised that the scientific contributions of the islamic world over the past 50 years have essentially been nothing.	moreover, i only ask could it possible that such masses separated from the sun, may retain some of the nuclear property of the sun, and could this explain the radiation that once had been found at tunguska?
1	are you telling me you cannot figure out how creating a gay-hostile atmosphere causes and condones anti-gay bullying? forsooth! butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, would it.	people should not bully no matter what they see on someone's t-shirt.
0	Well, by the strict defintion of the word "born", an abortion is considered a premature birth.	Now, if the mother chooses to abort that person will not be born.
1	Oh you do love to do the psychological technique known as 'transference' don't you...or is it 'projection'???   You are so obsessed with gay sex, I would not be surprised if you and Ted Haggard have a lot to talk about.	emoticonXHohoTrebor is certainly a hypocrite.
0	No one said he invented guns!A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[1] To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[1][2]	Except for the fact that guns were around long before Browning was ever born.
1	Hardy, har har! It is nice to see sinjin is still "hanging" around :)	The comment in red is your response.Now, anyone with a modicum of knowledge of the English language knows that the "THEY" you are referring to is the subject of my preceding statement "gang bangers".
0	The criminals in DC already have their guns. All striking down DC's handgun ban will do is let the law abiding be able to better defend themselves and be armed for a change.	The court will not hear the case so more guns on the street emoticonXKill
0	Listen, I have forgotten more than you will ever learn about what is real and true in this world, so either back up your insults with facts or get lost because It is becoming painfully obvious that attempting to reason with you is an exercise in futility. kind of like trying to travel from point A to point B on a merry-go-round.	Perhaps too much bible has rotted your brain?
0	It doesn't matter whether it is religous or not. The odds of anyboy being fired over such a thing are slim to none. Morning after pills can not possibly make up eough of any given pharmacys revenue to make it worth the expense of replacing a skilled employee.	In that case it may not be illegal, but if I got that in writing, that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim, it makes it easy to fire them since it's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons (race/religion/color, etc.)
1	Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained.	I mean i understand if you do but I would like to make some points about it.....there are also some points procing creation.
1	That would be the fault of you rather than us. Everyone knows a small mind can't see what's beyond it's comprehension level.	maybe the ammo has gone to your brains and the lead has really affected you gun loonies, for there is no much sign of intelligence in any of you.
1	i love how the apple fan is illiterate. what exactly is the great thing that apple invented?	samsung produces apple clones for several years, they have ideas or concepts on they own.
0	if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation (i,e., six days, man from dust, fruit of good and evil) then what is its use? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated, or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical? genesis 1&2, in the literal application, has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without: 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises. now if genesis has it wrong, then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible? from all scientific perspective, genesis 1&2 never happened, and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned.	should modern science be able to prove without the shadow of a doubt that man evolved from amoeba, reptiles, animal life into what he is today, orthodox theology would be able to make the transitional acceptance far more readily than western theology for all the reasons stated above.
1	Hey, Jack, in case it missed your expert scrutiny, I'm first normally responding to some pro-gay argument that's referenced in a great many of those posts. There's scores of you guys defending such iniquity at any given time. Just look at the last twenty posts and it's five or more of you pro-gay pundits vs. one or two respondents. Seems to me it your cause to promote and defend, just like we're seeing across America. Make you guys a deal: You shut up about it and it will greatly please me to never mention it. I don't suppose you will ever do that now, will you? LOL!	And no, I didn't take the time to count them individually: just go to the members' list and sort by number of posts.
1	Not only would I throw the switch, I'd pay the electric bill, too. emoticonXGood	He loves to pull the executioner's switch.
1	If we did not have criminals, we wouldnt have "shoot outs" as you so call them.	2) More guns and have more shootouts between the bad guys and good guys.
0	Gary Ridgway, the serial murderer of some 60 or more women, possibly more.	Gary Ridgway could be more insane that Andrea Yates, but he was punished and she was not.
0	It's been reported in the Telegraph as well as several other news outlets. Want to slander them as well or do you want to try to disprove their story based on its content. I suggest the former, because the University has already confirmed the authenticity of the e-mails and documents. emoticonXRolleyes	Ah so, the extremely biased right wing rag owned by cult leader Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church cult which believes that Moon is the Christ.
1	How do you know if they WANT to believe in a deity? They simply don't.	Second, the majority of the world believes there is a god, and the others don't want to believe (hope there isn't) a god
0	In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.	Would you care to support that claim with actual evidence or is it your intent to once again just lump everyone on the Right into the same pot of Funamental Christianity so as to slander us all as a group ?
1	You forgot about the youth recruitment efforts as well. I am president of the local chapter of "Get 'Em While They're Young." Our mission (agenda, if you will) is to recruit and convert the kids in an effort to increase the prevalence of homosexuality to 20% by 2015, then 51% by mid-century when we will have total control, muahahahahaha!!!	The Gay agenda has been to normalize homosexuality and what better way to do it than to indoctrinate the young and desensitize them to the negatives of the lifestyle while they're still impressionable.
0	oh yeah! i remember that one... abbynestor was going off on everyone, so i told to to calm down and then everyone (including the people she was ripping on) starting yelling and calling me a dick.  like honestly dana got called a bunch of nasty stuff, i try to defend her and she gets snappy with me...like what? that's why i'm going to stay away from that stuff now.	yeah and there was one debate that i had to stop because it was getting out of hand.
1	You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic? Talk about ABORTING.	poor boo-boo...You want to talk pain?I wish the pro-infanticide zealots could experience being dismembered and having their skulls collapsed and their brains sucked out so they'll know what an innocent baby feels when it's being aborted.
1	Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!	Okay, let's look at evolution.
1	I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.	The first reasonable alternative explanation is that it never happened as alleged.

0	The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved (even on the balance of probabilities) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith.	Where does one need faith, exactly, to make claims about evolution (hint: faith is not needed).
1	In the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt.	Even better were does it say that evolution is proven?
1	Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.	Actually no such right exists, for you or anybody else.
0	Not sure how you can tell that since very little is mentioned about his methods.	His method appears to be good, i.e.
1	wow, this was up to 6 points at one time. down-voting it without a rebuttal surely refutes it.	until such time this burden of proof is satisfied, the logical position is the position of skepticism.
0	Might be something to be said for that. Are there any studies that show possible causes of suicide?	...is that they think that ...they aren't loved...
0	Come on, people. You don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. There's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. And if no one else would have, I would have.	He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child.
0	What basis do fundamental rights derive from? In other words, how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right?	If you think about it, slavery requires life.
0	I would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then. That is a new species, and it is not man doing it, but rather nature itself.	Besides observing it, the way to demonstrate evolution is to manipulate a species until it developes into a new species, but alas, then all you will have proven is directed efforts of intelligent beings create species.
0	like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized. http://kevinantoine.com/holytrinity.htm now why does that matter? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man. you have made absolutely no progress towards that end. do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility.	what do you care if i type it out or someone else does, as long as you get the information?
1	So what's your point, Bush is as Liberal as the most Liberal Senator in Congress?	If that isn't appeasing liberals and moderates, what is?
1	you really need to stop reading such biased, uninformed digital-age fishwrapper. i can think of at least one instance off the top of my head, justice alito's confirmation. the democrats threatened to filibuster bush's scotus choice. the gang of seven democrats agreed not to filibuster in return for the republicans not to use the 'nuclear option'. it was in all of the papers. i'm surprised that the leftwing rag missed it. emoticonxrolleyes	as ed says to joan -- the key question she never answers while disagreeing with dean -- is when did the republicans ever need 60 votes under george bush?
0	No, it's often an emotional show. They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing. The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him. There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticonXWow	Note that I`m not saying there is anything wrong with displaying emotions unless your drunk or hung-over, I cry even when I`m not hung-over I`ve just noticed this weird relationship between movies or tv-shows, crying and hang-overs.
1	Math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it.	It really is confusing.
0	should we clear up what we're talking about at all? i think adultery is legal in 24 states, and i'm pretty sure adultery laws have been pretty much completely unenforced since world war ii. i don't know of any states where a polygamous relationship with no marriage involved is illegal. now, certainly having multiple marriage licenses is illegal...	that is why i said if i saw a polygamous marriage situation, i would contact the authorities, because in more cases than none; young women are being taken advantage of by someone much older; the tom green situation.
1	yes, it's david koresh's fault that the fbi burnt children alive, right? disgusting. however evil or deluded david koresh might have been, nothing he did compares to gassing and then setting on fire large numbers of children, an act you apparently applaud.	the fault is the cult's, not those that came to enforce the law and were met with gunfire.
1	Well if it's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades? And while you're at it, supply the names of the companies who're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions.	So easy to do in America, a nation which refuses to acknowledge the need for responsible gun ownership.
0	Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory. Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved.	Do not deceive yourself into thinking that "literal" Biblical Creation would be proved true if evolution were proven false.
0	Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again.	Are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions?
1	really? damn! i wanna be awesome too. are you selling awesomeness or do i have to develop it on my own? if it's a lot of work, i might just settle on being mediocre.	but i will tell you i'm pretty awesome.
1	Aw shucks! And I reckon in Kansas they won't ever care whether or not you learn how to spell ATHEIST.	All we wanted was a little balance between science and faith and for that balance to be initially manifested from the bottom up, not from the top down, which has been the case ever since the materialists and athiests.
0	So the stats come from John Lott.... Wasn't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause? http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may...on/oe-wiener31http://whoismaryrosh.com/....a bizarre individual who I don't think can be trusted.	http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdgcon.htmlWhat is so doubtful about it?
1	No, this is the point of the 10th amendment. Article 1 Section 8 applies to Congress...the 10th amendment grants all powers not listed to the states or people.   The 14th amendment is not the "federal government can do whatever" amendment.	The constitution does not allow states to do whatever they want for what they may call the general welfare.
1	Is it possible to be an adult and be as clueless as you seem to be?  This was in response to the question did Jesus not believe in evolution.  Only someone with similar mental capacity to yours would ask such a question.  It seems unfair I have to answer this senseless comment you added to the nonsense.	and the validity of your arguement here rests upon the yec reading of genesis, so it is not conclusive.
0	i agree with you dear... good reply of question... :)	have you tried clicking on ' my profile' then' find latest posts' jet?
1	oh really? then why don't we go naked and live in a forest or jungle? ................ i did not mean to say that i say we are different but the same.	====================================== just because they can't say no they still show that they don't like it.
1	Or maybe they do? Could this sick, perverted individual be the spokesperson for the so called "gay movement"?	No pro-gays printed it!Maybe because they don't agree with it
1	So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed?	at least not the kind you chance-worshiping evolutionists want.
0	too right. l. ron hubbard is the closest thing the modern world has to jesus: skeezy, probably un-bathing, secretly greedy but always with a generous front. well, i guess mother theresa would be a close second to l.ron h. xenu.	the fact that it still exists in modern society is just a sign of how idiotic people can be.
0	So what? If somebody wants to die then they'll kill themselves no matter what.	Now firearm deaths in the US in 1999 totalled 28,874 of which more than 16,500 were suicides, 10,800 murders and the rest accidental or undetermined.
1	Yep, Martha is in trouble and the democrats are panicking.   I think the strong Independent support for her opponent is due to Martha's own lack of appeal.   By they way, I have to ask....since "The anointed one" was in your neck of the woods, did you get a peek at him? prehaps even wave at him (with all 4 fingers) ;)	Maybe that is the way it is done in Chicago or some third world country run by a dictator.
1	i have never heard a conservative who was pro gay let alone pro same sex marriage. do you know of any? there is an old term that seems to apply 'if the shoe fits'. please i would like to know who these conservatives are that want gay people to be able to legally marry. who are they? since as you say i speak in generalities then you should have no problem listing these pro gay or por gay marriage conservatives. just because someone believes that the government should not be in the marriage busisness, as a libertarian, doesn't mean they support gay marriage.	it doesn't matter if you think he did or not, imo he did.
0	simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately.	if those of my chosen party have made the claims that we want criminals, terrorists and the others in these categories to have guns, then i'd like to see them.
0	You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved.	Right or wrong for them, it's their decision to make, not yours or mine, and none of our business.
0	Except that the word for day in Genesis 1 is 'yom' and was understood to be a twenty-four hour day.	The meaning of the word "day" in the language the Bible was written in means basicly "a long period of time".
1	So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?  Interesting...	and i sincerely do say this out of love.
0	So there you have it: AMENDMENTS ARE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION.	The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution.
1	The Archbishop of York has a screw loose too on that subject.	and whereas our fellow poster Easyrider 'knows' that the bible condemns sexually active gays, the Archbishop of York declared last week that the christian attitude was welcoming acceptance.

0	what is the big deal here? so eharmony doesn't cater to gays. (there are also gay-only services out there that don't cater to straights.) if anyone doesn't like the service, they don't have to use it.	i thought this was a great artical and great spot.
1	Never heard of him...however, looks like those ever-loving proponents of free speech up in Canada showed Anne Coulter that 'free-speech' is Only what liberals make it to be.....	Ah, another proponent of nastiness.Say hello to your Hitler-loving brother in Pinson, Alabama, Mike Vanderboegh.
1	i just love how you attempt to be mr. forum police here steve. if you want to be a moderator so bad why not apply? i'm certain this board could use the help. as far as your scenario it's rather laughable but whatever. point being is if people demand evidence why not give them that? i'd rather be an open honest man than hide behind a handle any day.	not only that, you don't know how that might come back on the owner of this forum.
1	Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional.	The fact that somebody believes in intellient design does not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution.
0	baby, i am going to publicly say that if it wasn't for you i would be so out of here . oh yeah and for merlin too	i just wish we could get billie back.
1	If I thought you'd understand in the least bit why it's important to scrutinize possible occupants of the White House, I'd explain how I feel about. However, you are a hopeless case.	What in the heck does it have to do with the Whitehouse ?
1	For one to have evolution as their foundation belief, means that one cannot be certian of anything.....	Maybe your definition are in a sense better but many people adopt the position that when someone defines things you interept them using their defintions AND THEIR DEFINTIONS ALONE.
0	is this a case of the truth hurting? then i guess it would work both ways. how do you feel about 'christians' slagging off non-believers, declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god? conceited? yup. could i give a toss? nope. how do you think non-believers feel about the smugness of christians? and it's not just me who thinks they're fairytales and that christians are delusional, as you well know. so why personalise it? apart from that, a lot of us here have a thick skin. this is a debating forum, and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others.	they and millions like them would not consider them as fairy tales and would feel insulted by your attitude in this respect.
1	i just told you how. if you want to change your gender, then go ahead... but comparing it to changing clothes is just idiotic.  oh yeah! i forgot, you already think the entire human race is stupid... so i guess you have an excuse.	we are control of our own lives and if we want to change ourselves we have all right to do so.
