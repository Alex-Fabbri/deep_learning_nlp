0	good question.  let us say that dawkins is my teacher.  in the ben stien interview , dawkins said that evolution is fact, as much of a fact, as we can know anything to be a fact... ok?!?! dawkins also says that we do not know how life originates from inornanic, nonliving compounds and he says, that, he doesn't know and no one else does either. ok!!?! well i do not accept that as an explanation - so - i guess i am not blindly following this irrational line of logic. i would have to say that - i am not being 'indoctinated'. at the same time, dawkins has nothing to teach me so i guess i am not being 'educated' either. hmmm. i guess i would have to say that in this case i am - neither.	care to guess on which side you fall?
0	you wouldn't be a commodity at all if you weren't willing to sell, you'll be hunted though. i guess you could rent out your labor for a time if you somehow didn't get hunted and weren't willing to sell your genetic material.	why would you sell your genetic advantage to other people?
0	not according the SCJ of Mass. This was part of the grounds of their ruling FOR marriage in Mass.	That ruling was based on race, not gay marriages.Totally different.
0	and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant.	it may help to look at election in this way (wow, i almost wrote evolution emoticonxic)... god is deserving of all glory.
1	a majority of the planet believes in a higher power, so i allready have the majority agreement on this. how about you come up with a test to see if god doesnt exist... well? i'm waiting.	ok, since according to your claim, god is a natural part of us and everything in our universe, you can come up with a way to test for that claim.
1	Like I said, Catholic school. Or it could be that you're like 80 years old or something, because nowadays, if you talk about God or the Bible, then you don't get in trouble, you get criticized and made-fun-of, not only by your peers, but also by teachers.	they tell me what to believe.

1	You mean the guy who didn't tell his own cabinat he was going to Argentina to go get a little.. and left a power gap because no one knew where he was? You mean that guy?  That is a heck of a lot worse that actually having an affair. Eliot Spitzer at least had the decency to resign when he got caught being a hypocrite.   I personally don't care about his diddling with some woman.. although it does make him a hypocrite since he ran on the 'family values' campaign. It's that little thing about leaving his duties behind without communication that is the real destruction the public trust.	and 'cheating on his wife mark sanford' has to do what with electing big blabbermouths with nothing to say and absolutely nothing in the brainbox?
0	Falling, the fact that the homeschoolers you mentioned don't choose to socialize with you, doesn't mean they're not far more capable of functioning in the "REAL WORLD" than you might think. I would not choose to socialize with you in the "REAL WORLD", and you most likely would not choose to socialize with me, but that does not make me your social inferior!	i know almost as a fact that they would be much better off if they were not protected by their parents and allowed to live in the real world.
0	Actually, no. If it had not been for the gay couples and the organizations who helped them fight for equality it wouldn't be an issue now, but it would still be an issue.	Had it not been for Activist judges in Mass.

0	you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons.	it is clear that poland is a conducter of washington's will and ambitions in respect of the future of european union and they don't even try to conceal the fact that they see poland a wouldbe leader of europe which will certainly mean the end of eu as such.

0	if you check again you will find they do have self defense shootings in the list as well as accidents. the point is, as even you have now pointed out, the number is flawed. the source, vpc, knowingly used false data to further their claim. therefore eliminating any validity to their claim.  you and brady continue to trot out biased and inaccurate sources to back your arguement. you should stop, it does great harm to your credibility. wow, you really can leap tall mounds of logic in a single bound. what evidence do you have that any of these deaths would have been prevented by banning concealed carry? then also consider the lives saved by concealed carry, such as mine.	only a very small percentage of homicides are classified as self defense killings according to the fbi so it's improbable that most of these killings can be explained away as being self defense killings.
0	see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian.	(also a rhetorical question) with all of the atrocities in this country and the world, it seems so odd that politicians and those of 'religion,' as well as the public in general, are so interested in our personal lives.

The Yousef-Osama-Saddam link is a conspiracy theory.	i can't prove this but i suspect it is a lot of this information that is not widely shared and talked about that drove bush's decision to remove saddam.

1	of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever? the early church wasn't called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between. if imagination alone could generate heaven, you would be right. i have no reason to believe heaven exists. which are based on the beliefs of the early church, which you have already admitted existed during jesus's life time.	the catholic church wasn't the first church, unless you can show me that in the book of acts, or the gospels.

And yes, as the law is currently written, it does matter how large the church is. I would suggest that those that don't like it lobby to get it changed.	By that approach, as long as religion can pull in enough $$$ in revenue, they can be as entangled into government as they like.

Moreover, in Emerson the discussion of the 2nd Am. is dicta (arguments not pertinent to the verdict) so it is not a binding precedent even for the courts in the same Circuit.A question for the "original intent" crowd:What did the Founding Fathers intend with the misplaced comma in the 2nd Amendment?	the only case that I know of in which a court has ruled that the second amendment is an individual right is US vs Emerson.

You're using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant. Good try though.  Also left handed is genetic. It's not a gene but it's genetically related to the person's physical characteristics.	most of america is right handed (so it would be considered the norm), left-handed people function different than right handed people as well as behave differently in the way the go about their lives.

0	The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.	Instead they've turned everyone's attention to genes, bacteria and viruses….and this is because they know full-well that most people know nothing about these things….Thus, they assume (correctly, unfortunately) that most people will just take their word for it.

0	@ raastee: i've glanced through your paper: i'm surprised you were allowed to get away with the sentence, 'irrationalism is a fallacy to be avoided'. irrationalism is not a fallacy: a fallacy is an apparently genuine but really an illogical argument. irrationalism, outside number theory, is merely a discourse or statement inconsistent with the use of reason.	i got a 'b' for the paper and an 'a' for the class.
0	But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the "vapor canopy" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth.	While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter.
0	No. I will never allow "the people of the country" to tell me what is best for my my life or my health.To quote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice."I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	Can't choicers stop insulting the intelligence and capabilities of the people of the country and let them view the evidence and decide for themselves whether abortion harms women's health, and if it does, whether it ought to be permitted?
0	They have changed. For example, ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species, while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species (actually, two or three species).

In my post I presented several reasons as to why they should have changed...everything from a changed environment down to genetic drift.
0	Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT.	How does equal protection come into play on that equation?

0	Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are "better suited" than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there?	A population of bacteria would of course be better suited than another population if it could sense light.

Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution. Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution (along with every science) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism.	If you've noticed, I never point out the flaws in evolution to "make Creationism true."

0	Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say "What might be the best..."Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.	So restricting yourself to what you can measure can have results and should not be dismissed as "bad because all restrictions are bad".

0	So gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?We are sick of conservative family types. We are tired of the closet. The phrase "we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing.	i see a similar progression beginning in america to the point that this comment itself will be bashed by those on here whose conscience has been seared to the point that they think 2 men being married is ok.

1	yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands. It's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves.	And what you reference does not constitute a hole in TOE, although it may be a new mechanism of inheritance.

1	and a few posts later you whined about ad homs. maybe you could support that? perhaps you would prove to us that we are truly vile, evil, callous, despicable people that deserve to burn in the firey depths of hell for the murders that each and every one of us has committed? or perhaps you wouldn't.	pehaps he's matured to the point where carrying the power of life, or more significantly death over his neighbours, is not an ego-supporting experience
0	See my post above, Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument.	He could then have planted evidence that life evolved to this point.
0	I don't think people have a right to kills themselves (obviously not natural and obviously not legal right now). As for the other question, I wouldn't think a blatent disregard for the others health is morally ok.	Since you brought up the questions, I wonder what your answer would be to that second question: "Can one girl kill herself or do harmful things to her body if she chooses...even against the other heads will?"
1	by your logic, do i have to be a murdered to understand that murder is wrong? this 'walk a mile in my sandals' stuff is just bs. i don't have to be a woman to view abortion as not being moral.	so i suggest that it is very easy to say something is wrong when you cannot appreciate the fullness of the issue- a man will never be placed in the situation where they will be pregnant but do not wish to have a baby at that point.
1	My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.	The conservatives would argue that by offering same sex marriage that their persute of happiness is denied by gay people even existing and that they have to look at us.
1	I can tell that you dismissed the post below that. And I feel I can assume that you didn't read it. Odd that a paranoid conspiracy theorist / communist who concluded that communism has never led to dictatorship should accuse me of being a fanatic.	You are nothing but a troll and so I will not be bothered with you any longer.
0	How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time, as recorded by fossils?	There the remains of a dead aniomal
0	very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause	if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily.
1	More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country.	Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances.I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer.
1	nice thought. a pity you did not live in the third reich. emoticonxfrazzled if they were captured in the battlefield then they should be treated according to the geneva convention.  and if they were found in a hole then why did you remove from there? and please tell us of the 'intelligence' they supplied the only 'intelligence' they supplied was to be used in how to perfect techniques in torturing in which medical doctors participated just as the doctors in nazi germany. doctors are creepy.	see how much easier it would have been to have just shot them on the battlefield or whatever hole we found them hiding in instead of taking them into custody?
1	Oh, i thought "bullet" was some sort of slang term. Never mind.	Surely you have Microsoft Word on your computer.
0	I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.	Your position, it seems to me, turns on issues of quality of life and social justice such that children are entitled to either a minimum quality of life or none at all, and that preserving a woman's right to control over her body is necessary for her quality of life as an equal citizen.
0	i love how the creator is also just like, sure whatever .	i am happy to support your point creation effort!
0	Well, I am a parent too; three sons. So what is your point? You think I am incapable of reproducing? I have their birth certificates. emoticonXRolleyes "Bible"??? I hold Robert A. Heinland in high regard too. And Ayn Rand. And James Mitchner. And William Shakespeare. And Isaac Asimov. So what is your point?So, I should also assume you have only had sex with the intention of producing a child; in the missionary position only?????????????	I am also a person that holds the Bible in high regard.
1	But apparently they can't say no to renting the property for a gay wedding, even if they decide to just say 'no' to everyone and get out of business. go figure	No church has to marry any couple if they do not wish to do so.
0	libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual, and limited government. a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution. that's why i am surprised.	i am a libertarian because in my country, the taxes are above abnormal.
0	as compared to how they would be during a period of instability? i said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is. i'm not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on.	as to causing external instability - true it does do that, but then so does the usa.
0	Really? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird.	For the pro-life community, the issue comes down to the fact that every human being has intrinsic value and worth, and their life is valuable for its own sake
1	People make mistakes (excepting some pro-evolutionists who respond with anger and blame others of 'twisting their words'.)	They certainly tortured people at the drop of a hat however maybe they were not that upset by the heliocentric model specifically maybe it was because some people supporting the heliocentric model claimed the concept of life elsewhere.
1	Well, if you claim you can give 95% of Americans a tax cut then you'd have to be on par with Jesus.	When has anyone but a rightist extremist or a dittohead claimed messiahhood for Obama?
0	So what if he dislikes science? If he believes something else, he has the right to believe that way. My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others.	This is clearly the worst one.
1	Oh, but it does mean something to him. He can't/won't say what, but it sure isn't based on homophobia, no siree! It's just really, really important that marriage stay a striaghts only club, for reasons that can't be explained, but there's no bigotry, don't worry on that score. emoticonXRolleyes	And, since it means nothing to you anyway, you should just accept it.
0	And we all know that is what it will become. I'm willing to bet money that Marc is going to argue that abiogenesis is a part of evolution as well as the big bang. There's a clear reason why he won't accept the definitions before the debate starts.	I'm open to new definitions, but this debate should not be a debate over what atheism or evolution means.
1	Good one, Truthsayer emoticonXGood   ...a rich white woman... LOL! Gotta be from Texas. :p	Neither of the aforementioned are my "cup o' tea" so to speak but I must give credit where credit is due regardless.One other thing Whacko Jacko represents is the sheer possibilities afforded to each and every American citizen to succeed.
0	What if the surgery for transferring the embryo/fetus would be equal in difficulty, risk, etc. to having an abortion? There would then be no extra physical cost incurred in keeping the embryo/fetus alive. What would be the reasons, in such a case, to keep abortion as an option?	Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it.
1	Yes but of course was that rreally a consious choice? I see sarcasm but no real answer that is credible.......seesh if I wanted srcasm I would have watched the Orielly factor. (oh wait thats yelling and bicering) knida like politics! (oops sarcasm hehe)	any women who went through invitro and likely had 25 to who knows how many fertilized eggs destroyed must be charged by a consistant pro-lifer with child negligence.
1	A gay person is a homosexual, friend. He can't change that part about himself. He was wired that way. If you don't like the idea of gay sex, then I'd suggest you not participate in gay sex. That's pretty simple. If you don't want gay marriage, then don't get one.	I don't think gay people should be damned to Hell, put in jail, or any of that stuff.
1	Lotsa gay animals out there, man. Wonder what Jaaaman's sources are. He seems very perturbed by homosexuality.	Just a thought....Could homosexuality be the divine difference between Mankind and animals?Hmm...
0	They can if they're Catholics since Evolution is accepted doctrine now in the Church.	But they can't be true christians if they accept evolution.

1	wow, so everyone else is just wrong. no chance you could be? i am willing to bet that you also disagree with many christians or they disagree with you at least.	if you do not talk about the right god, ie, the christian god, you will spend eternity in hell.
1	i love it when hypocrites say that we are no longer old testament law but proceed to quote the old testament that they just dismissed making themselves out to be fools and hypocrites. you can not have it both ways. either the old testament applies, or it does not. also, do you play football, wear polyester, stuff like that? those are abominations too. for more abominations, read leviticus 11. damn, this is a jolly good time!	i also grabbed my bible to see what its says in context and it says nothing about temple prostitution or idolatry
0	his lies, his media darling status, my post above answers your question for you.	perhaps a better question would be asking why some people seem to hate him so much?
0	Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them.	On point, do you disagree that it should be the Navy's role to make the sea lanes safe for merchant shipping?
1	that shouldn't be too hard for an 'educated' person such as yourself to point out in the heller ruling now should it? there have been quite a few rulings post heller. did those courts let 'restrictions' stand? no!	they wouldn't have to avoid heller since heller recognized that restrictions on packing heat are okay.
1	Apparently someone doesn't read. Trebor was talking about me not being jewish in the following quote.	Or else show me in your Tanakh where they've been done away with.
0	Actually, I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only, but after reading the CBO report, I see that I wasn't far off. They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed.	Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married?
0	ez, can you cite an actual case where the aclu has intervened on behalf of nambla? the only person or persons with close associations to nambla that i can bring to mind is the notorious father paul r. shanley who molested countless children and was carefully sheltered under the wing of the notorious his eminence bernard francis cardinal law who was finally ousted from his cardinalship by a multitude of angry roman catholic parishioners in the boston area. dear his eminence bernard francis cardinal law was immediately taken and sheltered under the wing of the vatican and scooted over the pond to several administrative posts of the roman curia, where he was also named as archpriest of the basilica di santa maria maggiore, one of the five major basilicas of the roman catholic church.	and you and the aclu want to protect that kind of morally and legally reprehensible 'speech'?
0	Well... someone hasn't been following the campaigns for the so-called "protection of marriage" amendments, federal or state.	This has nothing to do with religion whatsoever.
0	i've been following the story here all afternoon bbs. i'm sorry that you're going through this, but what has scotland done to upset radical islam ? nothing that i know of. could it be they have declared war on the west in general and as a whole ? i mean, i have been told over and over again how these radical moslems are just confused souls and the real enemies we must fear are the radical conservative christians like me who actually pray for the unsaved. talk about scary people, huh ?	my mother said i was crazy to fly, but the way i see it is if we live in fear to go about our daily business than these people have won
1	Someone once said that the poor would always be with us.   I'll keep in mind that your core beliefs include the notion that what the poor really need is a hard day's work. You're a prophet I tell ya!	It makes perfect sense if that is where his core beliefs are.
0	I believe it is merely all known living species against those known by the fossil record and extinct. There are undoubtedly more extinct species that we are unaware of than living ones.	I read an article yesterday (about Evolution, Extinction, and Economics) in which it was claimed that 99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct.This sort of claim (which I've come across before) troubles me: how can it be asserted, with any certainty at all:1).
0	Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory.	We supposedly evolved from simplistic monkeys to what we are today.
0	But it, along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis, is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis. Actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is.	and nobody has ever managed to do so (though the concept of an invisible man in the sky is a little silly).
1	Why is it that people don't want to admit that it was Bush's' reckless spending on a War that we didn't need , the tax cuts for the richest 2 % of America, The Fact that under Bush they had to ADD space on the Debt clock, not to mention that he was as dumb as a rock, yet they can place all this blame on Obama who inherited this mess and has done more to get us out of it than Bush or any Republican would have done. Unemployment is High, we know this, but it was on it's way up when Obama took over because under Bush more corporations left this country , more businesses closed down, the Banks were allowed to do whatever they wanted without regulation of any kind, and yet none of it is his fault?.. Enlighten me...	And New York's assembly has been run by Democrats since at least the 1950s.

0	If there is a positive relationship between drug consumption and crime, it doesn`t seem very likely that crime would go down as a result of lowering the price on drugs (and thus rasing consumption).	I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain.
1	Yeah parents like these?...Westboro Baptist Church family disowns daughter ? 20/20 - YouTubeChristian Nutters is what I like to call them..	most any parent (except a bad parent) is going to love their kid no matter what and most people aren't evil gay-haters after all.
0	Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?	Perhaps another unwanted child spending a childhood is state supported homes?
1	How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.	And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe, then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence?

0	I suppose the fact that Indian law only applies to its people. Who qualifies as an Indian is another matter.

0	why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom.	You could also say that violent killers and serial rapists are being discriminated against for "who they are."

0	and how do you know?? let's see evidence of this. or, it is just one of your proclamations?? that statement says to me 'i can close my eyes to all evidence, all common sense, because i believe in god'.	in the eyes of god, what you describe as supernatural, is not.
1	i love it when straight, christian folk who disapprove of gays seem to know so much about what it is to be gay - how it feels, how they became that way, the nature of their relationships and whether or not its something they can control. hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to. emoticonxrolleyes	that's what you do best.
0	we do? how do we know that? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link, but i am unaware of proof that there is no link. did i miss something?	but when it must be done under the guise of false science, there is a problem from what ive seen, homosexuality, and sexuality on a whole, is indeed a complex issue.
0	Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either.	It's pathetic, really.....yet all you anti-intellectuals will soak it up like a sponge.

1	And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.	And I would appreiciate your refraining from calling the Bible mythology.
0	It's thanks to the opposers of the theory that all this rubbish about descending from monkeys and slimeball came about, all ppl need is a bit more education and things should become clearer.	What we didn't do is evolve from any apes still living today, but our common ancestors with those apes were themselves apes.
0	Well, I forgot to add one thing: a legal notice to the gov't about such behavior.	so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?
0	My mom can only trace her family back a few generations. By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century, the records get very confusing and very incomplete. By creationist logic, we must then accept that my ancestors, white Americans, were specially created in North America by God.	And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years.
0	Well, not completely, but yes, quite the same. However, this is irrelivent- she wasn't a person, because she was in a coma. Does that give me the right to kill her? Of course not!   What about fetuses born in comas? Can we kill them?   What about people in vegetative states? After all, they arn't perfect, so let's kill them!	do you believe that if her mind was transported to another person that she would still be in her body and not in her mind?
0	Dealing with a designated nuisance species isn't the same thing as hunting. It's wildlife management.	Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?
1	However, we do give people alcohol, there are many people who drink it on a regular basis who are not addicts. What do these substances you mention have to do with being gay? Would it perhaps be okay for me to have homosexuality on the weekends or after work during happy hour?	So if a drug addict, or an alcoholic stands up and says, "God made me this way", should we accept that fact, and give them drugs or alcohol.
0	So, I guess you didn't get the memo that this country was FOUNDED on Christian/Judaic beliefs. Remember: You do have rights; to an extent.	I believe that if marriage is offered to heteros, and they seem to think it is their right to get married, then marriage must be extended equally to gay people.

1	Was she on her knees, taking lessons from you...or was she skilled already?	Dont forget my daughter...they had a video of naked men behind the bar too.We all thought it was funny.Some homosexuals seem quite nice...not grizzled old queens like some:)
0	But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent.	<snip of silly, irrelevant religious claptrap> Creation is not a necessity, but I have yet to see substantial evidence to disprove it.
0	If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it.	Those quotes have nothing to do with abortion.
1	Have some cheese with your whine, turkey?  Who is the liar? It is the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is an antichrist. 1 John 2:22  That would be you and those like you. Repent, you heathen!	if you are right about your god, you're going to be satan's number one hot-poker puppet.
0	Well, first, those were Hebrews, not Christians. Secondly, the scripture doesn't say they raped them, it says "keep them for yourselves." That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention. Also, the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men, so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small. However, that DOESN'T mean it was justified or right.	Also, if the Christian worldview is against rape, why does Moses say that Yahweh allows the Israelites to take the virgin children of the Midianites captive to do with what they would in Numbers 31?
0	Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis.	The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission.
1	do you actually believe that? do you have any evidence? complaining is practically the national passtime here.	go over to britain or canada where they have whatever you could possibly want in terms of social policy...except for the right to question the government and complain about the quality of living.

0	Oh, I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I'm completely for it.	ICBM, but this won't affect abortion issues.It's only recently that the Democrats have used the filibuster to delay the vote on appointed judges.I don't think there's any possibility of getting rid of filibusters all together.BTW, what's wrong with a pro-life court?
0	In 2000, the U.S. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides. The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25% higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year. In Japan, the number was 22.sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan.	How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year?
1	That may seem like a brainstorm to you kronus, but to the enlightened, it was an obvious brainfart. emoticonXGood But I would never expect you to know the difference.	What if they're just books written by people!Wow, how could no one have ever thought of that before!
1	Considering what you turkeys did to the State of California, with its budget and social depravity, you have no room to talk. I'm surprised the Lord hasn't cast San Francisco and L.A. into the Pacific Ocean yet.

1	Well if no siege comes, I guess no harm no foul.	With 250 million guns owned in the U.S. today -- it's as if we're permanently awaiting a siege that will never come -- there's simply no hope of eradicating arms from the American equation.

0	No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution.	But are the mutated fish really a different species or are they merely a race, like humans with different skin colors?
1	Said like a lazy, ignorant person who would rather live off the sweat of others than go out and earn for himself.	Said like a cruel evil person who has no concern for his fellow man.
1	So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.	Atheists are clearly capable of all of these, but if human beings are just collections of bones, blood and tissue, what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them?

To bad they couldn't work the same magic on their next Republican President.Maybe Clinton better understood the downside of deficit spending and its effect on future generations.
1	Hehehe. Sounds like an American in a big SUV looking at $4/gallon gasoline with a maxed out credit card listening to fundamentalist talk radio.	Think of the flexibility the US has in regards to budgets with a higher debt load eating more of the budget in service costs.
1	And the scientific papers don't. The problem here is that creationists don't read the scientific papers. In fact, most can't even understand them.	Evolution is supposed to be science, and is said to not address religion.
1	Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?	If you were to ask ronound economists of today like Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (from the book Capitalism) they would disagree with this standard textbook answer.
1	Haaa Haaa Haaa Haaa haaa haaa haaa haaa Thats a good one not. emoticonXClown	Now if I could just convince you to vote for Bush....
0	Yep - that's someting that many "pro-lifers" also never take into account.	I am happy though that you did take more than reasonable precautions to prevent pregnancy in the 1st place.
1	is it only the spiritually blind that can see guys like this for what they really are? rip preacher.	i'm not pitching my tent in your backyard!
0	And we know this how? You complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this?Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?	Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States!
0	Not at all. The theory of evolution contains many many things.	It seems...misleading the way you try to broaden the tautology of one phrase, to all of evolution, as seen in your statement "evolution contains tautology".
1	And ill continue to have pity for abused and unplanned pregnant women lacking basic healthcare.	I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible "lovers" out there.
1	Man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form. Did we invent the wheel, or discover the idea? Did the Wright brothers invent machine powered flight, or was it that they stumbled upon it? In every culture, in every society, man looks to something greater than himself. They simple don't leave it at themselves and be done with it.	That our emotions are imperfect versions of his.Of course I would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable.
0	Why are you dishonest enough to claim that you aren't trying to get YEC into the schools.	In fact, it is in contrast to generally accepted biological rules (life does NOT come from nonliving matter).
1	How many suicide bombers have you herard of wearing a cross? You're assertion is absurd...as usual.	You mean there is a difference between muslim and christian extreamists?
1	No, I have no idea. He didn't build the Bush Library as Marc Rich did to get a pardon from Clinton, did he?	JP do you know what Lay did for Bush and his Dad?
1	I'm sure the response is that He could. But, y'know, God's a real XXX sometimes... (Besides, who do you think used His uber-complex biochemical engineering skills to create the prions responsible for FFI, anyway?)	My personal answer would be that if god is truly omnipotent, he could eliminate many causes of unhappiness without causing suffering.
0	14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol.	the minimum drinking age should be lowered to 14 if not 12. the main problem with alcohol is drinking habits, non-safe drinking habits are encouraged by a high age of license due to how alcohol is more likely to be consumed in bulk and away from proper supervision for those underage.
0	In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole "let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it" mentality....	How and why do you think the terms have changed, and what are the similarities between tham?

0	Yet according to PP themselves, they provide FAR more abortions and EC services than any of their other services. :PPPFA Services (2002-2003)Surgical abortions: 227,385 Emergency contraception: 633,756 Prenatal care: 15,860 Adoption referrals: 1,963 (Source: www.plannedparenthood.org)	They do provide many more services than providing abortions :P
1	I'd be curious if Berkowitz studied whether a sword or club produced the same effect as a firearm?   Short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty, I'm afraid boys will be boys.	"Researchers from Knox College find that male college students who held a gun rather than a child's toy for 15 minutes had elevated levels of testosterone and added three times as much hot sauce to a glass of water that another test subject subsequently had to drink.
1	1868 actually, that is a link to the wikipedia article on the act. once again, the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 are not the same thing. more importantly, a store saying 'no blacks allowed' is not violating the 14th, they violate the civil rights act of 1964. furthermore, a store saying 'no guns allowed' is not violated the 2nd amendment.  time for you to read up on the constitution doc, you might find some good things in there. i'm a little surprised you don't vote democrat given your thoughts. then again, not much difference between a given democrat and your texas 'republicans' (see w bush and rick perry)	here is the enforcement provisions of the act of 1964: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_rights_act_of_1964 heller ruled that the 2a was about more than 'discrimination on gun laws' in that as long as the 'discrimination was equal it would be legal according to the plaintiffs and muncipalities'.
0	This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.	We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence.
1	Examined the record? Now it's not even the patient, just the record? Good god man! Many times, only a number of criteria must be met, not all of them. It would be like me saying that there must be gas in your car since it is running. Then you tell me that I must look at the gauge then physically take the tank off to be able to say without a doubt there is gas in it. Flat EEG in the cerebral cortex means no brain activity in cerebral cortex means PVS. There is no reason to test a swallowing reflex, a pain response reflex, or sphincter tone.	The doctor is supposed to be quite an eminent member of his filed of study and may actually know what he is talking about.
1	i'm surprised archangel hasn't jumped on this.  he's gullible enough to fall for tv props, why not this?	those making this absurd claim of foreign birth are likely uncomfortable with their president having an arabic name and maybe his african heritage as well.
1	Really. If that's being "saved," I prefer to go down with the Titanic.	It's not up to you to " Save" anyone.. As far as I'm concerned you can keep your imaginary salvation...
0	Everyone expects that. What they don't and shouldn't have to expect is that they will be specifically targeted and have to pay more, be penalised more, etc. than hetero couples such as yourself or me and my husband.	If you want Homosexual Marriage, be prepared to shell out more $$$ when Uncle Sam comes to collect when, in the inevitability,you should call it splitsville.
0	Yes, the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite. The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe, the Roman, of course, being the largest. The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite, and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.East to West, a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church, especially those of the east.Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?	Like the Maronite Church they practice Eastern Rites as Orthodox do, but they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.

1	I thought it was at the bottom of a large body of water.	A good gun to an anti gunner is a single shot firearm that is inaccurate and shoots nerf bullets.
1	So, faith and argument from incredulity.   If you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. Then maybe an actual scientist could take over.  Major in molecular biology? Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.	secondly, throughout my college education (majoring in molecular biology) i have observed the complexities of the single-cell, and find it impossible to believe that it occurred by accident (though that may not be the best choice of words).
0	Because of the history of it. Well, ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state'. Let's just say that I.D. is an attempt to teach Creationism in school.	Incidentally, is the title of this forum meant to imply that creationism and Intelligent Design are two names for the same thing?
0	And there are plenty of people who smoke who don't develop lung cancer. You're cherry picking.	There are plenty of people who have constant access to firearms, and yet never display violent tendencies.
0	Oh no, I completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is. Your continuing to compare the ID concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more. That and the fact that you referred to the flying spaghetti monster seven times in your last post.	You completely miss the point here.
0	Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: "a revolution". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!	He may as well say race issues will be decided by elected representatives the racial balance necessary in their own communities"He is completely dishonest and knows full well that this is a Republic based on the Law of the Land, The Constitution and not a democracy as he suggests.
0	Well then quit trolling, and start debunking the BS by providing links to cases that were solved by having a gun registry in place.	Cat crapola and bunches of stuff like that!
1	Our pumping of CO2 is certaintly not helping. Does that mean we should pump gasses and make people in big cities sneeze?	The planet is hotter than it's ever been before because we continue to pump CO2 into the air.
1	I can't believe that you would attempt to make such an insane assertion. Clearly, God was speaking about homosexual sex, but I'm not surprised that you left out the most unambiguous scriptural references. emoticonXRolleyes	17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.

1	You will soon learn, my friend, that fundies have very, very short memories when it comes to refutations of their arguments...	But we have gone over it, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem in this thread.
0	I think that case was in Georgia (a different state) and so far as I know homosexuality was not involved. However if you want to worry about a legal case you need to look at Dover Pa. Not the sticker case in Cobb County.	No, that is because the courts let the Darwiniacs win in Alabama and not let the stickers be put in the books.
0	I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though.	The reason for having a gun is as you stated - to stop the crime once it has begun (though this may prevent a worse crime from occurring).
0	i would never limit myself in a debate to 'how many' generations it takes because the fact is your scientists are afraid to test such things. in the following example it took between 7 and 18 generations for guppies to change their phenotypes. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...sss-270397.php of course these guys, being evolutionsts explain this phenomenon as happening through natural selection -- death. but what have we already learned about tadpoles?? -- they develop in direct relation to their predators....including body structure. fish are no different.	on the iidb board, you insisted that if an animal was transplanted to a different environment, you would expect it's phenotype to change in response to that environment within 'a few' generations.
0	It went out the window with the passage of the "Partiot Act".I said that I did not expect Robertson to be charged, did I not? However, I am not a lawyer nor that familar with the "Patriot Act". It is conceivable that he could be charged. I don't really know. But even if he COULD be charged, I certainly would not expect to see it.	The day that I have to start worrying about the USA extraditing me to a foreign country because I advocated the death of a Castro wannabe, I'll renounce my US citizenship and move to Canada.

0	Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view.	The best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all.
0	And how would Bush look if his own people hated him so much that they revolted? That would be very bad publicity, and quite an embarrassment that I wouldn't want as a country leader.	Your hypothetical is just that - hypothetical.
0	but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage.	you can argue in other ways, on other basis, but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty 'argument'.
1	Well Duh!   The answer has ALWAYS BEEN Drugs, and Drug Traffickers. Concentrate on them and you have the answer to the problems!

1	Oops, my bad. You're right of course. Port is an interface on a computer. It's also a harbour, so you're wrong too! :P	Port is neither a direction in which a ship captain can steer his ship, nor is it even a location to which he can steer his ship in order to dock.

1	this seems like a begging the question fallacy. lets just assume that they 'do not' have control over it...it would be the same thing for an alcoholic (which people are also born with). are you saying alcoholics should be allowed to live in this lifestyle? i guess it is societies fault emoticonxrolleyes looks like jyoshu's reactions were correct for you i am pretty surprised no one is like 'yeah, this is still a problem'..instead they are going '25%...that aint too bad'. even worse, they blame other people. in fact, robbie says gay men are acting 'recklessly' because they aren't treated as 'normal', yet he believes that gay men are ready to have families. how can you be reckless yet be ready for a family?..or rather, a good family?	la is probably too librul for you to trust, too, so you may just have to google and see if fox covered the decrease in rates.
0	Not realy they are still being manufactured for civilian use and are legal in most states even in states where machine guns are not allowed. You would be actualy supprised at how available they are. You sign your life away and are no longer a name less face to the feds but you may be able to own one in your state. All thats needed is to get your chief law enforcment officer to sign your fourm 4, pay $200 to BATFE, pass an FBI back ground chk and wait appx. 2 mo's and you have one.	that silencer would make it illegal for most everyone to own.
0	did he? what secular evidence do you have from before 70 c.e. that confirms his existance? what is the outside verification to the new testament?	what about the fact that scientific information allways changes to suit what is observed.
1	Oh he won't read that... This American in exile (does not even live here anymore) just disappears for a while whe the heat is on only to resurface with his same propaganda after the heat has died down.	It's been widely reported, even on liberal-run media, that states with 'conceal carry laws' have had a reduction in overall crime and more dramatic reductions in specific crimes like murder, etc.Myself, I don't worry with providing 'raw data' for lazy liberals who won't be swayed in their rabid hatred of 'gun ownership' anyway.
1	i am none too surprised to see that the point was totally and utterly lost on you.	you said that re: the trojan war.
0	Yes, but if seen from space (something the ancients couldn't do) it LOOKS like it hangs on nothing. Don't worry, I don't mind spelling it out for you.	How did you get that analysis from that scripture?
0	Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.	"The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state.
1	look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice.	[url='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_related_attacks'] and yet us school killings account for more deaths in this list than the rest of the world put together (counting like-for-like situations, not rebel military actions such as in vietnam, pakistan or russia).
1	oh yes. that's why the brits took fast and sure measures to round up the islamofascist jerks. wish we could do the same here, oh yes, i almost forgot.we are!!	the ira have been failing at it for decades, some crazy extremists aren't going to do much better.
1	Perhaps some people here aren't on the same level of intelligence. Seems you and chester understand it now so that is good.	It wouldn't need a translation if it was clear from the outset.
0	Yet he hasn't. No pro-choice person I know wants abortion to be prevalent, they just want it to be an option. Wanting it safe and rare and available is not an abnormal positon for a pro-choice person.	So what if he changed his mind or whatever.
1	The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot.	you could probably start by not calling the majority of people anti-moral, anti-family, anti-equality, anti-American, homophobes.
1	And that's why I think you are a troll. There really aren't any experts here. There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind.	I would appreciate it if some of you experts could give me some simple answers to a couple simple questions and help me with some of my doubts.
1	So then will you go the way on liberty (repeal stoopid laws) or tyranny (enact more unconstitutional laws)?	So does this mean they have to get tougher on gun control or softer before the results go their way?
1	I guess it's a good thing I wasn't replying and/or talking to you then. But thanks for your input, it has been noted.	No, Steeeeeeeeeeeeve, I don't see what you mean.
1	uhm, you do realize that humans and chimps are not the same things as dogs, cats, horses, and sharks ... right?  i am under no obligation to address the evolutionary origin every possible organism. let's review the facts. 1) i said there is a ton of evidence for macroevolution, and there is.  2) i gave a specific example, saying that i could provide multipe lines of independent evidence supporting the fact that humans and chipms share a common evolutionary ancestor. and i can.	tell me, what did a cat evolve from?
1	Rants? Obsessive-compulsive? How so? I don't insult you with every post as you do me? What's you major problem? Perhaps you need to go pray.	If you want I could reciprocate by pointing out how obsessive-compulsive your rants are.
1	so now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?  i expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? am i to believe that you are a soldier there now?  your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. i posted exactly what i meant to and you went off on a tangent. i asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if 'show me yours before i show mine?' pitiful.	if you claim that a fetus is a life, what does it matter what type of life it is?
1	All the more reason to be armed to the teeth huh,does this mean you see it our way?	There might be even more such attacks in the US if the US shared a border with Pakistan.
1	So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.	I have already asked God for forgiveness and he has forgiven me.
1	Indeed true. God created man in his own likeness and man returned the favor. Man created a vindictive, vengeful, and vicious god, according to the Bible. So where does a loving god come from?	Easily understood when man created his own god.
0	which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation.	so says the offspring of islam.....still wrong but vehement in his certitude.
0	Actually in high school I had a friend who used to be in placement. He was sixteen years old an he said he got the s*** beat out of him by an eight year old boy. "Street kids" get their XXX beat every day, pain is nothing new to them. It seems they're immune to it. It doesn't matter how hard you can hit, if you can't take a punch, then you can't call yourself street-worthy.	"Boys and girls as young as 10", the story says.They threw "rocks and eggs" at her house.They don't kill you for that in England, Texas maybe.
1	My thoughts are my own, not from some 2000 year old Book that makes as much sense as a bag of Rocks. And I have only ever called anyone a name in response to an attack on me,   If you call what you have been doing debating then I see what the problem really is.	I really don't feel the need to respond to the names you mooks end up calling me since I know my place in eternity, so have at it for all I care.
0	Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?   I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.	this is the vpc they claim to be for 'moderate gun control laws' they used to be hci.

0	dear terry here, please see my post on the other side of this debate. you may think that nothing happens after you argue a debate, but that is just the start. so much more happens after a debate is created and argued. people around the world look at the debates and learn from them, make decisions because of them and create additional debates. your input can change the world. andy	but after we debate , nothing happens right?
1	Seems all the drills would broadcast when they had a leftie. Just could wait for that case of M-1 thumb or the hot one down the shirt.	But seriously that gun was such a treat it's so simple to clean, reliable and accurate in the right hands.No wonder the military is having such a pain trying to find a successor....
1	You mean your hypothetical I presume? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal.   You're a bit slow I see.	oh brother.. so what if a minority of americans wanted to legalize murder.this is rediculous.
1	Only if you include the fact that while cleaning up the water he is beating the pipe with a hammer.	", you should know that it falls in the category of A.
1	It is also enough for me to realize you people are using words without definitions.	This is enough for me to realize that you do not understand what you are talking about.
0	**True, and the confusion was my bad, as explained already. However, the fact of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, as demonstrated by Ames and by Cairns, still shoots great big holes in the darwinist assumptions arising out of your old war-horses, Luria & Delbruck '43, and its "clone", Lederberg and Lederberg '52.	However, all of that is quite beside the point in the case under discussion.
0	Oh I can easily spend $1,000 dollars an hour. If I could I would also have plenty of reason to live to be 114.	I ran some numbers and here is what I came up with....If you had 1 billion dollars, and you spent $1,000 an hour.
0	Do you? Care about gay people, that is. You keep imply that it's only their tactics you don't like, but I can't recall you ever saying that you support a persons right to be gay. So please, cards on the table. Do you support a person's right to have sex with whatever willing adult they choose? No politics, no tactics. Please, just answer that simple question.	He doesn't understand that people can disagree with gay peoples' behavior and still care about gay people.
1	ok, fine, you can use that line, but there is also a moajority that believes in other things. there's this crazy thing, called a choice. we all have that. remember? i made the choice to have sex, you're making the choice to be a total ***hole. we all make a decision, and its the strong ones that stick with them, even though there are others who dont believe the same thing.	Yet mine is right....well it isn't really mine, it is the majorities.

0	The whole "change the definition of marriage" is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots. They don't seem to realize that words can have several meanings.	Those who object to same-sex marriage primarily (or so they claim) because it would "change the definition of marriage" should perhaps be made aware that that train has already left the station:Merriam-Webster On-line http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/marriage Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage Encarta http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/featur...fid=1861628509 American Heritage http://www.bartleby.com/61/2/M0120200.html This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.
1	let's look up all the definitions, shall we? here's where you got 'yours': as you can see, the definition you cited is only used once, and even then it is just one of two from that source.  i notice you ignored all of the responses to you on the thread and decide to just post this piece of work without answering people. we are waiting, oh sentient one. we have shown you creatures that match all of these definitions (or at least all of the definitions that are seen in each and every source - see how alike each one is?) - now show us how humans are the only sentient beings in the universe.	or are you dr. dolittle?

0	From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo...w/26satel.htmlHmmm, Teddy Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, the Rockefeller foundations, millions of Americans, the State of Indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS.Interesting, yes?	Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the "germ-plasm" of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated.
0	You say you cannot see it from the gay perspective, then you speak from that perspective as a gay man. This is confusing. As a heterosexual, if you are one, would you give up those rights and let gays have the rights?	Apparently, you have five questions.If by 'ability for inward perspective' you imply the ability to look at one's self, it is incongruent to say you are leary of our ability 'to think of life from a gay perspective'.
0	You bring up a very interesting point.   All those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well. When polled, residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions.   So, not only are the anti's disingenuous as far as what they promoted, but were so in HOW these amendments were promoted.	The authors of all those constitutional amendments ensured that there were no recognition of any other types of relationships in their wording.Why should any of us settle for something that these very same people are going to attempt to deny anyway?
1	It is only difficult to sort out if you are a neocon and fail to recognize that neocons are nothing but militant liberals.   Bush was BY FAR the most liberal president we have had for at least 20 years.   Maybe you need to research traditional conservative values.	Not at all, it's just that other posters that often agree with you in just about every way want to call themselves conservatives (they've called Clinton a conservative, Bush a liberal, etc.)
0	This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.	Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage?

0	Actually you are incorrect. The most commonly used rifles on the competition circuit are so-called "assault weapons".The "assault weapon" moniker is a term just recently fashioned to describe a military looking weapon.There are several target competitions designed solely for these types of rifles.	this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.

1	Well, you must not be a GOP lawmaker or the President of the United States. They're convinced that the only way to prevent the SCOTUS finding in favor of same-sex marriage is to amend the Constitution.	I see no way the federal government can force states to marry gays.
0	Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality. My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say "Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this..."But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?	Have you read Leveticus?

0	Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by "friction".By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation.	It is not a mutation.
1	that was a cheap shot my friend.. lets keep at around an a*d*u*l*t level.. shall we?	I guess our little 14-year-old was humiliated beyond belief and decided it was best to not even try to respond to tons of evidence that refuted his/her "evidences".
1	so what is it that isn't true? are you saying nasa didn't spend 12 billion dollars developing a zero gravity pen or that russia didn't use a pencil? and since you're so anal about a simple joke, go ahead and support your claim that anything my joke says isn't true, with actual evidence. your opinion doesn't carry much weight with me.	the last thing you need in a spacecraft is powdered graphite from a pencil drifting onto electrical contacts.
1	Odd. I can't seem to find any racial slurs or racist ideology in those sentences. In fact, I don't see any race or races in general even mentioned. You're just one of those people who thinks you can win a discussion by accusing your opponents of being racist. Sorry simone, but in the real world, people can disagree with your leftist views (which are barely existent) without being racist.	When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work, because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is the beginning of the end of any nation.
0	reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary 'defense' nuclear weapon parity with russia. considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq, i'm surprised our conceit hasn't made all of me and asia scramble for nukes. pakistan, 97% muslim, hides bin laden, governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts, never a bad word about that us 'ally'. but they have nukes and delivery systems. i'd think iran believes, as we've shown, that the us doesn't spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons.	they are not going to use nukes as offensive weapons if it is going to ensure their own destruction in retaliation.

0	Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out.       Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?	I know of no one that is pro life believes the mother should die so the baby can live.
0	I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people.	Government is violence.

1	So if I go out and buy a Brand X car and then regret it a year later, does that mean that nobody should be allowed to go out and buy a Brand X car? Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive? Sounds kinda fascist to me.	If it's really no big deal, then why would they feel that way?
1	I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above.	Ok, let's give that a try.Evolution doesn't require something to have evolved from nothing, so this isn't a valid criticism.

0	You contradict yourself. If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis.	I believe that God made the Earth only a few thousand years ago, not that much geographically different from the way it is now.
0	NOt true,California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal.	Well, of course the issue isn't "limiting" marriage, but rather making it more open-ended.
1	so a vote for an adulterous divorcee is a vote for morality? is this election being held in wonderland? i'm pretty sure mccain falls foul on bearing false witness as well.	a vote for mccain is a vote for democracy.
0	So if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence, and a devout Christian believes God is the highest form of intelligence, the Christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence?	One may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith, but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith, and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people (usually with the subclause of "Let them burn in hell afterwards", or something else along those lines).

0	Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you "view humanity with mental existance as important" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood.	The only ones you are protecting that our view does not are those human living entities with no mental existence.
1	Tell me, how does one "steal land" from a nomad? emoticonXConfused	But it's fair to say you just insulted a number of people of faith, who donot follow Christianity, only.

If you think that the C(R)SC actually does ID-based scientific research, you're exactly the dupe they're looking for.I'm serious. Do the research for yourself. I won't even give you links, because you'll XXXX them off as propaganda. Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID. I dare you.	Or is it killing you that i would donate money to an organization that opposes your secular humanist agenda so you feel you must lash out like an angry child?
1	So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves.

0	take another look. we certainly do have our hands firmly on the levers of power. sixty us senators, a substantial majority in the house, a president who represents the death of reaganism once and for all. a solidly pro-choice president and congress. a president and a congress who understand that each of us is responsible for all the rest of us. oh yes, this country will emerge from the bush depression and the optional bush wars with a new sense of direction and a new prosperity. by the next election, there will be so few congressional republicans that they can caucus in the mens' room - provided, of course, that larry craig has not returned for a visit and is using it for other purposes. the naysayers can either get on the train or get left at the station.emoticonxsmilie	you're nothing but a sad dupe for the people that have bought and paid for the white house.
0	I'm not trying to participate in gang debate, but well..The population of "people with heart trouble" would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce. If reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off.	That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.
1	So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about.	Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch.
0	oh yes, president obama also has to figure out how to get rid of the bush policy of lies and falseness bush people burrowed into the federal government by bush during his last days as president in order to thwart the spread of science, research and reality.	but of course, if it happens after president obama has his people installed, people who believe in science and research and reality, and these reality-oriented people have taken full control of the agencies who oversee these sorts of things and have made sure that regular inspections are made for food safety.
0	Schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.	But you haven't rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause?ALITO: Well, what you have pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up, and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through.SCHUMER: You didn't think that through in 1985?ALITO: I was not involved in...SCHUMER: When you wrote the statement.
0	But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.	And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle.
1	i must be blessed to be surrounded by so many posters with a direct line to god so that they know who is saved or in hell. with christians as well-informed as this, i'm surprised god doesn't just retire and let them take over. after all, 6,000 years since creation must be enough for anyone.	that is not for us to say.

1	So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women?	People have to start clearing the closet... so to speak, and simply be down to earth and accept that not all your decisions are going to be popular ones, and homosexuality is one of them - and you certainly don't win fans by thinking you can leverage the guilt game on people even thinking you can draw comparisons between color [innate] and sexual preference [choice] as a basis for some perceived civil right, it is just plain and utter nonsense.
0	And if you rewind a little over 40 years, the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage.Archie's reply is a non-argument, and false at that.Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage, but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage.Little things like child rape, lack of consent, and other issues.	The reason that's the case is because there are many limitations on marriage but only homosexuals claim they are being discriminated against.

1	who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation? how od you know they are right? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation?  perhaps, as the roman elite at the time claimed, the bible was compiled, and christianity was heavily pushed, primarily as a method of controlling the people. we know the bible was heavily edited. we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured, and not by the folks claimed. isn't literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea?	yes there is poetry and symbolism, but there are also places for literal interpretation.

But it is only allowed under restricted prescription (it's a Schedule II controlled substance, the same as morphine or cocaine) and is far less effective than plant-derived THC.

The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences. I know plenty of people who don't believe in any sort of God and aren't bothered by the thought that this is all they have, the only life they'll ever live.

0	You are missing the entire point (again). Why do you feel ashamed? Because you know that what you did is bad. I have heard from a great Australian war hero, one of our remaining ANZACs soliders (recently passed away I think) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun (WWI era) and he saw him die that it was "the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure". He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life. He knows that he did something wrong, but it was a war, and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen. You are way off the plot. But let us continue.	Because your mommy and daddy told you "no, no, no" when you did something wrong.

0	Just to contribute, I'm pro-gun, have had training in the proper use and laws in my area, and have owned weapons for more than 30 years.	While I am not a huge fan of polls, one of the positions often held by those of us on the pro gun side of the debate is that those in favor of stricter firearms law, are not familiar with firearms or current firearms law.I would be interested to know what level of knowledge is possessed by both sides of the argument.
0	Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.	I am just having trouble reconciling the idea of removing a fundamental right based on a misdemeanor conviction and was wondering if there is similar precedent elsewhere.
0	If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?	Whether the fetus is human is not something that I think is really relevant to the matter, and in any case where we give it the benefit of the doubt it is still permissable to carry out abortions in order to safeguard a woman's autonomy.
1	You see, that's the problem: "generally". You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country.	It's hard for me to believe that people in your movement don't know that generally, people's view on a political/ideological issue is a different matter than whether or not they would save their life or help them.
1	Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.	since you asked the question again, ill answer again <snip>stuff about us being in a democratic system</snip> as a christian, if a legal matter is being contested, and you want to oppose it, you are certainly welcome to do so.
0	i think that would probably create more problems than it would solve. how would we know? we don't punish. drunk drivers get off incredibly easy so much of the time. we have the weakest anti-drunk driving laws in the western world and we have the worst problem with drunk driving. coincidence? that's not all that far from what i've said. @joe- this is for a whole other discussion, but i think that the first step in aa is a big part of the reason of its low success rate. that's not too far from what i've said either.	just privatise the road system and let the owners set the rules for drunkeness, it's the only fair way to do it.
0	to be honest with you, i'm mildly amused at best.	you obviously either fail to understand the argument being presented, or you now understand it and don't want to admit to your previous folly.
1	do you actually think that asking worthless questions will help your side? oh wait, obviously you do, that's all you ever ask. why are you trying so hard to deny the fact that conception originates a new organism?  irrelevant  that conception is the beginning of that new organism's life and physical existence? irrelevant that conception is in that respect, the birth of a new organism?  my definition does not allow for this conclusion. why does that fact bother you so much? if you are right, then all words are worthless and meaningless. if you are right every word means every other word.	why are you trying so hard to deny the fact that conception originates a new organism?
1	Yippie doo! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view. And his point of view has (or had) merit. But since then, several feathered dinosaurs (not birds) have been found. It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation. (You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a "point mutation" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation.	Well, here's another quote from Allan Feduucia:"Feathers are unique to birds, and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified."
0	And those pillars will be replaced by something stronger like equality and Justice.	If we allow marriage to be redefined to include same-sex couples, the Twin Pilllars of Morality and Spirituality (which have served as beacons of the American culture since our beginning) will not stand.
0	humans don't just have sex for procreation. humans have sex for pleasure. that explains the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerves underneath the head of the penis.	the fact of the matter is, however, that homosexual relationships, themselves, appear to have no positive evolutionary purpose.
1	hey, archangel, i notice you didn't respond to the points i made - no argument, huh? to quote jyoshu: 'well since you didn't address my points, i'll assume you're done! a simple 'ok, i concede that ... and moving on back to the issues ...' ***jyoshu well, everyone, looks like our ez/ss clone has finally realized his argument was wrong.	plain and simple, you have no idea what your talking about regarding the bible or spiritual topics so i'm wasting my time trying to reason with the likes of you in any case.
1	So AIDS is the fault of "the gays"?emoticonXRolleyes   lol it's been a long time, JP.	While AIDS can be spread through heterosexual sex, I stated that it was homosexual sex that put AIDS over the critical mass needed to perpetuate and spread.
0	No it's not. Perhaps because you don't understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with ID. ID is not science and has no evidence to support it.	I don't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID.
0	YES! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed. With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild (as england did). They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote. Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system.	Does this mean that the found fathers of America realised that they were not to be trusted?
0	you seem to be lost in our jokes, you have to tell people you're joking so they know. and you got the punctuation wrong, in the russian phrase. the only way for it not to sound insane in russian, would be to put it as: '___ _ __. __'. calling someone '__', means things are serious, and you're ready for a fight. if you claim it to be a joke, you're just insane. so i assume that you got the punctuation wrong, and it was your signature.	i didn't say it was making me hungry.
0	I know of at least 3 personally, including my brother. He fought for custody for years and it nearly bankrupted him. He was trying to get his kids away from an ex-wife that would go away with her boyfriend for weekends at a time and leave their 15 year old daughter in charge of threee younger siblings.	How many men who are single fathers and take sole responiblity for thier children because the women refuses to do so will you find if you go looking?
1	What part of the Christian worldview? A part of the Christian worldview says stealing is wrong, so you must mean stealing is good? A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong, so you must mean rape is good? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong, so you must mean sexual immorality is good?	At least from my studying it seems that the Christian worldview is not correct in any way, shape or form.
1	You can start your own thread on how historical the Gospel accounts, etc., are.   How about dealing with the question now instead of running scared and going down another rabbit trail?	Why, why don't you tell us.
0	And for years they did. They still can. Again, there is not a real problem with pirates.	Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out sea.
1	Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, "....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically." you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence.	If grammatically meant "with proper grammar", then there would be no need to say "grammatically correct".
1	Oh spare me the condemnation ya' XXXX-hard. You aren't interested in saving souls. If you were, you would bother to have payed attention to the countless times you have been told that your abrasive, insulting tactics DON'T WORK.   Plus an eternity in hell or an eternity with a terroristic God? I think I will stick with being able to live with myself for even today, let alone an eternity.	And an eternity in hell for unrepentant, Christ-denying sinners is a good thing in your mind?
0	islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage.	as you may or may not know, satan is a fallen angel and islam is his religion which is proven by the hate, murder and death that it was built upon and has lived by since its founding.
1	Oh it applies, but if we were to look at the Bible that way, God wouldn't allow one single bad thing to happen.	If that were true God would make sure there were no such thing as a miscarriage.
0	You lost this debate Skeptic, why drag it back up again? There are plenty of other subjects that we could debate instead. Pick one of them and let's debate again. Alternatively, how about a formal debate on ID in which you never once mention Behe? That'll be a completely different one and worth considering.	...I feel that though the overwhelming number of objections brought up by Clive14 and the later objections by DE, I did not represent the Intelligent Design position as well as I could have, had I spent more time and thought on the debate.
0	A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology).	Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory, I have used an explanation of Darwin's theory from Gould's book, "Full House."
0	Well let's see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages, suddenly there was more support for a Federal Marriage Amendment than ever, Democrats lost more seats in Congress, the minority Democratic leader was defeated after years in office, a protestant presidential candidate carried the Catholic vote against a Catholic candidate, evangelicals in the country were energized, the pro-FMA candidate WON re-election even though his approval rating was 50%, and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it's up in the air again.The more you push you agenda through activist judges, the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment. At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election.	As it becomes legal in more areas, an amendment will be more difficult.
1	So, faith and argument from incredulity. If you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. Then maybe an actual scientist could take over.Major in molecular biology? Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.	Secondly, throughout my college education (majoring in Molecular Biology) I have observed the complexities of the single-cell, and find it impossible to believe that it occurred by accident (though that may not be the best choice of words).
0	So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?	Most people, when they are truly honest about it, don't.
1	Here come the Christians, thinking they can know everything by guessing, and commiting the genetic fallacy left and right.	okay, well i think that you are just finding reasons to go against Him.
1	Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means?   Also that's what jeans were called before the word "jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?)   So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies?   Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment.	Besides you are very much an exception to the rule.P.S.
1	Just to be pedantic, a better analogy would be: "If you are here, why do you have brothers and sisters?"	A similar question might be if you are here, why are your parents still alive?
0	It hasn't been proven that the Second Amendment is solely about tyrannical governments and not about dealing with violent criminals.	I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about.
0	Because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult. Any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature.	Guilty of the rapes I'm not disputing (don't know anything about those cases), but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed?
0	Pandion has already pointed out that this isn't a theory, it's a mode of wishful thinking. More damagingly, however, if you examine it for more than a moment it doesn't even fulfill the role you give it. You say 'many things in nature make no sense without God', but how do god's origins and nature make sense? Where did he/she/it spring from? All you do by invoking god as an 'explanation' is push the problems one step further back. The god hypothesis may look like an explanation, but it is not.	I, personally, believe in the theory that since many things in nature make no sense without God, he created the universe.
1	Whatever. First you say no one is calling you a hypocrite, than you say people do it, but it just an attack tactic. If you ever get to a mental state where you can entertain the possibility that a critisism of you can be grounded in reality, than go back to my post where I say "This is why..." and give it a read again. Maybe you'll learn somethig. Till then...	Yeah, I have noticed ad hominem tends to be a trend among a few folks here.
0	The article is saying that it was genetic changes. Changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes.	But he said it was followed by quick changes in specific groups of genes known as transcription factors, which control the expression of other genes, since humans diverged from their ape ancestors during the last 5 million years.
0	and i say you and everyone who denies christ is steeped in folly. reckon you'll see the errors of your reckless judgment in due time.	i am just saying you look like an idiot when you claim to know more about the jewish faith than jews.
0	Could you perhaps define "teleology" as you understand it and say why you believe there is teleology in the universe?	There is a teleology in the universe, but it's far more subtle and pervasive than you seem to think it is.
1	Interestingly everyone but 'the left' can assimilate what is being said, however, the left is notorious for their ever-present attitude that everyone else is mindless. You don't got no brownie points.....	Sam Walton was a christian, and many christians worked in his first stores and continue to do so, so using your logic Wal-Mart is a christian company "founded on Judeo-Christian precepts" (which you still have failed to list or support in any way).
1	Which you would do by having teachers teach kids that being gay is alright. You would teach those kids, against their parents wishes, that being gay is alright. You would do that after you make it legal WITHOUT A POPULAR VOTE. Seems that you really don't give a rat's XXX about this poor dead kid at all. You just see his corpse and throw him on top of your gay marriage banner. How noble of you.	The solution is for people like you to look past their own "morality" and past their own noses!
1	wow, thanks for admitting how you really feel about sex apparently. never given your so-called 'wife' an orgasm eh? i sure could...lol...	people should only have sex in order to reproduce.
1	i'm surprised that some of the more frothing liberals here have not yet suggested that we now have a way of tracking and potentially treating the 'abnormal' brains of conservatives.	sort of like saying you are born conservative, it's not a life style choice?
0	Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at.	On your link, the star shown is red in color.
0	A little of both. Japan is known for allowing its police officers to physically and mentally torture suspects and deny them legal counsel if they determine that such counsel will interfere with their interrogation. Suspects aren't allowed to read confessions before signing them either.Is that what Penfold really wants?	Are you refering to Japan or some hypothetical police state?
1	oh really? anybody can say that they are a always a guest on here and then all of a sudden come . nice try for an excuse.	nah i always watch the site while im off line as a guest, and i join when there's controversy i am not like my besty prod who stays on 24/7 i just get on every now and then and i got on today to see this scandal.
0	Jake good try at manipulating scriptures. Jesus is all about family values. The point of thsoe scriptures is that His gospel is above everything else. The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.	According to Jesus in the New Testament, here is hate and family values..."If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
1	Including the mentally ill, those with previous violent felonies, and children?	Anyone not currently in prison.

0	There is some truth here. Did you ever see "Independence Day"? They were taking pot-shots at the alien ships when they first arrived. It didn't stop the aliens... sure only a film... let's look at real life...modern - Iraq - Sadaam gave guns out to the people just before Gulf War IInot so modern - Boer War - Dutch farmers in South Africa were all excellent marksmen - Britain still invaded.US Civil War - I believe that the Confederate States were pretty well armed as far as the white citizens were concerned. US still invaded.	I'm sure invading armies would be deterred by people sniping them off at random (which is what would happen if any ever tried an invasion of America, especially in the rural areas)
0	correct, of all the freedoms most dear is the right to be left to **** alone.	the constitution gives every free american the right to bear arms.. i fully support that and all other rights .
0	never heard of it. tell me, what is the most troubling thing you have read in this bill so far? one thing i did not like was that it required me to buy insurance or pay a fine.	emoticonxwowtrying to weed through this mess reminds me of the govenor on the movie 'best little whore house in texas' if you remember the song just a little side step!
1	What, you mean like this story (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003? Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example.	Ocean acidity is old news...
0	Actually the majority of homosexuals will tell you it's not a choice. And I, being the wacky gal I am, have a tendency to believe the word of homosexuals on that particular subject over the word of straight neonazicons.	All of a sudden in the last 10 years they are trying to convice us that homosexuality is not "wrong" its a "choice"
1	But you said that you saw standing aside whilst someone murdered another was cowardly? ::sigh::Let me simplify for you. Do you kill someone to prevent a murder?	b) there are, in these cases I believe, other means of 'protest' c) if you do protest you should also be willing to support women who choose not to have an abortion... responsibility on this issue goes much deeper.
1	Make up your mind. Is it because of diet or is it because of evolution. It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it.	It's a result of Dr. Pepper, Cheetos, microwave popcorn, macaroni and cheese, hot dogs, pretzels, gum drops, high fructose corn syrup, flavors, colorings, transfats etc etc etc.......
1	Maybe I wanted it from a source that was worth looking at	You asked where it was written, I gave it to you.Unless, you really didn't want me to answer.
1	Funny how people who are "for" capital punishment don't see it that way...	Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.
0	And from this we are to infer that Leakey doubts human evolution? There is by now a huge variety of fossil hominids. If Leakey was admitting that it was difficult to be certain which were or were not directly ancestral to modern humans, this is no more than scientific honesty.	Richard Leakey: "If I were going to draw a family tree for man, I would just draw a huge question mark."
0	Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born. And as I've said, there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption.	As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it.
0	Like blacks once were? Wasn't that the main thrust of the 14th amendment and incorporation? Given incorporation, imagine the suits those acts of discrimination would bring emoticonXGood	I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.
1	Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.	BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died.
0	Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have.	since we already had one example of a creationist lowlife tactic in the george gaylord simpson quote, i decided to skim the site and see if i could find another.
1	It wasn't meant as an insult...just a statement of fact. I likely have as many or more inadequacies than do you.	corrected above, thank you, minus the insult that followed.It still stands however as a rational rebuttal.
1	Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?	For a long time they deceived me too….but after conversing with them day in and day out, I began to learn how their minds work and how to quickly spot their deceptions.
0	my question is: who's funding this?  no sane investor would give him the money needed to run such a operation especially in israel.	17and these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.
1	Seriously, in part is Waxy saying, I was here first? (It's my forum, I'll whine if I want to.)	What are you suggesting?
1	of course you can pass that sort of opinion off and some people actuall believe it. how on earth it can be tested? i guess we're only going to respect the sweeping generalisation a typical atheist trick!	if chrsitians were as vigilant about learning abut the rest of the world as they are learning about the scriptures.
1	oh dear, and your argument against me is not based on what i've said, but what kind of person you perceive me to be. ouch!	so your argument to convince people really does not matter does it?
1	Oh yes yes... never mind the thousands of lives destroyed, the shame, the guilt, the anger, the fear and all the while perhaps being in a combat zone and having that stress...  Never mind the hundreds of millions wasted retraining new people because we kicked out perfectly able people because of their sexuality...   All you can do is sit here and spew non threatening bunk to try and scare people and make your bigotry somewhat tangible to your warped mind...	your whacked out, godless drivel will be exposed for the foolishness it is come judgment day.
0	what? you didn't know that religious people are the only ones that are supposed to be silent and never try to take part in democracy, while everyone else gets to do so? where have you been? emoticonxdonno  i wonder sometimes if opponents of religion really even stop to think about what they're really saying.	the problem here is inconsistency in that you seem to think it ok for you to merge your ideology and social policy, but it is not ok for other people to do so.
1	Look at Dunblane. Then look at Columbine. Who had the higher death toll?  How often do school shootings take place in Germany?  When was the last time somebody went driving and shooting in a killing spree in America?  Name the last mass public killing in America, in a public place where the number of victims reached double digit territory.  Go on Brady, we're waiting for you to prove that you actually have a point. Don't disappoint us.	you just cant stop making things up can you?
0	Really? What a surprise! So tell me. If you don't know what it is or how it works, how do you know that you are opposed to it?	I have not studied evolution according to your way of thinking.
1	the same way most people on planet earth dont give a XXXX about american "football"	Americans as a whole don't say soccer sucks; we just don't give a rat's XXX about it.
1	that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!	now the average anti-evolutionist would like it to be just specific functions in which case you could just say novelty (information on how to create new systems).
0	Again, would you please show how this limits anyone's speech in any way? This is just paper work that lobbyists need to fill out, it's not infringing on any rights in any way. You are totally free to buy people to push your agenda, you just need to document that that is what you're doing.	If we are to limit free speech by ANYONE,
0	I see the difference, but that's not what Obama is trying to do. He got us to buy the pig at a firesale and is hoping to make money selling it back to the original farmer or give it to the fieldhands.	If I get the government to steal your pig, give it to me, and then I throw pig droppings at you all year and then keep all the pork, that is fascist economic theory.
1	A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man. And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all.	Now I ask you, what the HELL does it matter what the HELL I called it, as long as you know what it is (or can at least you can look it up, too).

0	you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing	These christians make up their mind that something is in the bible and whatever it says is what it says.
1	wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake.	i don't pretend to know what is behind your movement, but you obviously hate society.
1	whooooosh. emoticonXBye  That was the sound of my point as it went over your head.  How much do you want to but I don't find any?  Go ahead bet me! Are you afraid?	why do you think all of the states used to outlaw sodomy, and where do you think they got that from?
0	So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict? That doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then I don't have much choice in the matter, do I? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If God is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. Deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.Unless of course, God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. But then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me.	The bible also says God knows everything yet to come, so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby.
1	Buy stock in the failing banks? What a great investment. Tell me, where does the money come from?	We need to do the same...without assuming control of the banks.But why should I worry?

0	I'm not familiar with the book, so can't comment upon it first hand. However http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too. As I say I haven't read the original so cannot judge the quality of the link I'm supplying, so apologies in advance if it grossly misrepresents Mr Well's case.	Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrongby Jonathan WellsI appologise for not remembering the exact title, but its definately a good read.
0	You know, I heard that from my mom last week. My parents moved to Arkansas when my dad retired a few years back. Mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have. Ironic indeed.	But they had three of the highest divorce rates in 2003, based on figures from the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics.http://www.sunherald.com/mld/thesunh...d/10179154.htm
0	Well it all depends on who is going to determine "right", isn't it? Abortion is not math. There are no finite answers. Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history. I do like Aristotle's take; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable.	Just because people have all sorts of views on the subject does not mean that there isn't a right answer.
1	wow! i didn't know that. thanks! should i read the new york times instead?	i would not be concerned considering the source - newsmax is a notoriously right-wing site that is hardly considered a reliable source.they are about as reliable as the john mccain campaign or fox news(hee hee).
1	Yeah, gassing and murdering 6,000,000 Jews doesn't qualify as suffering very much.   emoticonXRolleyes   I wonder how many slaves were killed by comparison........	however Jews ahve not suffered very much in terms of minorities like other minorities.
0	along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen.	(no slur on librarians, i know some who are fine people, including a wealthy one, just a comparison for the thread) as to mrs. kerry's tax filing extension, that's available to any and all taxpayers.
1	Symbiote seems to have had a large hair across his butt.	If not, then you have to come to the conclusion that God does not exsist... God's only exsistance in the minds of believers just as was the case with believers of different Gods throughout human history.
1	You'd have to drown a few puppies too. Kittens might do, but you might fall a little short.	You mean I could commit fraud, become a child molester, kill a few people, rob a few banks and still be treated as normal as long as I support the ban?emoticonXRolleyesI think you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan.
0	I'm afraid it is you who is wrong. I created you so that you would think you created me to think I created everything, even though I did. It's more of a challenge that way to try to convert people to the one true religion. Since you can see that I won't be able to convert the world (it's due in a week), you can pay $100 dollars to me so I will take you with me to the upper world.	I'm afraid you're wrong, as I created you in my universe, and implanted in you a belief that you were a god.
0	fair enough. i tend to run skeptic. i am surprised that i am a theist. if you were to believe in a god, which would it be?	thus i am not convinced

1	No, you at least need a sling shot and ball bearings, lol.	One guy held up three separate banks with a simple knife.
0	And that is different how? I told johnny to write that I'm infallible. Therefore the book that I told johnny to write proves I'm infallible. There is no difference.   You do realize that there are other religions out there? That science is constantly updating?   Your arguments have been nothing more then false dichotomies assuming there are only two choices despite history laughing in your face.	i thought there were only evo or creo to choose from.
1	Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?  Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world.	nice observation, chum, but the real god - the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob - is alive and well and wants to see you when you die.
0	Yes yes, this was all covered in Wells' previous book, Icons of Evolution. It has been refuted numerous times (some even on this forum). See here for a thorough debunking.	Wells also shows how most of the other "evidence" for evolution -- including textbook "icons" such as Peppered Moths, Darwin's Finches, Haeckel's Embryos, and the Tree of Life -- has been exaggerated, distorted .
1	Methinks it's rather obvious that mintaka is JimIrvine because no rational newbie would come here and agree with Irvine's ridiculous and juvenile attacks/assertions out of the box. emoticonXRolleyes	With his cutie not far behind.
1	If we could rub a brass lamp, make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately, I'd agree with you. But since we live in the REAL WORLD, we must become OIL INDEPENDENT while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources.	Promoting renewables is a good thing, but increasing the supply of oil in counter productive in helping renewables to reach the critical mass needed to survive economically.
0	Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made "morals and ethics" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men.	I think that Darwin and Dawkins have made the issue of "morals and ethics" a joke.
0	Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848.	This was because the *dark* forms resting on light tree-trunks were more easily spotted, and thus eaten, by birds.
1	So this singularity that appeared out of no were became a greater singularity which took on perfect balance and form?	Actually, nothing did not explode, a singularity expanded :)
1	two reasons: first, i come from a jewish family, and i've never heard of this before. now, i'll grant that nothing says that i should have, but this is news to me. second, and more importantly, trebor is not the person who made the positive claim; you are. it is your burden of proof. no one here can blame me for questioning your bare assertions given your history with falsehoods. so if he doesn't respond in a mere three hours, you declare victory? how about you call me presumptuous again? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you aren't able to back up your claim. congratulations. try it next time without accusing somebody of being cowardly and misleading.	but i suspect that trebor has asked those with better recollections of the time than he has and they have confirmed for him that what i said is true, which is why he hasn't come back and refuted my response to him.
0	The memo is real, nobody has ever been able to disprove it. Handgun Control Inc. (the people who later became the Brady Campaign) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position. However them simply stating this, is no different than Obama making a statement on national news, and then several months later saying "I never said that" and trying to reverse his position.Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda, the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after.	As the "leak" appears to have happened SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, she may have difficulty catching up with that.
0	Apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the Illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the Constitutions. It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it. The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down. Knowing the State of Illinois, I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners.   The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time.	To think that a common sense measure like this could come out of a senseless place like Illinois.
1	It's Satan, not Satin. And he's your daddy, not ours (John 8:44).	I'm sorry but to me spreading misinformation sounds like something the Devil would do.god is really the Devil.All you Christians are actually the properly of Satin.Way to go Satin!
0	an image is not the original. a photo of you is not you, its an image of you. the image cannot be or replace the original, and isnt intended toregardless of how "perfect" the photocopier is, you cannot cash the "perfect" copy of the check. it may be a perfect replica, to the detail, but it is still only an image. the problem isnt the quality of the copying process, but the fact that the copy itself is just that, a copy, not the original	Or are you saying that God has a big imperfect copy machine that he jumps into and out pops an imperfect copy.My thought was that God was the direct agent of creation (without the use of intervening mechanical devices), and being a perfect Being incapable creating imperfection (for then He would not be God), all of His creation would be as perfect as He is.So does this perfect God have a spine that is a plethora of engineering disasters?
0	are you trying to say that people of faith cannot tell the difference between myth and reality? i'm actually confused by this sentence.	*edited  cthulhu, unfortunately we couldn't even prove one of them wrong because they are faith based.
1	Yes, some people are jumping ship, which is a crying shame. STICK TO YOUR GUNS MEN! WE'RE WINNING!	It seems that the creationists are beginning to change there views.evolution can be explained by science but creation relys on myth, superstition and hope, but few people are now suggesting that the two theories can be explained together, god started everything then evolution took over.Its like the creationist is trying to put one over the evolutionist by suggesting that god created evolution.But in reality i think a person who believes in creation is coming to terms that the creation theory is a bit far fetched and the evolution theory makes more sense, but due to religious conditioning still continue to grasp on the creation theory.Which really means the bible would be disregarded as a source of information.

0	No one wants to take your "marriage" away Matt. It's a free country--no one's going to block your way to any chapel that will marry you. Do your gay thing. But let marriage be marriage--it's a different matter. People just want to keep you from tampering with the institution of marriage.	There is nothing the conservatives, republicans, or chistonazis can do to stop or take this license from us.
0	Exactly. It is their fault, but they can do what they choose. It is punishment and you know it, and it is not your job to make sure no "irresponsible" pregnant woman goes unpunished.	The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it.
0	And yet, for most pro-choice folk on these forums, this question really is meaningless. For, even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights, they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable. Even you believe this Shooter.	Most pro-choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts, or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights.
1	Good observation! He is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content. He is one of the more fellatious people I know and you won't find him taking notice of the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land either.	So the basis for your articles thesis is fallacious in expecting armed people to somehow become extensions of law enforcement in order to justify being armed.Therefore, the only rational response to your premise is to encourage more law abiding people to be armed and trained so as to outnumber the armed criminals so they will have no unarmed citizens to victimize.

0	Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.	all of the british papers keep going on about how bad it is, how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets, how guns are being imported into britain and resold through underground channels, how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage, etc.
1	Because there couldn't possibly be any undetected illegal gun trafficking, could there be?	Requiring a background check for handgun sales byprivate sellers and licensed gun dealers helps reduceillegal gun trafficking within a state.Pick the percentage.

0	I think an open mind is the best thing to have when it comes to theories. I think there is some truth in everything.	As trebor has said, "creation science" is an attempt to find scientific sounding reasons that can be used to justify the conclusions that have already been reached and that are not subject to change.

0	Well, as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint. Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this: "My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject".Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it.	This guy has been debating me for almost a year now...I thought I would share one of his post with you.

It is not his body, therefore, he has no right to make the ultimate decision. He can only express his view. That's about it. (I'm pretty sure it's not any easier for her to decide). So cudos to those men.	A "real man" helps those who he loves, whether he likes what they did.

After only 33 posts Mintaka already has the political and gun advocacy priorities of individual members here down pat; or should I say the resurrected antonia, our resident National socialist healthcare freak does and couldn't help but expose her personal insights where none should exist for this alleged newbie.	How ironic you would even care since (1) you've opposed saving the lives of 101,000 of your fellow Americans who died this past year because of inadequate care, and (2) you think people should defend themselves with their own guns and stop burdening taxpayers with police departments.Oh and do take notice of the costly tasteless suit who came downstairs from the corporate palaces to arrogantly stand next to the underpaid cop in N.Y.C., and as if he owned the city's police forces.Anyone know that Costly Tasteless Suit's name?
0	SNIPThis opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an "assault weapons ban" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier.	But as it turns out, there appears to be little basis for the number....
0	Old news. There have been accusations of similar stories for years.	With that established, I would be interested in your comments.
0	YOU LIAR.You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said "FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS" in North Carolina 1 year later.And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?	From the end of my narration setting up Heston's speech in Denver, with my words, "a big pro-gun rally," every word out of Charlton Heston's mouth was uttered right there in Denver, just 10 days after the Columbine tragedy.
0	dear chloe, do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion? that is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote, embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of human beings. if one kills a human being, one is guilty of murder.	silly chloe...how can a part of the womens body other than her own mouth cry?

1	Yes...I think I would agree with you. That's what happens when you have superstition coupled with self-imposed ignorance I suppose. It's a shame!	The poorest part of America is the bible belt.Along with that, infant mortality rates approaching some third world countries plus all the stuff we have already talked about makes me believe that something is wrong there and it has to do with the bible.
1	Did you slip in it AGAIN? Were you led astray by a passage from Heller you thought you could use to legitimize gun control, your wet dream?I submit from many past rulings of the courts that little statement is in error.	The case is not novel, and my sense is that the defense is generally recognized: Just as what would otherwise be the crime of murder, attempted murder, battery, and the like might be justified if done in defense against an imminent threat, so a felon’s taking possession of a gun is justified if done in defense against an imminent threat.
1	the aussies are banning publications and films of women with small breasts. if you think that mens mags like nuts are pornographic you are a little sad..dont mix with other men much..mother told you sex was dirty? oh dear the porn expert is insinuating that i must be getting my rocks off..see above:) graphic depictions of rape are freely available in videos and so are not 'rare'. expert on slasher films with 'teenage trollops getting killed...see above:)	my point is that graphic depictions of rape are rare in film.
1	Isn't that exactly what I said! Clearly we have an issue of a probably overweight white man who is without a doubt racist (because if we know anything it is that every white male that has short hair is a racist) coming down on a black woman!

Oooh yes, and I'm sure a policeman would just as easily have treated a 7 month pregnant white woman in the Connecticut burbs the same way.

0	And depending on what human is "finding the answers" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings.

1	Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does.

One of the wealthiest segments of our population are gays.
1	that's probably being saved for the next round of national election fodder. maybe something on the order of occupying all the me, making it a christian democracy while we use their oil for their own good? with every family owning their own home, two cars and a boat. wait, they've used that promise and it failed. not to worry, i'm sure they'll come up with something that'll keep the sheep headed towards the cliff.	with myself being one of the american sheep here, ( an alert one tho, ) i was hoping to see someone post a big secret, saying that our govt has a secret fuel source all ready to go , but were just holding out on it, until the oil was almost gone, and everyone had gotten all of their riches from the fossil fuel.

0	Actually, this (if what that article is true, which I am not quite sure) is a healthy part of science. Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare. Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed. Man's theories change everyday, while God's word has remained the same.	For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down.

1	Yup. Give me an example of a true inaccuracy, instead of working to poke fun. Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures. Are you scared because you see the "ancients" commenting on subjects you thought science had "discovered" since the "enlightenment"? Man, how arrogant can you get? You remind me of the Pharasees. Arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend. Either explain how the Bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above, or don't bother posting.	I guess you spend a lot of money on those 1-900 psychics too.
0	There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.	The coelacanth, according to fossil records, and according to evolutionists, allegedly went extinct millions and millions of years ago.Until they were found alive.Coelacanth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaAs if this should be any surprise.

0	he was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. i don't condone it, but i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. it wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.	i hope this sicko does not get the death penalty.

1	Nice to know that you are breaking the law responsibly. emoticonXGood	I get in the left lane and pass everybody, but do it safely.
0	Because some restrictions that might pass constitutional muster, don't amount to an outright ban. How would impossibility ever be considered constitutional?	The Breyer-Sotomayor-Ginsburg dissent questioned why some restrictions would be acceptable but not the Chicago handgun ban:
0	First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition.	If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot.
0	Agreed that they are still the same species, much like the "13 species" of Darwin's Finches, and I have no problem with evolution in that respect. I can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time. But I still don't see where evolution, in that sense of the term, can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest, or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland.	If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other.
0	freedom dearie are you serious about pepper spray? just yesterday i presented a story where a taser and bean bag rounds from a shotgun did literally nothing against a 68 year old with a bad heart condition. what can a cheap chemical agent do against an adrenaline charged youth who's got more vitality and health on his side than a senior citizen in new york?	i am not against gun rights, or for the mad-regulators of the left; but if i were zimmerman right now (assuming he is telling the truth) i would be kicking myself now until the day i die for not carrying pepper spray and trying that first.

1	Thank you for this thoughtful exposition on the historicity of your loving mentor.	Anyone and everyone who is fed up with Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer, the liar Chris Dodd, the incompetent Harry Reid, carnal left-wing hedonism, people who erringly bow down to obese Buddha-like statues that can't hear and can't talk or reason; pseudo-Christians like Barack Obama and his followers who forgot to read Psalm 139:13 and Jeremiah 1:5, so they push infanticide/abortion; trillion-dollar budget-busting socialists who put America in incredible debt because they want their feel-good Utopia to come to pass; left-wing politicians who will run their mouths about Iran building a nuclear weapon but are too dumb and gutless to do anything about it; and anyone who looks or thinks like Barney Franks.
0	No no; again, you don't get it. He's only struggling because of people like you who deny the obvious. Rather than listen to what Majerus says about Majerus's project, you're listening to Mr. Mistaken Coyne and the author of the the Science article, which doesn't say what you think it says.	... and is still struggling ... to draw any kind of scientific conclusion, even one drawn upon contrived and artificial conditions.
1	since you are so oblivious to the truth, and probably flunked science a couple of times: http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/essays/courtenay1.htm http://newton.nap.edu/html/creationism/evidence.html http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/the%20...g%20theory.htm http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm fact listen: [ fkt ] n.  knowledge or information based on real occurrences: an account based on fact; a blur of fact and fancy.  a. something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed: genetic engineering is now a fact. that chaucer was a real person is an undisputed fact. see above. http://www.carm.org/abortion/embryo.htm a piece of my hair is of the homo sapein species too. does that mean my hair is a person? perhaps you need to get your 'facts' straight.	a fact can just mean 'a truth that exists' or it can be a 'something known to exist'....so, whatever.
1	Two answers: they were either of the ant kind and didn't eat wood until they underwent hyperevolution after the landing of the ark, or they were placed in a suspended state of hibernation by 'Awlmighty Gawd' (only two - one male and one female, in spite of the fact that termites don't actually propagate that way). It is, after all, the word of Gawd, as revealed in the wholly babble.	And what did Noah do about the termites?
0	A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one.	Then banning same-sex marrige would be wrong, and there would be no reason for it.
1	He wasn't trying to. Shooterandproud may be an unreasonable gun nut, but he accepts evolution.	Despite your bull in a china shop rampage through the fields of bioogy, cosmology and paleo, you have not yet given any evidence of a 6000 year old earth, god made in 6 days.
0	Well, it depends on your definition of retarded I guess. The standards to get a drivers license are really not that high. Think of how dumb the average person is, and realize that 50% of people are dumber than that. Kinda makes you cringe.   And you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident? Well, perhaps the fact that I am a concientious, defensive, and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road. Maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me, I should just throw my hands in the air and scream "take the wheel jesus!" I am sure some magical being will fly down from heaven and save me from crashing. Yeah...sure.	They depend on level-headed, indiscriminate folks like you and I to do that...and most everything else for that matter.
0	Oh, there's no hypocrisy involved, just you being your usual self and not even looking at the actual information (or, more likely, looking at the information and then deliberately playing dumb).	I just wanted to point out the obvious hypocrisy of everything your side represents, and nothing more.

0	Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't "on the grounds," although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property. It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district. The children go to the seminary on released-time, which has been found to be constitutional (although I don't see how).Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are:McCollum v. Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306)McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that "accommodating" religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not.	I live in Utah and every public school has a building on the grounds called the seminary.

0	And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. That's not what a Democracy is about, at least not our Democracy.	If minorities' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives, then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system.
0	seriously man, i hope you don't believe what they tell you on that channel. it's just whoa. this one anchor woman was talking about how background checks led to registration than extermination; i was shocked. the thing with fox is, they put on whatever rupert murdoch wants.	well, i think he knows what both of them are and all news stations are bias.
0	The fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method. There is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being, and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact, yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god. Mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others I have spoke with on this subject. I do believe in scientific method, but I also have faith that god is out there.	Scientific facts keep changing, because they keep building on what is proven.

0	How long has the boyfriend been 16? Is he closer to 15 or 17?How long has nocturnal09 been 14? Is she closer to 13 or 15?If nocturnal09 will be 15 in a couple of days or so and the boyfriend just turned 16 about a month ago, then the 14 vs 16 thing isn't really the biggest deal. Depending on when their b-days fall, they could both be in the same graduating class. He could have been born in May 1990 while she was born in July 1991. Therefor, he is 16 but she will still be 14 for at least another half of a month. Now, none of this information was given. All I'm saying is that the 2 year gap (until more info is given there) can not be considered the biggest problem.	Similarly, if you're boyfriend is happy to have sex with someone 2 years younger than he is (which is a pretty significant age gap at that age)...
1	you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise.	If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens.

0	Actually, it has.      The last time I checked, well still have gay marriages in Massachusetts. As a matter of fact, it seems that it is difficult for most politicians to be elcted in the state without being supportive of marriage equality.	said it was alright did make it alright for the rest of the country.2 liberal states didn't push the rest of the country to follow like sheep to a slaughter.
1	Wow Archie, way to suck the fun out of something. Let me use your words here:	Any powers you attribute to the fictional character Superman, you can accurately attribute to Jesus and you wont find him wanting.
1	you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.	then you keep them on your government plantation so they can vote to keep you in power.

1	So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.	I believed and hoped in the possibility.It was Jesus, the living son of God.. he had feet, hands, legs - he had a body yes.I never looked at his face, but i knew who it was - for one thing nobody walks around in robes anywhere near where I live.
0	Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of "arms" include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case.	They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals, but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms.
0	And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality.	If economic systems are not governed and regulated, people can be victimized by the systems.

0	what does that have to do with the issue being discussed? unless you're suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing. is that the point you're trying to make? beside, by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians, you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is. so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all?	hey archie, have you watched for the bible tells me so yet?
0	Sucide? Isn't that a mental health issue? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person, does that cure depression?   If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide.   If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide.	those who have firearms in their homes are more likely to die of murder and are more likely to die from suicide.
0	i'm sorry, but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded. i can see (remotely) how abortion might be considered anti-woman (although it is of course anti-life before being anything else), but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women's suffrage, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, etc.? by the way, do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion? i am catholic, and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned (except abortion, because it has nothing to do with women's rights) are viewed positively by the catholic church, or ever have been. please explain with details.	we were making some social progress, but that seems to be slowing in several states as our government imposed siege mentality rolls out the same old insecurities.
0	oh yes we can. invoking god is not an explanation for ultimate origins, it's the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declaring further application of the question off limits. simply declaring that god's origin doesn't need explaining does not make that so.	you see, this could go on for a while, because the next logical question is 'where did that stuff come from' and so on.
0	And here our Government recognizes:  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people	That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law.

1	And I'm sure you of all people know the mind of God... Please, you just take snippets of scripture, and twist it into well this is absolute.

0	What issues? You drivel on about breasts forming on lizards (even though the most primitive milk secretors we have today don't have anatomically distinct mammary glands, and the earliest mammals evolved from reptiles not remotely like lizards), then triumphantly crown your straw man with what you seem to think is a knock-down point about nerve connections.Yes, SS, the most primitive milk-secreting structures we know are modified sweat glands; your incredulity does not alter that fact one iota. And guess what? Sweat glands have nerve connections to the hypothalamus...	ssues I raised in my OP regarding the initial formation of breasts.
0	The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the "quality of life" test.	A position of pro-choice is pro-life because the lives and quality of life of women are valued.
1	perhaps you would like to explain simplistic.  Is the anthropic principle simplistic?  What natural law created natural law?  Where did the information come from?

0	Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said "You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term." I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted.	Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for "choice" remains consistent.Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children?

So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.   Thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. Kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and MOST creationists use the KINDS thing as a support for their arguments.	the big bang chemical evolution: the origin of higher elements from hydrogen stellar and planetary evolution: origin of stars and planets organic evolution: the origin of life macro-evolution: changing from one kind of animal into another there is a sixth evolutionary theory, but it has been proved in a controlled environment, and it is called micro-evolution (variations within kinds)

1	You're living in an absolute naive dream world about this guy. I think I should be trying to sell YOU the beachfront property.	In addition, he did what no other leader int eh ME was willing, he shared the income fromthe oil fields.
1	Good to know that sence of humor hasn't completely evaded you.   Had me worried there for a moment, or two, or three... emoticonXWow	WHO'S OUT TO GET ME??
0	yeah! its a benefit to be able to do a thing like that. i'm amazed that we've come so far in technology and science, but i think there is a line of what we can offer people. its not like they're gonna chose whether they want to have an egg or a bagel for breakfast.	i agree, it is we that it is ridicules that we have gotten so into controlling stuff that now we even have a way to control natural courses, but i guess like i said before if it is to stop your child from suffering a sickness then i guess that is okay (still bad) but better than just being a complete control freak, or being selfish
0	Of course the bolshevik revolution was doomed from the start as Russia was not indsutrialised and the revolution was imposed by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat (not that there was a proletariat in Russia at the time).	1989, the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down, along with Soviet Ideology.Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it.
0	Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes.	regardless, we have yet to see any evolution of new body parts or its so called "steps" if evolutionists want to suggest that a few decades is too little time
0	The 'teachings' either have no substance, or are certainly not original. Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God, and why this figure commands worship and obeisance.	Instead of using your mind and energies to disprove the bible you should use all your power to to learn how to obey the teachings of the Son of God and mature emotionally and in wisdom.
0	Well, I personally agree that I 'spanked' marc9000 (http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6348). But we'll have to leave it to the judges to make the formal decision.	I'd congratulate you on your win DamEtel, but I'm more impressed with your patience.
0	Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.	Pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not have been accomplished in any other way, is not "raising science on a pedestal"- it's merely reciting the obvious.
1	I don't recall seeing anyone who's for gay marriage come out truly in favor of the idea here that I recall. Can you? Naw, didn't think so. emoticonXSmilie	I think that's exactly why the anti-gay marriage crowd would never go for that idea.
1	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.	I'm sorry if you want to talk past that, and say I disgust you.
0	You blame others for your failure to understand the basics.	Over the years these “educated” people through the media as journalist and movie/television writers began sharing their preliminary understanding of evolution as indisputable fact.
0	This is poor example. Focusing on saving lives over burying the dead doesn't do anything to trump personal autonomy.	If you say there is no such thing as a hierarchy of rights, or if you say the right to personal autonomy trumps the right to life, I point you to observe the situation in New Orleans.
1	oh yeah? tell that to the next person you see running down the street wielding a knife. ;)	it is within a mans power to control his emotions this in essence is rationality.

0	Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce.	I'm against gay marriage and have been happily married for 31 years, thereby disproving your BS.
1	i love it when you bash people for stating opinions and no facts when you turn around and the same thing...i take it you have proof of a lie (keep in mind that lying is not the same as being wrong). as for hagel...i will assume he is actually in iraq right now and wrote that. give me a break emoticonxrolleyes	but then the bush people never saw a lie that they couldn't embrace.
1	The first Christians were Jews. Anyone who claims to be a Christian but hates Jews is a XXXXX. An anti-Semetic Christian is like an oxymoron term. And an Aryan is supposed to be someone with blue-eyes, brown-hair, and light-skin. You don't have to believe in 'Aryanism' to be Aryan, and the mortal enemies of Aryans are not Jews. 'Aryans' may hate Jews, but most Jews aren't bigoted. By the way, Hitler did not like just Jews but others he considered 'inferior' to the 'superior' 'Aryan race.'   Do some actual research instead of pulling XXXX out of the air to conform to your screwed up opinions.	aryan was more than, as you put it, "just white"... and as a religion, the mortal enemy of the aryans are jews... you had to be a christian and hitler hated catholics... guess PROTESTANT is the only one left.
0	i'm pro-choice because when i get pregnant, i want to chose whether or not i will abort it. i am not pro-abortion because i don't want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro-life, because i don't want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-abortion, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all have abortions'' you on the other hand go on and say ''hey let's give all fetuses life'' that's what makes you pro-life. i don't want abortion. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal. don't change the title, i just want people to know that we are called pro-choicers.	if it means this much to you i will change the debate title.
1	So your answer to the question then is "Nothing", Marc?	Well let's see, from your "EvC Forum" link;You gather information from other forums, then use it as bait on yet another forum?
1	if homosexuals don't think, how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators? the fact is, the more homosexuality there is, the less abortions. if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man-wife would never abort once. are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas?	by the way you forgot to mention: think, behave morally, and have concern for the future.
0	I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!	I don't think the lightning strike will be proven it is merely plausibe.
0	True, but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it. I know many christians who believe in god, and jesus etc, but think the bible is completely false, and is only a book of fables. Thats what i was trying to imply.	Do the Christians that you know that believe in evolution, believe that there was no first man named Adam, or that there was no Genesis flood?
0	dear noob, i chose the anthem as a song which describes me. however since i am reforming this site into a more democratic community i shall make a debate seeking for a new one.	why do we have such a rubbish anthem for this site?
1	i am very impressed with your ability to copy and paste links. now what this proves about what you know about it is still unproven. unless you are the one in the videos giving the lectures...and he looks like he has been studying this longer then 'almost a decade'. nice try though. what proof can you give that is pertinent to the debate about how that disproves an eternal being? also you may want to get with some of the other atheists on the site because they were pushing the eternal universe and big bounce theories as explanations in other debates. you all should get your scientific consensus on the same page.	that just proves you can use the search function in youtube.
1	Are you sure? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida. His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida. If he is retired, he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs. Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time. Somehow 2 tours turned into 4, midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor.   All in all, VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying, lack of education and reading comphrension problems.	He probably still thinks that the US won the war.
0	i'm not surprised you would say this. it is the statement of a person who would want power and control over a woman's womb, which, btw, inoygdb.	i'd argue that the woman wants to control who lives or dies.
1	Yeah, right, JO, socialist countries are Eden Mecca's all over the world today. No matter how many times they fail, its proponents just need another chance.	I think all Americans should be aware of just what a blight socialism is on the rest of the world so that we don't fall into that same lazy mindset.

0	And if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black Americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well. I can't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open...it has to be expected. People have strong feelings about abortion rights (just like racism) and it is naive to think something like this wasn't going to happen.	I think it might show the true character of some people...
0	Sounds like the Brady Law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns.	A study by The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence showed that, since it's enactment, the Brady Law background check kept handguns out of the hands of over 312,000 prohibited purchasers - including 113 felons a day.http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/r...h/bradyred.asp
1	So? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman's uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds.	“However the Bible does say "I create you before I placed you in the womb"...this would imply that God created you before you are even conceived.”
0	demon, that was quick were you right there? no resentment in my heart friend. i try to translate an expression from hungarian (again i guess that will be poor but i try anyway) 'friendship remains' (or 'unchanged' may be the better word?)  now here is what you asked:  that is a very good question demon, but i would put one more word there 'who'. no insult intended.	i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of.
0	Well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue.	According to the Old Testament, Sodom and Gammorah were destroyed because the rich oppressed the poor (which is nearly an essential part of Capitalism), not because of homosexuality.
0	that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about.	this is what i support.
1	Ok if we can not use guns. Can we use baseball bats? Is that OK with you?	So, if anyone actually takes you up on your offer, and expresses and idea, then, they better watch out if it doesn't agree with yours!That makes sense.
0	And I'm going to correct you again. The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view. More than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations.	True, but as Lurch corrected me before: It is the theory of evolution.
0	Those abortions that are perpetrated as "birth control" should be outlawed.	It is for this reason that "convenience abortions" are technically illegal here in the UK, but they occur anyway.
1	lol. says the one who did not even bother to open the specific post link.  huh. again, you don't care about evidence. i gave it to you and you said i never did despite the link to the specific post right there.  liar you call me? well, i guess it takes one to know one.  questionable. all that the author did was state that the evidence rejects yec. he does not argue for another form of creationism.  please stop trying to argue there is only one form of creationism.  my god you are dishonest. still avoiding why arch would replace yec with christanity eh?  apparently you think interchangeability means that the words mean two different things despite being used interchangeably as the same.	actually if you read the link you posted, you will see that the author is not just a christian who is neutral on yec, but he tends to favor creationism.

1	A woman's right to choose to keep her legs together is not in any way abridged by this bill. Ho, ho,f***ing ho.	Another great irony is now a mostly male Democratic leadership that thinks taking away women's right to choose is a Christmas gift or bonus to the American people, of whom over 50% are women.
0	whether there's liberal parties in other countries is beside the point. there is no national 'liberal party' in the usa. if nato was suggesting the ny one, i hardly can be held responsible for not knowing 'their message'. i couldn't care less what it might be.  she said as much. let's see what happens next, shall we? i have a feeling she'll be amending the policy shortly.	i was referring to your outright statement that there was 'no liberal party' when indeed there is one almost in every country.

1	You mean to tell me that you would deny a woman's right to her own body for a zygote, yet you have no problem murdering real human beings? Sounds like a conservative to me...	so thats quite contradictory to me... you would allow a law that killls millions of innocent babies a year and get rid of a law that rightly carries out the law... wierd sounds like a liberal to me.
1	So what are you proposing? Death panels? Do you think we should euthanase the elderly or should we simply stop their social security payments and healthcare?	We don't have the funds for Medicare, Medicaide or Social Security either.But, why am I even hopeful that you will take any of that into consideration.
0	Right. And that is the reason for peer review. Creationists don't subject their ramblings to peer review. That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists. Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation.	It is clear that scientists can affect their experiments and observations, even in spite of their best efforts.
0	Because you know the peer review process is biased. Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read. The scientific community's problems are just that big.	Why do I think they are popular books, and not peer reviewed scientific articles?
1	not to me, but let's not quibble about things we can't change. let's talk about something that we can change...for a change. we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that's written. how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in 'special' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals won't bounce us off the walls.	you could go there but it won't change the fact i don't agree with your ideas of what is says.

I am working here on the assumption that you are not a smoker: how do like it when someone blows tobacco smoke in your face?
1	so the old man was doing something criminal by carrying a firearm for self defence? the bar***d! how can you do such a thing, breaking the law like that, or maybe if the criminal who beat him up was the one who actually deserved to be charged, or better shot. so you think that this man who was following the law (texas case) deserved to go to jail for defending his property and anybody else who may have been hurt, killed as a result of their next crime? are you actually insane? have you lost your marbles? what is wrong with you?	in other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law.
0	Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.	But the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than

The riegtous go the heaven, and everyone else remains leading a normal, religion free life on earth? Hmmm...4) Hebrews?5) Can it help? The gospels tell a story about a carpenter who lived 2000 years ago, and may or may not have been the son of god. Yeah, I can see how that can help. Why can't I worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster?	yah it sucks that a God would kill you for not believing in him but who said life was fair?

I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's.	And secondly, it's a bit rich for them to call it murder when a blastocyst can turn into a tumour.
0	i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!	my point is that many people who have fought for human rights claim religion as part of their inspiration, and with your all-or-nothing approach, i can only assume you'd still condemn religion even if gets more and more gay friendly.
1	i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?	why do the 'loving' christians always threaten eternal torment when you ask them for information?

0	I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.	That will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but can't prevent crime from occurring as it's happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings.You anti-second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men.

0	Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief.	'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.

0	No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.	with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species wouldn't the old species not exist any more?

0	Well, if they've re-established control in New Orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. If they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (I'm very pro-2nd Amendment, so don't get me wrong here. I'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)I also think that it's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in--just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt. for NOT sending in the military. Now people are criticizing them for doing it???	Sending in the army in full force, confiscating guns and talking about an 'insurgency' just because of a couple of crackpots have been firing their guns.On an average day in New York there are 10 times as many reports of shootings, yet I don't see such a massive military response over there...

0	So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.

0	Would you mind telling us just how he determined ALL maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements? To me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so! After all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence! Your claim would seem to be impossible, but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so.	A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.
0	does the grand canyon strike you as a 'crack' as well? like? what makes them so dangerous if it ain't their guns and their willingness to use them?  this assumes that no da is presently going after them. something i highly doubt.  diversionary tactic on your part. wouldn't making guns harder for them to acquire be helpful?	always a case that slips through the cracks... well how about we focus on the genuine problem instead of making something else into a problem.
0	And I see you still flip back and fourth from being an atheist to not being an atheist.	(Oh, and I see you're still equating "atheist" with "anyone who doesn't believe as I do")
0	Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars.	That's their prerogative, as it was obviously a private screening and that's the way it works.
1	Here is a mind blower. Maybe they are celebate because being married to Jesus they are saving themselves for sex with him.	:) God could easily call someone to try serving him through priesthood to allow them to get the experience, and choose for themselves whether it is something that uses their god-given gifts the best.

The internet site also quotes:	[Not arguing with creationists] This is not because I cannot answer their arguments, but because I have better things to do with my time and I do not want to give them the oxygen of publicity.
0	They do it on purpose, alright. But not because it'll be shot down -- in at least one state, the Supreme Court decided that similar legislation did not address more than one issue.The reason they put them together is that, in most states, a ban on civil unions would FAIL.	They push through the amendment to quiet the RR while the issue is a hot botton topic, but make sure it's unconstitutional so that it'll get shot down.Just a thought.
1	But yet you have the right to make an an a-s-s out of yourself? As far as the nude beaches go, it would be worth the plane fare if I knew you were going to be at one so I could laugh my a-s-s off.   FROTFLMAO	But we have no right to bare our a-s-s-e-s in public, unless in a nudist beach of which there are quite a few.
0	she is an attractive woman. what was she doing witha 14 yr old? she could probably walk into any local club or bar and pick up the man of her choosing.  does she have a specific thing for kids? will she do it again with another kid once this one grows up? if so she is a predetor. of coarse several hundred years ago kids of this age married and fornicated as part of everyday life. is our society that different than is was then?  i was a horn dog when i was 14. or at least wanted to be.	so do you think a male teacher would also receve a similar sentance as a female teacher?

0	Origins of science, whether truly started by those of faith or not, is irrelevant. Whatever science was, it has become a body of knowledge, through application of reason.	‘The philosophy of experimental science…began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation… It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.'

1	like i said in another thread, the argument i hear most often from so-called 'pro-choicers' is that you cannot legislate morality. well then what can you legislate? every law in existence is legislation of morality! by that way of thinking, then we should have no laws. if someone kidnaps and murders your 3-year-old child, then let's hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality!	what do you see as the major flaw of the view opposite of your in regards to how abortion should be dealt with?
1	Nice attempt at an audition. Since the law firm you hired is supposed to find a director and president for your crumbled .org do you think you will get the job?

1	Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right.	The problem with this is that usually when someone exercises "their right" it many times infringes on someones elses rights.
1	do you seriously mean to suggest that the entire campaign, election, and inauguration would have taken place under the scrutiny of the world without this vital discovery being made? if so, it looks as though you and phelps both set bells to ringing when you pass by. the bells say, 'bong, bong, bong!!	i say he is a liar...and always will be a liar.
0	Again???? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens (i.e. black) from owning guns... Liberal terms such as "saturday night special" all have racist undertones. Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority... Who are these laws meant to target?	Have I proposed a law which would restrict gun usage for only a certain race?
0	This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a "special right" is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays...... but for most people, they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit.I think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee's sexual orientation.But to utilize your phrasing Archie, do you think that religion is something that deserves "special rights"?	You think you deserve special rights?

0	even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo.	governmental funding is not available (to my knowledge) without some (if not total) government control of the program.

1	i can't believe he used that on me. just goes to show that he will mimic not only preachers but any one else that he thinks will make him look good at the time. ez why don't you stop this?? people will actually converse with and discuss things that you feel are important if you would only think for yourself. forget the dogma,.. forget the spoon feed interpetations of a dusty old book and think for yourself. people will actually begin to take you seriously.	just thought i'd mention that :-)

0	that seems to beg the question. be convinced one way or the other as much as you like, but if you can't prove your position, or even provide evidence for it, then how can you possibly use it to justify anything? yes, people's religious beliefs influence them. what shooter seems to be asking is if that's in any way reasonable? if you're basing your entire life on some point, should you be able to show that your beliefs about that point are true? put another way, it's kinda dumb to base major life decisions on a feeling, isn't it?	believing whether god exists or not is a huge factor in not only determining day to day decisions, but entire identities and lifestyles.
0	The meticulously preserved, unchanging 66 Books of the Bible aren't compelling?	And i dont really believe in god because he has shown us NO compelling evidence of his existance.
1	What does spelling have to do with your own opinion? Again this isn't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone's spelling and just didn't answer the question. This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion. It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate.	I am not entitled to my own opinion if it doesn't agree with yours.
0	Oh, buddy, Atheism has EVERYTHING to do with that. The morality-less framework of Atheism ALLOWED them to justify the horrors that they inflicted.	Third, it is most tiresome to see all the horrors of the world ascribed to atheism when atheism has nothing to do with them.
0	hmmm, the employment, housing, and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state doesn't allow you to ask about sexual orientation.  as for marriage...anyone is allowed to marry (so long as they are of age). you just have a problem with the definition of marriage. as for the military thing...seems like a complicated issue. where does a gay man shower for example? the womans bathroom? there own special bathroom? the mens bathroom? other issues involving relationships could arise as well. as for the adoption thing...only florida doesn't allow it outright.	christians can join the military and mention they are christian.
0	Let's not confuse our readers. supersport is not saying it's evolution; he's saying that "evolutionists" say that it's evolution. It should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity.	[to supersport]Your clumsy bait and switch was beginning a discussion about evolution and then trying to represent the seasonal change in color of foxes as evolution.
0	But it is based on history. There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions. Or, if their families had money. went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries.Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services.	Not only that, to suggest that untold numbers of women would seek illegal abortions is a question-begging claim that has no grounding in history, logic, or reason.
0	They originally might have been an arbitrary guess, but experience of all humans always has given them a very high probability of being true (at least the existence of the outside world, the others are abstract logical concepts that don't have a physical reality, just an abstract one).	One of these aspects of existence which we arbitarily believe in is cause and effect.
0	Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.	Still, some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language.

1	Except that the government was tapping phones, and isn't interfering with freedom of speech. But if you ignore reality, then your parallel kinda works, I guess.	The fear factor you hope is there is no different from that pushed by the left when 'big brother' let it be known that phones were being tapped without warrants.
1	OMG SO TRUE!!! Two of my friends chose to be asian, my mom chose to be a woman, and my PE teacher chose to be black. OMGZZ@! YOURE SO RIGHT!!!	I'm betting the percentages are something like 10% or less have no choice...90% or more choose to be gay.
0	why are you trying to turn this into a religious debate? no one said anything about finding jesus. all you have done is show your anti-god prejudice.	so if he 'found jesus' he could be the president?
0	this an example of what i am saying you choose to ignore the moral command from the ot to burn witches whereas in the middle ages that moral command was followed this passage also mentions that you must pay taxes as well, are you rebelling against god if you complain about the redistribution of wealth through taxation if it set by the governing authority ? i also believe that passage can cause all sorts of problems, for example a fascist regime is a governing authority should you submit to a government that is morally unjust ?  bad in general, and no i don't think the same. as i said i have started to modify my socialist principles, i have a great sympathy for the anarchist way of thinking. where the state is a way to oppress the masses.	next they should repent and receive christ for the forgiveness of their sins, like all christians should.
1	Oh.. that makes sense. Because, it sounds exactly like modern day republicans.	Generally creationists follow an ideology which forbids questioning of beliefs, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly..
0	Maybe you are having trouble with the concept of "low premium, high deductible". That means the monthly payments (premiums) are low, and the deductible is higher (cost you actually pay for services). This shouldn't be a problem. How often do you actually use your health insurance? I use mine very rarely (not at all in the last year). It appears that what Bush is trying to do is get insurance coverage to low income folks without a multi trillion dollar price tag (like kerrys plan carries). This isn't a bad thing, and I am not even a bush supporter.	nslation: the government will tell the citizens what kind of bank account they need to get to save up for their own health costs -- then pay it yourself.
0	But bestiality consists of animal cruelty, so very much hurts another. Just not another human.	bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments, since their logic is about the same (i.e., not illegal, not hurting anyone else), and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future.
1	If the same question had been posed by different polls over time it would be easier to draw trends from the responses..... but good luck with finding some trends in amongst that lot.	If I get a chance (I am at work) I will make a post showing what I mean by trend...However, looking at it now..it really means nothing because all the polls seem messed up.
1	wow, so you're saying that christianity should be able to stand the test of extreme scrutiny? are you trying to use this as an excuse to bash it time and again? great idea! i think you should spread the wealth a little! bash some hindus and buddhists and jews! oh, wait- no that is discrimination!!! you racist! i think that christianity has definitely should the test of extreme scrutiny long enough! millions of christians have been killed in history as martyrs.	if christianity is a worthy religion, it will stand the test of extreme scrutiny.

1	Never thought of that. If that "person" has rights, do they have responsibilities? Could a fetus be charged for causing toxemia? How about suing the little tyke for giving mom varicose veins and stretch marks?	First of all we don't know if a soul even exist, and secondly, even if we had proof that it did, we have no way of knowing when it becomes reality for that person.

0	No, there isn't a consensus among Christians, at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing. There is no consensus about method.	Is there not a consensus among Christians concerning creationism?
0	It can go both ways. We all doubt. It is what you do with it that matters.[QUOTE=gnojek]If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort?Is faith some innate human tendency?It could be seeing as how there is the "god spot" in the brain, but maybe the god spot wouldn't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural.QUOTE]Look around. Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air. It is obviously part of our psyche. Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith. Even on different sides of the planet.It's as natural as the sun rising.	But why do you think that doubt limits people's ideas?If anything it helps to expand them.
0	It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft.Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i don't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves(a basic human right) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours.Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since?	It sounds icky, and is to a degree but seems better than feeding them to maggots or just burning them.Fair enough if you want have it as an option like Organ Donors but seems the same thing really to me, especially as there are babies that die because they need immediate organ or tissue donors after being born.Its the allegations of babies being killed to fund this I doubt, seems to be an attempt to sensationalise a piece of news.
1	You're equating atheism and homosexuality with terrorism and drug dealing? Really? Can you stop being a reactionary dolt long enough to convince me you're worth even trying to converse with? If not, I'll understand... and not be surprised.	Well if they're gonna be shelling out that shellac on a shingle for atheists, homosexuals, pedophiles, abortionists, special interest groups, terrorists, pornographers, business owners, prostitutes, drug dealers, illegal immigrants, dictators, the Untied Nations, and ACORN...then is it really too much to ask them to extend the same courtesy to people who actually believe in the Constitution?
1	No - but they certainly have a bias. As do we all.	You are not implying that Catholics shouldn't have the right to use the media to put forth ideas on politics, culture, and society are you?
0	Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion. In typical fashion you make claims which you don't support at all. Here is my post below, point out WITH EVIDENCE!!! what I am distorting in any way; especially that which I hold dear. In other words, write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack. emoticonXDonno	This is why religion may not survive the future.People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.The only hope is if the nuts stop making it in to an adversarial situation.Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, but that is already clear to anyone who knows his work here.

0	We cannot prove the existence of God for, by definition, he dwells in a reality outside our own. Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace, nor can I disprove it, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists, by definition, in Hyperspace.I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe. A round square, a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously, you name it.	If God exists, and he wanted his existence proven, he could prove it.
0	Intelligent design comes in many flavors too.ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?	What about other 'rational' alternatives to your version of evolution; such as that postulated by ID theorists?
1	i find it funny you think article v was repealed yet the bill of rights references article v for passage.  so we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but article v which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? you've really lost it haven't you. what do you mean 'sos' by the way? save our ship haha? i have been saving your ship.	if you can repeal the bor, any one of them there is nothing to stop you from repealing the articles either is there?

1	you mean pascals sucker bet? if arch is wrong, he's wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood, a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their 'flocks'. he's prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured.  furthermore, he's extolling others to do so also. because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold, they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude.	can you provide scriptures that confirm that the ungodly will be tortured for eternity in indestructible bodies?
0	oh yeah, i forgot that you believe that the corporate media and corporate leaders have gotten together to create war and put innocents in jail. i will admit that the powers of the executive branch have gone way too far, but i still believe that being at war means we have to treat the enemy like our enemy, and not like american civilians. do i agree with the war? no. but that's only because i feel that we could have done this all with special forces and not with an invasion/occupation. i would still support detaining terrorists captured in battle/mission (and if they're americans, give them a proper trial, not a military tribunal or some bullshit like that).	really, oh well when you put it that way, actually just out of curiosity who are you fighting against, oh yeah, a tactic called terrorism which you use more than any other nation on earth.
1	Oh come on. If those words were hateful, then you need to 'investigate' probably millions of people, because those are pretty normal sentiments. Canada must have a LOT of tax dollars. I don't entirely agree with what he said either, but I think it's downright scary that your govt. investigates something like that.	This does not mean all hate speech will be illegal, only that there are limits.
1	You mean you're for real? You're not setting out deliberately to make creationists look as if they don't know what they're talking about? Because that's all you're achieving.  Still no source for the trillions, I see.	ya try again.. im 18 and still in high school.. wanna try again with that scientist bit?
0	What we have here is simply a perspective problem, which is the problem with most debates. I see the Bible as sound, and every "error" in the Bible I have researched (I have admittedly not researched them all) have been refuted.	What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be.
0	So everyone thinks that "evolutionists" should seize power or something? If that is true, it is because evolution is very widely accepted.	The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless.
0	i guess this disease is 'contagious' thus due to this contagious disease it can spread rapidly. if he dies then no one gets infected and vice versa. although, i believe that if that is the situation i don't the infected persons opinion matters. if you possibly may kill even 1 person you will probably be isolated from social world and be taken to a place where you have no contact with the public no questions asked.	i think it would make a difference!
0	Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.	We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution,
0	And what if it is one to me? Then your refute is equally refuted. The support for us not knowing lies in you and other's inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person. Your own inability is my support.	I tell you now, a fetus is not morally a person to me.
0	The comic relief doesn't even recognize it has passed in on, or attempted to!	I don't know, yours is overwhelming, who gave it to you?
0	Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events.	What is supposed to take thousnds/ millions of years for populations of animals to evolve has just taken a swift punch to the gut by David Reznick.
1	If I ever need a kidney to live, I know who to tell them to harvest from... whether or not you agree to it :P	No...this kills a kid....I don't see why anything would trump the right to live.
1	And it remains to be seen if your are. Pick an unreasonable and dumb argument go with it.	Many evolutionists are pretty bright, yes, No one can deny that.
1	Born again? Pardon me for getting it right the first time. ;)	Not out loud mind you, but He guides me on a moment by moment basis.
0	You misunderstand me I believe they should all be locked up. Anyone who preaches against gay people freely living their lives as equal citizens with all the rights and responsibilites should be locked up in the darkest dungeon. There can be no compromise on this issue peoples lives are at stake.	If Canada limited it's persecution only to those who are trying to change the law, there wouldn't be a problem.
0	I don't know if you ever heard of the UK Poll Tax but I could have seen myself protesting by non-payment against such a grotesquely unfair system of taxation had I been of the age to do so.	Lets say your tax rate is 25% but you thought that was too much, would you just pay the amount you felt was fair?
0	Bellesiles claimed his data was destroyed in a flood. Lott claimed his data was destroyed in a computer crash. Some people have been calling John Lott "the Bellesiles of the Right." Read this article "The Bellesiles of the Right? Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data."http://slate.msn.com/id/2078084/John Lott has already admitted to inventing a fan (Mary Rosh) to praise himself. That's intentionally trying to deceive people. http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp...&notFound=true	There maybe something wrong with it, but "thinking someting is wrong" and actually being wrong are two different things.Bellesiles is most definately a liar and there is no debate or confusion about it.
1	Ha, that is just an idiotic perspective. We'd have no laws (and many important ones) if you can't make a bill that doesn't affect you. Sorry Civil Rights legislation!	Politicians that propose anti-gun legislation don't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect, they shouldn't be allowed to propose it.
0	What would you know about fair and balanced?emoticonXCensoredI know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?	I didn't think posters were required to "balance" their opinions here.At least now we see what passes for "moderation" on this board.
0	Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim, that can be refuted through logic, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct.This new claim is an interesting one that I have seen others use. I'll tell you on what basis. Based on reason. To hold that nothing can be known for certain, is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense. I'll start a thread about this claim, it's a hot topic to be sure!	Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?
0	Working on it. Apparently we are still waiting for to to be graded (it was really big, at leat 20 typed pages). I plan on buying from them when they get it back, and maybe putting up a whole page in honor of it. Partly because I think it is very telling, partly because I remember what it was like to be in college and get a little recognition for your work.	or if he would not like to, would you ask him is people can request a copy?
1	It appears that peddler is finally open to learning new things! (Unless, of course, peddler is simply being facetious... which is not obvious from the immediate context.)	I did not know that.
0	your probably referring to the mexican basin crater. mass extinction doesn't prove evolution. the flood as described in the Bible is an example of mass extinction. besides, in order for the asteroid theory to work, the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning. also similiar to the effects of the flood.	The mass extinction is a fact and so is evolution.
1	i'm shocked! shocked, i say!!! you seem so pure! roflmao....sorry!	i prefer to date someone and if 'it' happens it happens
0	I think a free society works better by saying "You have to have at least a certain variety to give your customers a choice in products". Businesses should have the restrictions, not private citizens.	If you go around saying "you must do it this way" then you really aren't a free society but you have the government controlling instead.
0	Can we get away from quoting 5 year old posts? Seriously, if you don't take the time to actually read the thread why should I respond to your post?	I wouldn't say one can't be a Christian if they support abortion but I find it really hard to understand how one justifies or rectifies it with the Bible or their faith.
0	Actually, I've heard it all before and it is wrong. The article is full of misinformation and misrepresentation. It is, as you say, slanted rather than an honest report of the data.	Not that anyone here cares to read the Creationist slant on soft tissue found in dinosaurs...but here it is
1	You really are an idiot if you think China follows Jefferson	so then what did Greece and Rome contribute except what not to do?????
1	Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis.	Also, given that you don't like his stated position on gay marriage (i.e., that marriage is a state issue), it appears to me that you don't like democracy either.
1	Right, expect when talking about the 14th amendment. The way you guys like to define "equal protection" would make it so any restriction is unequal.	No one I know on my side argues simply for "equality in marriage", period full stop.
0	I think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited. Space, time, energy, matter and laws all came into existence together. Of course that's impossible for us to envisage....	the problem then is, how could the universe begin in the midst of absolutely nothing (no time, no matter, no space, no energy)?
0	And it is. The ToE is a theory, however. It explains evolution, which has been observed. Do not attempt to deny that.	Evolutionists, in an attempt to win converts, have a habit of saying evolution is a fact.
1	You said there wasn't a pro-choice group before Roe v Wade. However I would have to do my research to dig up a group in 1850. Hold on...	show me the pro-choice group from 1850 please.
1	Yeah guess that probably makes me a gun-toten redneck drunk,shooten everything in sight huh.emoticonXKillemoticonXGood	He will count drinking and gun owning as doing both at the same time, kinda like winnie the mute did.
0	Actually, everything the bible say's belies your "atheist answer". The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident. It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior, but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life.	Theist answer: the bible says that without faith its impossible to please God, and since the bible also says that the bible is God's true word, then we only need faith to believe the bible and by extension to believe in God.
0	On an internet forum why is that so important? The bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is, but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he isn't and adjust accordingly.My guess is this is not the only place this happens. These things happen, you fall, you get up, people laugh, you move on, you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up. Just depends on who you want to be.Sorry I am a sucker for empty milk crates. Can't seem to walk by one without jumping on and taking her for a spin.	I agree, but when you know your opponent will succeed in making you look weak if you give them the chance, trying to look like the bigger man will do Jack for you.

0	Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the "friendlyatheist.com" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/But then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist. emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead	Where better to find more info on the evolutionary migration of humanity than from friendly atheist.com.
0	why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent.	for example, when you have a healthy marriage, children will generally model themselves after their parents (disclaimer note i said 'generally' there are exceptions, however disclaimer).

And since I'm sure Steeeeve (the dictionary worshipper) will step in, here is the definition:	But what you don't seem to get is that this will probably happen by default.
1	i do not understand how sexism, slavery and filicide fit into a being that is supposed to be infinitely moral. care to justify that for me? oh wait... you can't.	yes, practices at the time condoned many of the things you state, but the bible was about jesus with many of the practices of the time added as historical color not relevant to the actual text itself.
0	well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort.	so where is voting being used as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay rights movement?
0	This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.	There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists... unless you first believe through faith that God exists.
1	You'll never have that problem comic relief. You'll always be young mentally.	I had to laugh at that piece of projection.
1	Well if you already know you're for guns, then you should know the basic reasons, right? Or was this an uninformed decisions (I heard from my friend that guns are good)? But basically other people have said it. They're protected by the Constitution, they generally result in lower crime rates, and they can be used for defense as well as hunting. Oh, but the burden of proof isn't on the people supporting guns, but those who wish to ban guns. Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable.	Can you all just tell me if you are for guns or not and a short reason why?Thank you.
1	Waxy:  Why are you standing by saying nothing while one of your own is continuing to show how ignorant he is by asserting Isochron was not used at KBS Tuff ?  Ray M.	if you aren't willing to answer questions or provide proof of your assertions, how is it possible to have a debate in good faith?
0	No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed. It does not mean that "life is irreducibly complex" since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion. And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like "pieces that happen to be fitted together". More and more like a complex kludge. Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one!	Life, as is the genome, is a system -- an irreducibly complex system -- not an assortment of pieces that just happen to be fitted together over time via random genetic changes culled by nonrandom death.

0	Forgive me if this seems picky, but I just want to try and fully understand this argument. I should say that I don't necessarily agree with it, and would like to respond as to why. I just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that I can make a sound response.As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.... Where does this right originate from, i.e., is it from the US Constitution via the 14th amendment etc?

0	surely, we can only 'guesstimate' how many living species have escaped our attention ? but how probable is it that only 1% of all the species that ever existed escaped extinction ?  i think your point about mass extinctions may be a key to what has puzzled me.	the number of living species that have escaped our attention cannot compare to those that have gone extinct over several billion years of life with numerous mass extinctions, remembering that fossils are rare.
0	Actually, the answer might depend more on the nature of the question, or the particular religious cult of the person being asked, etc. In questions of science, fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture.On the other hand, you are characterizing religion as insanity. I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science, then that is insane.	If I was to ask a religious person of a provable way that he found out about his belief he would have to say that he was told.
1	That post is not only off topic, but yet a further example of your being completely out of touch with reality.	<Flush>People can speak well and be blooming imbeciles, like the left wing loons who think the right for individuals to bear arms is dangerous.What's dangerous are the liberal dweebs who are bankrupting the country with their cradle to grave entitlement programs to the point where we're going to have to start gutting our military just to pay the interest on the debt Obama is running up.
1	Yep, so much for a pastor knowing his sheep(le).  It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.  What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???  As to this case.  I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.  But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock.	if it is true that having a membership of over 2000 members means that you 'really have no idea who is walking through your doors,' then it's not an argument for armed guards; it's an argument against big crowds.
0	i'm totally surprised i've posted so many posts in this thread: not like me at all.	assuming you were correct about the experiment, were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of, a large variety of fruit flies to begin with, random mating, etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies, did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that?

An Einstein, of course, is much more useful to a much greater number of people, but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person, I would say not.	if a woman is raped, and a two year old is raped, is it not an equally bad crime considering the two year old didn't understand what was happening?I have the same view on abortion.
0	wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions	What you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality?

1	then explain why the moon isn't burning, after all, it's significently larger then any known comet.  this is beyond ignorant. explain how something far smaller then the moon could sustain nuclear fusion for millions of years yet brown dwarfs which are larger then the moon can't.  coronal mass ejections are not even similar to comets. we have evidence of what comets are. spectrum analysis of light given off by vaporization tells us exactly what they are made of. given your comments, i'm not surprised that the scientific contributions of the islamic world over the past 50 years have essentially been nothing.	moreover, i only ask could it possible that such masses separated from the sun, may retain some of the nuclear property of the sun, and could this explain the radiation that once had been found at tunguska?

0	Well, by the strict defintion of the word "born", an abortion is considered a premature birth.	Now, if the mother chooses to abort that person will not be born.
1	Oh you do love to do the psychological technique known as 'transference' don't you...or is it 'projection'???   You are so obsessed with gay sex, I would not be surprised if you and Ted Haggard have a lot to talk about.	emoticonXHohoTrebor is certainly a hypocrite.
0	No one said he invented guns!A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[1] To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[1][2]	Except for the fact that guns were around long before Browning was ever born.
1	Hardy, har har! It is nice to see sinjin is still "hanging" around :)	The comment in red is your response.Now, anyone with a modicum of knowledge of the English language knows that the "THEY" you are referring to is the subject of my preceding statement "gang bangers".
0	The criminals in DC already have their guns. All striking down DC's handgun ban will do is let the law abiding be able to better defend themselves and be armed for a change.	The court will not hear the case so more guns on the street emoticonXKill
0	Listen, I have forgotten more than you will ever learn about what is real and true in this world, so either back up your insults with facts or get lost because It is becoming painfully obvious that attempting to reason with you is an exercise in futility. kind of like trying to travel from point A to point B on a merry-go-round.	Perhaps too much bible has rotted your brain?
0	It doesn't matter whether it is religous or not. The odds of anyboy being fired over such a thing are slim to none. Morning after pills can not possibly make up eough of any given pharmacys revenue to make it worth the expense of replacing a skilled employee.	In that case it may not be illegal, but if I got that in writing, that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim, it makes it easy to fire them since it's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons (race/religion/color, etc.)
1	Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained.	I mean i understand if you do but I would like to make some points about it.....there are also some points procing creation.
1	That would be the fault of you rather than us. Everyone knows a small mind can't see what's beyond it's comprehension level.	maybe the ammo has gone to your brains and the lead has really affected you gun loonies, for there is no much sign of intelligence in any of you.
1	i love how the apple fan is illiterate. what exactly is the great thing that apple invented?	samsung produces apple clones for several years, they have ideas or concepts on they own.
0	if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation (i,e., six days, man from dust, fruit of good and evil) then what is its use? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated, or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical? genesis 1&2, in the literal application, has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without: 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises. now if genesis has it wrong, then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible? from all scientific perspective, genesis 1&2 never happened, and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned.	should modern science be able to prove without the shadow of a doubt that man evolved from amoeba, reptiles, animal life into what he is today, orthodox theology would be able to make the transitional acceptance far more readily than western theology for all the reasons stated above.
1	Hey, Jack, in case it missed your expert scrutiny, I'm first normally responding to some pro-gay argument that's referenced in a great many of those posts. There's scores of you guys defending such iniquity at any given time. Just look at the last twenty posts and it's five or more of you pro-gay pundits vs. one or two respondents. Seems to me it your cause to promote and defend, just like we're seeing across America. Make you guys a deal: You shut up about it and it will greatly please me to never mention it. I don't suppose you will ever do that now, will you? LOL!	And no, I didn't take the time to count them individually: just go to the members' list and sort by number of posts.
1	Not only would I throw the switch, I'd pay the electric bill, too. emoticonXGood	He loves to pull the executioner's switch.
1	If we did not have criminals, we wouldnt have "shoot outs" as you so call them.	2) More guns and have more shootouts between the bad guys and good guys.
0	Gary Ridgway, the serial murderer of some 60 or more women, possibly more.	Gary Ridgway could be more insane that Andrea Yates, but he was punished and she was not.
0	It's been reported in the Telegraph as well as several other news outlets. Want to slander them as well or do you want to try to disprove their story based on its content. I suggest the former, because the University has already confirmed the authenticity of the e-mails and documents. emoticonXRolleyes	Ah so, the extremely biased right wing rag owned by cult leader Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church cult which believes that Moon is the Christ.
1	How do you know if they WANT to believe in a deity? They simply don't.	Second, the majority of the world believes there is a god, and the others don't want to believe (hope there isn't) a god
0	In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.	Would you care to support that claim with actual evidence or is it your intent to once again just lump everyone on the Right into the same pot of Funamental Christianity so as to slander us all as a group ?
1	You forgot about the youth recruitment efforts as well. I am president of the local chapter of "Get 'Em While They're Young." Our mission (agenda, if you will) is to recruit and convert the kids in an effort to increase the prevalence of homosexuality to 20% by 2015, then 51% by mid-century when we will have total control, muahahahahaha!!!	The Gay agenda has been to normalize homosexuality and what better way to do it than to indoctrinate the young and desensitize them to the negatives of the lifestyle while they're still impressionable.
0	oh yeah! i remember that one... abbynestor was going off on everyone, so i told to to calm down and then everyone (including the people she was ripping on) starting yelling and calling me a dick.  like honestly dana got called a bunch of nasty stuff, i try to defend her and she gets snappy with me...like what? that's why i'm going to stay away from that stuff now.	yeah and there was one debate that i had to stop because it was getting out of hand.
1	You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic? Talk about ABORTING.	poor boo-boo...You want to talk pain?I wish the pro-infanticide zealots could experience being dismembered and having their skulls collapsed and their brains sucked out so they'll know what an innocent baby feels when it's being aborted.
1	Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!	Okay, let's look at evolution.
1	I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.	The first reasonable alternative explanation is that it never happened as alleged.
0	oh really? stop lying to yourself pal. http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/shouldzoophiliazoosexualitybelegal http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       should itbelegaltohavesexwithdogs_3	you need to stop lying to yourself.
0	The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved (even on the balance of probabilities) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith.	Where does one need faith, exactly, to make claims about evolution (hint: faith is not needed).
1	In the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt.	Even better were does it say that evolution is proven?
1	Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.	Actually no such right exists, for you or anybody else.
0	Not sure how you can tell that since very little is mentioned about his methods.	His method appears to be good, i.e.
1	wow, this was up to 6 points at one time. down-voting it without a rebuttal surely refutes it.	until such time this burden of proof is satisfied, the logical position is the position of skepticism.
0	Might be something to be said for that. Are there any studies that show possible causes of suicide?	...is that they think that ...they aren't loved...
0	Come on, people. You don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. There's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. And if no one else would have, I would have.	He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child.
0	What basis do fundamental rights derive from? In other words, how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right?	If you think about it, slavery requires life.
0	I would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then. That is a new species, and it is not man doing it, but rather nature itself.	Besides observing it, the way to demonstrate evolution is to manipulate a species until it developes into a new species, but alas, then all you will have proven is directed efforts of intelligent beings create species.
0	like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized. http://kevinantoine.com/holytrinity.htm now why does that matter? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man. you have made absolutely no progress towards that end. do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility.	what do you care if i type it out or someone else does, as long as you get the information?
1	So what's your point, Bush is as Liberal as the most Liberal Senator in Congress?	If that isn't appeasing liberals and moderates, what is?
1	you really need to stop reading such biased, uninformed digital-age fishwrapper. i can think of at least one instance off the top of my head, justice alito's confirmation. the democrats threatened to filibuster bush's scotus choice. the gang of seven democrats agreed not to filibuster in return for the republicans not to use the 'nuclear option'. it was in all of the papers. i'm surprised that the leftwing rag missed it. emoticonxrolleyes	as ed says to joan -- the key question she never answers while disagreeing with dean -- is when did the republicans ever need 60 votes under george bush?
0	No, it's often an emotional show. They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing. The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him. There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticonXWow	Note that I`m not saying there is anything wrong with displaying emotions unless your drunk or hung-over, I cry even when I`m not hung-over I`ve just noticed this weird relationship between movies or tv-shows, crying and hang-overs.
1	Math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it.	It really is confusing.
0	should we clear up what we're talking about at all? i think adultery is legal in 24 states, and i'm pretty sure adultery laws have been pretty much completely unenforced since world war ii. i don't know of any states where a polygamous relationship with no marriage involved is illegal. now, certainly having multiple marriage licenses is illegal...	that is why i said if i saw a polygamous marriage situation, i would contact the authorities, because in more cases than none; young women are being taken advantage of by someone much older; the tom green situation.
1	yes, it's david koresh's fault that the fbi burnt children alive, right? disgusting. however evil or deluded david koresh might have been, nothing he did compares to gassing and then setting on fire large numbers of children, an act you apparently applaud.	the fault is the cult's, not those that came to enforce the law and were met with gunfire.
1	Well if it's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades? And while you're at it, supply the names of the companies who're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions.	So easy to do in America, a nation which refuses to acknowledge the need for responsible gun ownership.
0	Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory. Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved.	Do not deceive yourself into thinking that "literal" Biblical Creation would be proved true if evolution were proven false.
0	Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again.	Are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions?
1	really? damn! i wanna be awesome too. are you selling awesomeness or do i have to develop it on my own? if it's a lot of work, i might just settle on being mediocre.	but i will tell you i'm pretty awesome.
1	Aw shucks! And I reckon in Kansas they won't ever care whether or not you learn how to spell ATHEIST.	All we wanted was a little balance between science and faith and for that balance to be initially manifested from the bottom up, not from the top down, which has been the case ever since the materialists and athiests.
0	So the stats come from John Lott.... Wasn't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause? http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may...on/oe-wiener31http://whoismaryrosh.com/....a bizarre individual who I don't think can be trusted.	http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdgcon.htmlWhat is so doubtful about it?
1	No, this is the point of the 10th amendment. Article 1 Section 8 applies to Congress...the 10th amendment grants all powers not listed to the states or people.   The 14th amendment is not the "federal government can do whatever" amendment.	The constitution does not allow states to do whatever they want for what they may call the general welfare.
1	Is it possible to be an adult and be as clueless as you seem to be?  This was in response to the question did Jesus not believe in evolution.  Only someone with similar mental capacity to yours would ask such a question.  It seems unfair I have to answer this senseless comment you added to the nonsense.	and the validity of your arguement here rests upon the yec reading of genesis, so it is not conclusive.
0	i agree with you dear... good reply of question... :)	have you tried clicking on ' my profile' then' find latest posts' jet?
1	oh really? then why don't we go naked and live in a forest or jungle? ................ i did not mean to say that i say we are different but the same.	====================================== just because they can't say no they still show that they don't like it.
1	Or maybe they do? Could this sick, perverted individual be the spokesperson for the so called "gay movement"?	No pro-gays printed it!Maybe because they don't agree with it
1	So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed?	at least not the kind you chance-worshiping evolutionists want.
0	too right. l. ron hubbard is the closest thing the modern world has to jesus: skeezy, probably un-bathing, secretly greedy but always with a generous front. well, i guess mother theresa would be a close second to l.ron h. xenu.	the fact that it still exists in modern society is just a sign of how idiotic people can be.
0	So what? If somebody wants to die then they'll kill themselves no matter what.	Now firearm deaths in the US in 1999 totalled 28,874 of which more than 16,500 were suicides, 10,800 murders and the rest accidental or undetermined.
1	Yep, Martha is in trouble and the democrats are panicking.   I think the strong Independent support for her opponent is due to Martha's own lack of appeal.   By they way, I have to ask....since "The anointed one" was in your neck of the woods, did you get a peek at him? prehaps even wave at him (with all 4 fingers) ;)	Maybe that is the way it is done in Chicago or some third world country run by a dictator.
1	i have never heard a conservative who was pro gay let alone pro same sex marriage. do you know of any? there is an old term that seems to apply 'if the shoe fits'. please i would like to know who these conservatives are that want gay people to be able to legally marry. who are they? since as you say i speak in generalities then you should have no problem listing these pro gay or por gay marriage conservatives. just because someone believes that the government should not be in the marriage busisness, as a libertarian, doesn't mean they support gay marriage.	it doesn't matter if you think he did or not, imo he did.
0	simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately.	if those of my chosen party have made the claims that we want criminals, terrorists and the others in these categories to have guns, then i'd like to see them.
0	You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved.	Right or wrong for them, it's their decision to make, not yours or mine, and none of our business.
0	Except that the word for day in Genesis 1 is 'yom' and was understood to be a twenty-four hour day.	The meaning of the word "day" in the language the Bible was written in means basicly "a long period of time".
1	So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?  Interesting...	and i sincerely do say this out of love.
0	So there you have it: AMENDMENTS ARE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION.	The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution.
1	The Archbishop of York has a screw loose too on that subject.	and whereas our fellow poster Easyrider 'knows' that the bible condemns sexually active gays, the Archbishop of York declared last week that the christian attitude was welcoming acceptance.
1	By your own admission you haven't 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?	however, they do tend to stay with their own.
0	what is the big deal here? so eharmony doesn't cater to gays. (there are also gay-only services out there that don't cater to straights.) if anyone doesn't like the service, they don't have to use it.	i thought this was a great artical and great spot.
1	Never heard of him...however, looks like those ever-loving proponents of free speech up in Canada showed Anne Coulter that 'free-speech' is Only what liberals make it to be.....	Ah, another proponent of nastiness.Say hello to your Hitler-loving brother in Pinson, Alabama, Mike Vanderboegh.
1	i just love how you attempt to be mr. forum police here steve. if you want to be a moderator so bad why not apply? i'm certain this board could use the help. as far as your scenario it's rather laughable but whatever. point being is if people demand evidence why not give them that? i'd rather be an open honest man than hide behind a handle any day.	not only that, you don't know how that might come back on the owner of this forum.
1	Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional.	The fact that somebody believes in intellient design does not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution.
0	baby, i am going to publicly say that if it wasn't for you i would be so out of here . oh yeah and for merlin too	i just wish we could get billie back.
1	If I thought you'd understand in the least bit why it's important to scrutinize possible occupants of the White House, I'd explain how I feel about. However, you are a hopeless case.	What in the heck does it have to do with the Whitehouse ?
1	For one to have evolution as their foundation belief, means that one cannot be certian of anything.....	Maybe your definition are in a sense better but many people adopt the position that when someone defines things you interept them using their defintions AND THEIR DEFINTIONS ALONE.
0	is this a case of the truth hurting? then i guess it would work both ways. how do you feel about 'christians' slagging off non-believers, declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god? conceited? yup. could i give a toss? nope. how do you think non-believers feel about the smugness of christians? and it's not just me who thinks they're fairytales and that christians are delusional, as you well know. so why personalise it? apart from that, a lot of us here have a thick skin. this is a debating forum, and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others.	they and millions like them would not consider them as fairy tales and would feel insulted by your attitude in this respect.
1	i just told you how. if you want to change your gender, then go ahead... but comparing it to changing clothes is just idiotic.  oh yeah! i forgot, you already think the entire human race is stupid... so i guess you have an excuse.	we are control of our own lives and if we want to change ourselves we have all right to do so.
