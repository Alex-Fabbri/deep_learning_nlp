0	good question.  let us say that dawkins is my teacher.  in the ben stien interview , dawkins said that evolution is fact, as much of a fact, as we can know anything to be a fact... ok?!?! dawkins also says that we do not know how life originates from inornanic, nonliving compounds and he says, that, he doesn't know and no one else does either. ok!!?! well i do not accept that as an explanation - so - i guess i am not blindly following this irrational line of logic. i would have to say that - i am not being 'indoctinated'. at the same time, dawkins has nothing to teach me so i guess i am not being 'educated' either. hmmm. i guess i would have to say that in this case i am - neither.	how very true. care to guess on which side you fall?
0	you wouldn't be a commodity at all if you weren't willing to sell, you'll be hunted though. i guess you could rent out your labor for a time if you somehow didn't get hunted and weren't willing to sell your genetic material.	why would you sell your genetic advantage to other people? you would become a lot less valuable commodity.
0	not according the SCJ of Mass. This was part of the grounds of their ruling FOR marriage in Mass.	That ruling was based on race, not gay marriages.Totally different.
0	and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant.	it may help to look at election in this way (wow, i almost wrote evolution emoticonxic)... god is deserving of all glory. in fact, because god is ultimate perfection, he seeks to glorify himself. because humans are not god, we are not deserving of his glory. in order for god to demonstrate his glory, through his characteristic of justice, he allows us to go to hell. however, another characteristic of his glory is that he is merciful. in his mercy he chooses some to be saved and with him in heaven. thus two of his characteristics are being glorified (mercy and justice).
1	a majority of the planet believes in a higher power, so i allready have the majority agreement on this. how about you come up with a test to see if god doesnt exist... well? i'm waiting.	ok, since according to your claim, god is a natural part of us and everything in our universe, you can come up with a way to test for that claim. define 'god' that will get at least a majority agreement on. develop a test for god. find a testable statement, if proven true, disproves god. when you have those, then i will accept your claim.
1	Like I said, Catholic school. Or it could be that you're like 80 years old or something, because nowadays, if you talk about God or the Bible, then you don't get in trouble, you get criticized and made-fun-of, not only by your peers, but also by teachers.	i was shut down, yelled at, and they sent home a disaplinary referal form (trouble). they tell me what to believe.

1	You mean the guy who didn't tell his own cabinat he was going to Argentina to go get a little.. and left a power gap because no one knew where he was? You mean that guy?  That is a heck of a lot worse that actually having an affair. Eliot Spitzer at least had the decency to resign when he got caught being a hypocrite.   I personally don't care about his diddling with some woman.. although it does make him a hypocrite since he ran on the 'family values' campaign. It's that little thing about leaving his duties behind without communication that is the real destruction the public trust.	and ny and nj are any better? and 'cheating on his wife mark sanford' has to do what with electing big blabbermouths with nothing to say and absolutely nothing in the brainbox? sorry baby you're caught.
0	Falling, the fact that the homeschoolers you mentioned don't choose to socialize with you, doesn't mean they're not far more capable of functioning in the "REAL WORLD" than you might think. I would not choose to socialize with you in the "REAL WORLD", and you most likely would not choose to socialize with me, but that does not make me your social inferior!	actually, i know a lot of homeschoolers that went to my church. they are all very very socially incapable of doing much of all. i'm sorry, but thats how it is. i know almost as a fact that they would be much better off if they were not protected by their parents and allowed to live in the real world. maybe you are in the minority.
0	Actually, no. If it had not been for the gay couples and the organizations who helped them fight for equality it wouldn't be an issue now, but it would still be an issue.	Had it not been for Activist judges in Mass. and and activist mayor in Sodom (SF) trolling for votes gay marriage would not even be and issue......

0	you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons.	lockheed martin rolls out poland f-16, nato's most advanced fighter. you know militarization of poland start to threaten me considering that this neighboring country (i live in east germany) began to receive first f-16s from the lot of 48 airjets that american corporation lockheed martin is producing fur poland. i hope i will give voice to the general opinion of european union if i say that poland failed to conciliate with old europe. what if poland will try to dictate terms to us demonstrating its newest weapon obtained from americans? it is clear that poland is a conducter of washington's will and ambitions in respect of the future of european union and they don't even try to conceal the fact that they see poland a wouldbe leader of europe which will certainly mean the end of eu as such. america will swallow us with the help of its weasel poland
1	And we all know when you say "We" you mean your buddies the Mormons and their Money are the ones voting down such bills.. It's just a matter of time before people start to wake up.

0	if you check again you will find they do have self defense shootings in the list as well as accidents. the point is, as even you have now pointed out, the number is flawed. the source, vpc, knowingly used false data to further their claim. therefore eliminating any validity to their claim.  you and brady continue to trot out biased and inaccurate sources to back your arguement. you should stop, it does great harm to your credibility. wow, you really can leap tall mounds of logic in a single bound. what evidence do you have that any of these deaths would have been prevented by banning concealed carry? then also consider the lives saved by concealed carry, such as mine.	i checked the vpc website- the number includes 15 suicides. only a very small percentage of homicides are classified as self defense killings according to the fbi so it's improbable that most of these killings can be explained away as being self defense killings.
0	see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian.	why are there so many people that express interest in who i love? (a rhetorical question) why are there so many people that express interest in how i love? (also a rhetorical question) with all of the atrocities in this country and the world, it seems so odd that politicians and those of 'religion,' as well as the public in general, are so interested in our personal lives. why can't the politicians and those of 'religion' and the public in general place their interest in the atrocities?  and to negate an expected reply, who i love and how i love is not an atrocity in any way.

1	You question others sources and credibility yet you parade around under the name of a giant cartoon Shake?	The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves.This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.
1	only two choices? poor god, infinity reduced to black or white.	god had two choices. he could make creatures that obeyed him completely with no possibility whatsoever of choosing against his will. or he could make free creatures with the choice to love god or not. can you imagine an interesting world where there are no choices? can there be love without choice? can robots love? because adam and eve chose to disobey god they were no longer perfect. all of history since then has been god's plan to bring us back to perfection. this is the view many christians have, hope it helps you.

1	Dear god.You really haven't a clue about what your talking about.Away with the birdies i think.Yousef was responsible for the 93 bombing,and he himself had very broad associations with some of the Al-Qaeda hardcore(Osama said he didn't know him and was in Sudan while Yousef stayed in Peshewer).Osama wasn't responsible for the 93 bombing,he wasn't responsible for Bali and Madrid and i don't care what the world media tells you.But by all means keep spouting your misinformation,i for one find it hilarious.  The Yousef-Osama-Saddam link is a conspiracy theory.	yes, you are correct. i found that discrepancy and corrected my earlier post. i had not read far enough down in the original site to have seen it when i originally posted it. that's when i also was reading the other information that i linked. it gets curiorsor and curiosor. just a week or so ago fbi revealed that they had found more undiscovered explosives in the basement of mcveigh's accomplice. it's like a replay of the keystone cops.  i can't prove this but i suspect it is a lot of this information that is not widely shared and talked about that drove bush's decision to remove saddam. if in fact saddam were implicated in the earlier wtc bombing and of course he tried to murder bush #41, then bush had all the justification in the world to remove saddam.
1	What about people who believe in something so much they are willing to suffer - even die - for it? I thought you Christians were really into that kind of thing! emoticonXAngel I ask because the history of the Documentary Hypothesis is filled with those who were persecuted for daring to suggest that evidence led away from the tradition that Moses had written the entire Pentateuch. Another case of the church strangling free thought!	Bradamante: But I am already well aware of epistemological methods concerning those that seek to undermine accepted teachings...
1	of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever? the early church wasn't called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between. if imagination alone could generate heaven, you would be right. i have no reason to believe heaven exists. which are based on the beliefs of the early church, which you have already admitted existed during jesus's life time.	that's not cannibalism. if it were cannibalism jesus wouldn't have walked away from the meal. or did that cross your mind?  the catholic church wasn't the first church, unless you can show me that in the book of acts, or the gospels. it's not what they claim, but what we see in history. i imagine a great many catholics will get to heaven before you will. once again - and get this through your noggin - i base my beliefs on what's in the gospels and the new testament. john 3:36
0	Absolutely true!I discovered that with my fluoride research...For whatever reason, most people take another's word for what the truth actually is instead of searching for it themselves.If the lie is an easier pill to swallow than the truth pill, they'll take the lie. emoticonXFrazzled	Don't expect the recent retractions and exonerations to change that. One of the strongest, most-repeated findings in the psychology of belief is that once people have been told X, especially if X is shocking, if they are later told, “No, we were wrong about X,” most people still believe X. As Twain and Churchill knew, sometimes the truth never catches up with the lie, let alone overtakes it. As I wrote last summer in a story about why people believe lies even when they're later told the truth, sometimes people's mental processes simply go off the rails.
1	i love how you managed to advocate reading the bible all the while pile slamming insults on it. pure brilliance. :d	the king james version, as richard dawkins says, is the origin of hundreds of phrases and language part of our common lexicon, and to read it is to help educate yourself on some english literature. also, you can't argue against religious people unless you know what their perspective is, hence reading their books. i wish they'd return the favour. oh and, it's so much fun reading all the fucked up shit they think is morally perfect, i mean, in genesis, you have lot's daughters incestually raping him in a cave, then in exodus you've got god murdering thousands of babies, it's brilliant. oh, and the books of law are hilarious, where else can you find a moral guide that condones slavery and even gives you instructions on how to beat your slaves.
0	If substantial shouldn't be a percentage, how should it be quantified? How would you determine whether or not their prop 8 efforts were a substantial portion of their activities? And yes, as the law is currently written, it does matter how large the church is. I would suggest that those that don't like it lobby to get it changed.	" shouldn't be a percentage. By that approach, as long as religion can pull in enough $$$ in revenue, they can be as entangled into government as they like.
0	A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S.	Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.

0	Exactly. Moreover, in Emerson the discussion of the 2nd Am. is dicta (arguments not pertinent to the verdict) so it is not a binding precedent even for the courts in the same Circuit.A question for the "original intent" crowd:What did the Founding Fathers intend with the misplaced comma in the 2nd Amendment?	the only case that I know of in which a court has ruled that the second amendment is an individual right is US vs Emerson. On the other hand, I know of more than thirty cases in which the courts have supported the militia interpretation of the second amendment.

1	You mus think you're pretty smart huh? Well guess what? You're confusing common, most common, majority, and norm. Lefthandedness is considerd common and the norm. You're using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant. Good try though.  Also left handed is genetic. It's not a gene but it's genetically related to the person's physical characteristics.	so by your various definitions, left-handedness makes that person a deviant. most of america is right handed (so it would be considered the norm), left-handed people function different than right handed people as well as behave differently in the way the go about their lives. are left handed people wrong and unnatural as well? no one has determined why people are left-handed, and whether it is caused by genetics or early environmental stimuli. they are deviating from the norm. did you know that the word sinister is derived from the old english meaning 'left handed' due to old beliefs about left-handedness? do you actually (by your previous arguments) believe that left-handedness is wrong? if you don't, then you cannot possibly apply your arguments to homosexuality. if you do, i'm sorry, but you are ignorant.
0	listen if they can be nasty to me i can be equally nasty to them. what part of equailty do you not understand? equality one way or the other that is my over riding concern right and wrong are secondary.	rationalization is probably the worst way to prove what you are doing is 'ok'.  this is what you sound like 'well, billy is doing so it is ok for me to do it!'  however, if you think putting down 50% of the people is ok then good luck getting anything passed the real way. well, you are anti my morals, anti family, anti equality, anti american, anti society, anti democratic, i could go on....but you seem to be ok with this. just because you think these people are anti whatever, doesn't make it true and calling them this will further help them solidify these views.  it is so funny to watch you do the same things that you get mad at others for doing.
0	The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.	Next they've trashed God's creation by diverting everyone's attention. It's a subtle move that not many people have noticed. But I've noticed. What they've done is a clever sleight-of-hand move. Science no longer looks at animals. They no longer study how organisms interact within their environments. Instead they've turned everyone's attention to genes, bacteria and viruses….and this is because they know full-well that most people know nothing about these things….Thus, they assume (correctly, unfortunately) that most people will just take their word for it.
0	Because Apes, monkeys and chimps are on different paths. You wouldn't expect a shark to evolve into a barracuda-like animal. things evolve to fill niches, we currently fill a niche, there is nothing pushing apes, chimps or other primates to fill a niche that is occupied.	#3 - Can anyone explain to me why no other apes, monkeys or chimps have evolved into a new (i.e. human) species?
0	Well, there's also carbon dating... Didn't you post something about a decay curve? Are you now going to deny the accuracy of that?	Look at the fossil record. They say each level of earth represents millions of years....and these millions of years were necessary because it took animals that long to change via RM + NS -- and indeed it might. But heck, if variation is non-random, then it nullifies gradualism -- which nullifies the whole time-frame allocated for change in the geologic column. Then what?
0	@ raastee: i've glanced through your paper: i'm surprised you were allowed to get away with the sentence, 'irrationalism is a fallacy to be avoided'. irrationalism is not a fallacy: a fallacy is an apparently genuine but really an illogical argument. irrationalism, outside number theory, is merely a discourse or statement inconsistent with the use of reason.	yes..i wrote it for a class-philosphy. i got a 'b' for the paper and an 'a' for the class.
0	But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the "vapor canopy" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth.	Some argue that the mountains weren't that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. That's 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. That's way more then the surface of the Sun.
0	No. I will never allow "the people of the country" to tell me what is best for my my life or my health.To quote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice."I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."

0	They have changed. For example, ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species, while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species (actually, two or three species). And the differences are enough to put them in different families.By the way, ark guy, what do you know about taxonomy?	In my post I presented several reasons as to why they should have changed...everything from a changed environment down to genetic drift.
0	Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT.	How does gay legalised gay marriage=legalized polygamy? How does equal protection come into play on that equation?
0	i don't follow. 'since those of specific faith...' ???? if you don't believe god, then there is no sin. those that do would choose neither of the above over another. of course, there are some here that would, but that's religion for you.	this really would be a good question.  since those of specific faiths tout that to engage in sexual intercourse out of wedlock is bad, but still don't agree to allowing gay marriages, which would they prefer?
0	Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are "better suited" than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there?	A population of bacteria would of course be better suited than another population if it could sense light.
1	am i psychic or what! didnt i predict that there would be those who would avoid my question? am i good or what!	maybe because thats not the question. the question is, do we get to rank humans as 'worthy to live' and 'not worthy to live'. i say no.

0	But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not. And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits. Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution. Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution (along with every science) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism.	If you've noticed, I never point out the flaws in evolution to "make Creationism true."

0	Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say "What might be the best..."Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.	You can have all sorts of discussion about pain etc. You can come up with useful ways of helping people cope. However when you fully understand and aspect of pain in terms of nerve impulses and how your fancy painkiller stops them that is a better result. So restricting yourself to what you can measure can have results and should not be dismissed as "bad because all restrictions are bad".
1	Just like it's the job of the gun control lobby to try and pass an overwhelming, unreasonable level of fear of an inanimate object?

0	So gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?We are sick of conservative family types. We are tired of the closet. The phrase "we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing.	how can family values shift in a nation withint 10 years?? 10 years ago america would have never thought they wouldve needed to put Marriage Ammendments on the ballot let alone have less than 60% of the people actually vote for it. ITs sad to see a nation degrade exponentially fast and not to mention the people's consciences getting seared at the same time.Its kinda like the germans after slow and steady progress of the nazi party changed the whole nation's perspective on the jews. people that were against the nazi party 5 years prior found themselves turning jews into concentration camps. i see a similar progression beginning in america to the point that this comment itself will be bashed by those on here whose conscience has been seared to the point that they think 2 men being married is ok. If everyone in the world was gay, the human race would become extinct.Edit/Delete Message Reply With Quote

0	so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war.	how so? do you mean to treat others, better than you would have others treat you? then you are merely a perpetual victim to sociopaths. people are not always following the golden rule, and that's where the social unrest and problems start. without some degree of this a society cannot function and there would be no social cohesion and there would be constant conflict without peace.  why does it serve them to do so? it's because we are social. it's mutual self-interest, sure, but the larger human need to interact with the other is always there. no one is an island. no one is completely selfless either. we preserve ourselves, so we may realize our full potential by some degree of social interaction and co-operation.

0	It's all very interesting, but you left out a critical piece of information. You deliberately omitted the fact that most of the black victims were killed by fellow blacks. These weren't murders carried out by racist white guys, they're the examples of black on black violence.	# There were 7,387 black homicide victims in the United States. Of these, 6,345 (86 percent) were male, and 1,042 (14 percent) were female.# The homicide rate for black victims in the United States was 20.86 per 100,000. In comparison, the overall national homicide rate was 5.30 per 100,000 and the national homicide rate for whites was 3.11 per 100,000.# For homicides in which the weapon used could be identified, 82 percent of black victims (5,743 out of 7,011) were killed with guns. Of these, 73 percent (4,204 victims) were killed with handguns. There were 701 victims killed with knives or other cutting instruments, 247 victims killed by bodily force, and 200 victims killed by a blunt object. Hes betrayed his own people!

Regardless of the name change, the calendars are still keyed on the birth and death of Christ...and that will be so at least until the atheists are able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentalities.

0	oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men.	'prostitution is not a victimless crime as there are child prostitutes, and the human trafficking among other things.' the reason human trafficking if prevelent in prostitution is exactly because it is illegal. if you legalised prostitution, supply of (and demand for) native prostitutes will rise dramatically. do you not see that trafficking and child prostitution would actually be lowered by legalising prostitution? 'legalization of prostitution would lead only to ... a further spread of hiv/aids.' again, do you not see how there would actually be a reduction in sexually transmitted viruses if prostitution were regulated and legalised? the majority of problems with prostitution are directly attributed to their illegal status.

0	Yes I know, a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute Behe's work. From your link;	Intellegent Design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms, and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset. It is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence cannot be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model, then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design. When intelligent design first emerged, among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye, the flagellum and blood clotting. All of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion, and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions. These examples are summarized in wikipedia's article Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

1	Obviously sarcasm escapes you....if you did not understand that remark about gun control working in Europe during the 1930's.Report me? My knees are trembling already.I believe Steeve was expressing his right to free speech.	Well, you stated that gun control "worked well" in Europe during the 30s, which was the time of the holocaust. By stating gun control "worked well", I assumed that you supported or condoned what the nazis were doing to the Jews. However, I assume I was incorrect. And regarding you and Steeeve's childish attacks, I will ignore them at the moment, but if you decide to resume this behavior I will be forced to report it.
1	yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands. It's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves.	] How many different ways can ToE be invalidated? In a scientific theory, there are NO exceptions -- exceptions mean holes -- holes mean trouble.The answer is none so far. Your article and the mechanism involved do not impact upon TOE which makes only very broad assumptions about heritable elements. And what you reference does not constitute a hole in TOE, although it may be a new mechanism of inheritance.
0	of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong? either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. perhaps you are having a 'senior moment' and don't remember our discussion. i really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. if you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. if you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement.	quite so. i am having great difficulty understanding why you think your opinion should be made law in the universe? have you ever for a moment stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong?

After all, they are both found on the surface. But that's the logic of creationism.
1	No, no, no. If humans were created 4,000 years ago, then the earth was created 4,000 years and a few days ago. At least try and get it right.	Here (Italy), people find it hard to believe that in the U.S. creationism is taught in schools.Maybe we'll copy from You, and we'll explain our children that Eart was created some 10.000 years ago, and the human race some 4.000 years ago.
0	Again, it's not the point. There are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory	Guidance by humans in the blind Watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce . In the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection. You could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but I don't see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans. I will show youYou could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges. If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow. A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire. Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy. I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.
1	and a few posts later you whined about ad homs. maybe you could support that? perhaps you would prove to us that we are truly vile, evil, callous, despicable people that deserve to burn in the firey depths of hell for the murders that each and every one of us has committed? or perhaps you wouldn't.	pehaps he's matured to the point where carrying the power of life, or more significantly death over his neighbours, is not an ego-supporting experience
0	See my post above, Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument.	Good questions. I agree that this logic is somewhat flawed (unless quote mined). God could have made Adam and Eve. He could then have planted evidence that life evolved to this point. The miracle could have happened, too, in much the same way.
0	I don't think people have a right to kills themselves (obviously not natural and obviously not legal right now). As for the other question, I wouldn't think a blatent disregard for the others health is morally ok.	Since you brought up the questions, I wonder what your answer would be to that second question: "Can one girl kill herself or do harmful things to her body if she chooses...even against the other heads will?" Along those lines, do you support people's rights to kill themselves?
1	by your logic, do i have to be a murdered to understand that murder is wrong? this 'walk a mile in my sandals' stuff is just bs. i don't have to be a woman to view abortion as not being moral.	it is an absract concept, but i draw attention to the fact that no man can speak on this issue with the perspective that a woman can by virtue of the fact they can never be pregnant. so i suggest that it is very easy to say something is wrong when you cannot appreciate the fullness of the issue- a man will never be placed in the situation where they will be pregnant but do not wish to have a baby at that point.
1	My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.

0	very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause	if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily. If they are produced from human minds, and human minds are mutually contradictory, then how can the constructs be absolute? Therefore, the laws of logic are not human constructs.
1	More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country.	Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances.I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer. Because you're a racist.

0	I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.	Your position, it seems to me, turns on issues of quality of life and social justice such that children are entitled to either a minimum quality of life or none at all, and that preserving a woman's right to control over her body is necessary for her quality of life as an equal citizen.

0	as compared to how they would be during a period of instability? i said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is. i'm not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on.	how have things improved in saudi arabia? ahem! north korea has only had one change of leadership. therefore internally it is stable. as to causing external instability - true it does do that, but then so does the usa. causing external instability is what makes both nations evil.
0	Really? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird.	For the pro-life community, the issue comes down to the fact that every human being has intrinsic value and worth, and their life is valuable for its own sake
1	People make mistakes (excepting some pro-evolutionists who respond with anger and blame others of 'twisting their words'.)	It is called being diplomatic.

I'm open to new definitions, but this debate should not be a debate over what atheism or evolution means.

0	What if the surgery for transferring the embryo/fetus would be equal in difficulty, risk, etc. to having an abortion? There would then be no extra physical cost incurred in keeping the embryo/fetus alive. What would be the reasons, in such a case, to keep abortion as an option?	That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it.

1	A gay person is a homosexual, friend. He can't change that part about himself. He was wired that way. If you don't like the idea of gay sex, then I'd suggest you not participate in gay sex.

0	ez, can you cite an actual case where the aclu has intervened on behalf of nambla? the only person or persons with close associations to nambla that i can bring to mind is the notorious father paul r. shanley who molested countless children and was carefully sheltered under the wing of the notorious his eminence bernard francis cardinal law who was finally ousted from his cardinalship by a multitude of angry roman catholic parishioners in the boston area. dear his eminence bernard francis cardinal law was immediately taken and sheltered under the wing of the vatican and scooted over the pond to several administrative posts of the roman curia, where he was also named as archpriest of the basilica di santa maria maggiore, one of the five major basilicas of the roman catholic church.	nonsense. nambla is a criminal organization. at various times they've had articles on their website on how to seduce (illegally rape) young boys. and you and the aclu want to protect that kind of morally and legally reprehensible 'speech'? anyone with half a sense of decency wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole. only the radical left thinks that's a good cause.
0	Well... someone hasn't been following the campaigns for the so-called "protection of marriage" amendments, federal or state.	This has nothing to do with religion whatsoever.
0	i've been following the story here all afternoon bbs. i'm sorry that you're going through this, but what has scotland done to upset radical islam ? nothing that i know of. could it be they have declared war on the west in general and as a whole ? i mean, i have been told over and over again how these radical moslems are just confused souls and the real enemies we must fear are the radical conservative christians like me who actually pray for the unsaved. talk about scary people, huh ?	http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6257846.stm a terrorist attack has been carried out on the airport in the city where i live. at this time we do not know if anybody was killed, and i have a friend who was due to fly out on holiday today. i think she is okay but she will not be leaving today. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6257846.stm this attack seems to be linked to the failed attempt in london on friday.  i was going to fly from glasgow airport down to london this friday for a job interview, as glasgow airport is probably going to be closed i have decided to fly from edinburgh airport. my mother said i was crazy to fly, but the way i see it is if we live in fear to go about our daily business than these people have won
1	Someone once said that the poor would always be with us.   I'll keep in mind that your core beliefs include the notion that what the poor really need is a hard day's work. You're a prophet I tell ya!	It makes perfect sense if that is where his core beliefs are. And they are exactly there. Why do you think he told Joe the Plumber that he intended to spread the wealth around? He wants to over tax me so he can create an even larger welfare state, thereby demotivating the poor to excel and improve their lot through hard work. That is what socialism stands for that Obama is a true believer.
0	I believe it is merely all known living species against those known by the fossil record and extinct. There are undoubtedly more extinct species that we are unaware of than living ones.	I read an article yesterday (about Evolution, Extinction, and Economics) in which it was claimed that 99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct.This sort of claim (which I've come across before) troubles me: how can it be asserted, with any certainty at all:1). The number of species which have evolved.2). The percentage of that number that have become extinct.????
0	Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory.	We supposedly evolved from simplistic monkeys to what we are today.
0	But it, along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis, is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis. Actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is.	and nobody has ever managed to do so (though the concept of an invisible man in the sky is a little silly).
1	Why is it that people don't want to admit that it was Bush's' reckless spending on a War that we didn't need , the tax cuts for the richest 2 % of America, The Fact that under Bush they had to ADD space on the Debt clock, not to mention that he was as dumb as a rock, yet they can place all this blame on Obama who inherited this mess and has done more to get us out of it than Bush or any Republican would have done. Unemployment is High, we know this, but it was on it's way up when Obama took over because under Bush more corporations left this country , more businesses closed down, the Banks were allowed to do whatever they wanted without regulation of any kind, and yet none of it is his fault?.. Enlighten me...	Arnie is no conservative at all. And Nuttyfornia's legislature is Democrat. And New York's assembly has been run by Democrats since at least the 1950s.
1	you're right. god hates fags, dontcha know? it's not like hiv can be contracted by heterosexuals or anything.	update: 1 in 5 gay, bisexual men in us cities has hiv chicago, sept 23 (reuters) - nearly one in five gay and bisexual men in 21 major u.s. cities are infected with hiv, and nearly half of them do not know it, u.s. health officials said on thursday. young men, and especially young black men, are least likely to know if they are infected with hiv, according to a study by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. update 1-1 in 5 gay, bisexual men in us cities has hiv | reuters who was the yo-yo who was asking 'what harm to society does homosexuality cause'? the really sick part is that schools, etc., still push homosexual sex as a healthy lifestyle. imbeciles.
1	Kudos to Dubya! I thought that Brown was, well I don't know, INCOMPETENT!	Well, that third exclamation point really convinced me :-)BTW, the Bush administration dumped Federal Emergency Management Director Michael Brown as commander of hurricane Katrina relief operations on Friday.
0	If there is a positive relationship between drug consumption and crime, it doesn`t seem very likely that crime would go down as a result of lowering the price on drugs (and thus rasing consumption).	Too late, drug usage has already created those epidemics. Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily, but they already exist. I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain.
1	Yeah parents like these?...Westboro Baptist Church family disowns daughter ? 20/20 - YouTubeChristian Nutters is what I like to call them..	most any parent (except a bad parent) is going to love their kid no matter what and most people aren't evil gay-haters after all.
0	Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?	Perhaps another unwanted child spending a childhood is state supported homes?
1	How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.	How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe, then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence? And while your at it, ask yourself if it's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust?
1	Uhuh! And you've got a bridge in Brooklyn you want to sell me. . . .	But, but, I am a guy. And a hunky one at that.**filthy lie
1	So you evolved and the aryan race was created by God? I have never heard that before.	Not really. eugenics are not following evolution. Hitler for example didn't follow evolution at all. His entire aryan race didn't have a single fact of evolution in it.
0	oh really? hitler placed fear in those who wanted to oppose him in germany. fear is the best weapon to crush opposition.	unfortunately, learning stops when fear takes in. if the people follows you out of fear, then you are not someone who will be studied in history
1	This remark would be funny if you didn't actually mean it....	Capitalism is theft, it is entirely based on the appropriation of the labour of others by the wealthy.
1	Come now, VoR. Everyone knows that the French would never fight another country.....by themselves. emoticonXRolleyes	So let me understand..........hypothetically, England is at war with France and you are a dual citizen living in England.............So in that situation you could swear allegiance to France and support them in the war? emoticonXConfused
0	I suppose the fact that Indian law only applies to its people. Who qualifies as an Indian is another matter. Many people who have as little as one-tenth Indian blood qualify for liberal hunting privileges here in Minnesota.	What would be the legal precedent to stop non-Indians from performing or receiving abortions on sovereign lands?
0	why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom.	So gun owners are being discriminated for "who they are." I guess you could put it that way. You could also say that violent killers and serial rapists are being discriminated against for "who they are." By the way, I support gay marriage but don't support the mayor's actions.
1	Yawn.. you are so obsessed with gay sex. I am not. Enough said.	You're a LIAR, Trebor.And you're one who defends that abomination. John 8:44
1	i'm doomed. yes, i love lobster, shrimp and even the impure oyster and other mollusks, i may be innocent of wearing linen and wool together but i can't be sure!!! doomed!!! oh, dear god, i'm doomed!!!!!	depends.. do you like lobster and shrimp? do you wear linen and wool togather?
0	and how do you know?? let's see evidence of this. or, it is just one of your proclamations?? that statement says to me 'i can close my eyes to all evidence, all common sense, because i believe in god'.	in the eyes of god, what you describe as supernatural, is not.  of course it is a religion, it is all based on consensus of speculated ideas.  detractors attacked for questioning the reality of it.
1	i love it when straight, christian folk who disapprove of gays seem to know so much about what it is to be gay - how it feels, how they became that way, the nature of their relationships and whether or not its something they can control. hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to. emoticonxrolleyes	go ahead, delude yourselves. that's what you do best. emoticonxrolleyes
0	we do? how do we know that? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link, but i am unaware of proof that there is no link. did i miss something?	my biggest problem with the gay rights issue is their tireless and often deceptive efforts to drag science into the whole thing. we know that there is nothing that ties biology and genes into sexual orientation, yet the gay society insists that there is, supporting shabby studies with inconclusive results and publishing them as facts. i have absolutely no problem with the gay lifestyle, marriage rights or social place. but when it must be done under the guise of false science, there is a problem from what ive seen, homosexuality, and sexuality on a whole, is indeed a complex issue. it is misunderstood, and many 'authorities' on the subject submit conflicting reports, making the issue even more complicated. not only that, but people guard their sexuality with strong emotions, and therefore tend to believe what they want to believe about it. it makes finding the truth 10 times more difficult.
0	Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either.	This is what it has come down to. The scientific world is in sad, sad shape. It's pathetic, really.....yet all you anti-intellectuals will soak it up like a sponge.
1	A load of unowhat repeated for many years now. Junk science commissioned to get results that were desired. Check out lung cancer rates for Rastafarians. Nothing abnormally high. Gateway my arse.	I think it should be legalized for medical use only (reducing the pain, nausea, and weight loss caused by AIDS). If it can ease the pain and suffering of someone, that's fine. I see no use for it other than that. What kind of society will we live in when people can freely smoke something that is 5 times more cancerous than cigarettes, causes lung damage, and pregnancy complications. It impairs motor coordination, reaction time, and it's a mild hallucinogen; great, another thing to have to test motorists for. Drunk driving isn't even under control yet, why should there be something else to monitor. It can change the brain chemistry and makes the brain more open for such other drugs as cocaine and heroin: gateway drug. I just don't think it's a good idea.Used information from "Psychology Seventh Edition" David G. Myers
0	Because that's when the law says that they have the 'right to live.' Rights are legal terms that are fabricated by humans. They are not constant, but rather change whenever we wish to change them.	c) Why do these creatures have the right to live at the time you give for question b.
1	Well, then, I guess that in America we can't possibly be safe from kill-happy gunners can we?	Simone, you are one sick puppy. We are a safety conscious group! Once you fix the evil within the heart of man, we will then consider your point of view on the 2nd Amendment. However, if you were ever successful, then there would be no need to for your view of the 2nd Amendment. Let me speak everyone here. We wish not only Amanda Ross was not only living and safe, but perhaps had the weapon to protect herself from her assailant, if she was comfortable doing so! Hey I just had another group you could blame. Blame law enforcement because they can't be everywhere all of the time!
1	You know, I've seen this BS from you quite often. Is your life sour? Do you need to make other peoples lives as miserable as you can just so you can get through the day?	Is it a passionate belief of yours not to use capital letters.I think that was the point of the question.
1	i love it how you every time someone disagrees with you, you call it 'attacking' :|	ahh here we go again. the attacking begins, i'm all alone and nobody is backing me up. it feels like it's just me against everyone on the site on this debate.
1	Yeah, so will slaves who don't know their Biblical place under their masters, and women who don't submit to men.	Go for it. But as long as that Bible exists it will always be a sin. God is not fooled.
0	Actually, Mega didn't make any claims. He just reposted an editorial.	They both claimed that this was result of the ban on handguns.
1	And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.	And I would appreiciate your refraining from calling the Bible mythology.
0	It's thanks to the opposers of the theory that all this rubbish about descending from monkeys and slimeball came about, all ppl need is a bit more education and things should become clearer.	This is personal pet-hate...It is not true to say humans did not evolve from apes - humans are apes and we did evolve from other apes. What we didn't do is evolve from any apes still living today, but our common ancestors with those apes were themselves apes.
0	Well, I forgot to add one thing: a legal notice to the gov't about such behavior.	so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?
0	My mom can only trace her family back a few generations. By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century, the records get very confusing and very incomplete. By creationist logic, we must then accept that my ancestors, white Americans, were specially created in North America by God.	And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years. The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s.
0	Well, not completely, but yes, quite the same. However, this is irrelivent- she wasn't a person, because she was in a coma. Does that give me the right to kill her? Of course not!   What about fetuses born in comas? Can we kill them?   What about people in vegetative states? After all, they arn't perfect, so let's kill them!	do you think she was the same person she was when in a coma as she is when coherent? do you believe that if her mind was transported to another person that she would still be in her body and not in her mind?
0	Dealing with a designated nuisance species isn't the same thing as hunting. It's wildlife management.	Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?
1	However, we do give people alcohol, there are many people who drink it on a regular basis who are not addicts. What do these substances you mention have to do with being gay? Would it perhaps be okay for me to have homosexuality on the weekends or after work during happy hour?	So if a drug addict, or an alcoholic stands up and says, "God made me this way", should we accept that fact, and give them drugs or alcohol.
0	So, I guess you didn't get the memo that this country was FOUNDED on Christian/Judaic beliefs. Remember: You do have rights; to an extent.	I don't think that there are any marriage rights for anyone gaurenteed by the constitution. I believe that if marriage is offered to heteros, and they seem to think it is their right to get married, then marriage must be extended equally to gay people. I believe that one group using their religion as a basis to form laws that violate another groups religious freedom, with govenment support, violates the constitution.
0	my dear lad, your emotions are too, too chaotic. still them!	im sorry, i think may have enjoyed that a little to much!  may i have another?  this time on my bottom please, ive been a very very naughty boy!
1	Was she on her knees, taking lessons from you...or was she skilled already?	Dont forget my daughter...they had a video of naked men behind the bar too.We all thought it was funny.Some homosexuals seem quite nice...not grizzled old queens like some:)
0	But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent.	<snip of silly, irrelevant religious claptrap> Creation is not a necessity, but I have yet to see substantial evidence to disprove it.
0	If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it.	Those quotes have nothing to do with abortion. This one has to do with babys in the woumb     "Befor I formmed you in the woumb, I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet amoungst nations"   Jeremiah 1:4-5    I thin
1	Have some cheese with your whine, turkey?  Who is the liar? It is the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is an antichrist. 1 John 2:22  That would be you and those like you. Repent, you heathen!	now we have a request that another forum member die. there is nothing christian about you. you may as well stop pretending. if you are right about your god, you're going to be satan's number one hot-poker puppet.
0	Well, first, those were Hebrews, not Christians. Secondly, the scripture doesn't say they raped them, it says "keep them for yourselves." That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention. Also, the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men, so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small. However, that DOESN'T mean it was justified or right.	Also, if the Christian worldview is against rape, why does Moses say that Yahweh allows the Israelites to take the virgin children of the Midianites captive to do with what they would in Numbers 31?
0	Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis.	The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life.
1	do you actually believe that? do you have any evidence? complaining is practically the national passtime here.	if you don't like the country, feel free to leave. go over to britain or canada where they have whatever you could possibly want in terms of social policy...except for the right to question the government and complain about the quality of living.
1	what are they doing at the marshals service anyway besides losing two way radios? maybe, they should just radio it in to find them, oh wait, they can't, they are lost.	10 - 4. roger that. we lost thousands of two way radios. mission accomplished.
1	Plenty of examples,law abiding citizens are shot by criminals daily.However the O.P. is about police going off the edge.Oh did I mention that some of those law abiding citizens sometimes shoot the criminal trying to kill them?	you have no examples of civilians shooting each other ?? :p
0	Oh, I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I'm completely for it.	I believe the filibuster issue relates to voting on judgeships only. ICBM, but this won't affect abortion issues.It's only recently that the Democrats have used the filibuster to delay the vote on appointed judges.I don't think there's any possibility of getting rid of filibusters all together.BTW, what's wrong with a pro-life court? ;)
0	In 2000, the U.S. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides. The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25% higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year. In Japan, the number was 22.sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan.	How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year?
1	That may seem like a brainstorm to you kronus, but to the enlightened, it was an obvious brainfart. emoticonXGood But I would never expect you to know the difference.	Wait! I just had a brainstorm that no one in the history of history has surely never had before. What if, just what if, the OT and NT don't actually perfectly express God's will? What if they're just books written by people!Wow, how could no one have ever thought of that before! This message brought to you by the Sarcasm Council of America. Helping to drive home obvious points for over 100 years!
1	Considering what you turkeys did to the State of California, with its budget and social depravity, you have no room to talk. I'm surprised the Lord hasn't cast San Francisco and L.A. into the Pacific Ocean yet.	Ask yourselves this: If you found out Easyrider, Zorba, and Gonzo were advising several major presidential candidates... and were being taken very seriously by them... wouldn't you be just a tiny bit alarmed??Unfortunately the reality is not far off. Only worse.
1	nor do i understand how buying materialistic items or receiving them is very christian yes!!! thankyou!!! i'm glad someone finally said it! now what was one of the deadly sins of christianity? oh right, greed. hypocrisy much?	have you even read the other arguments? or even researched the topic? i don't care if you're a christian, that's cool and your belief, but give credit where credit is due. christians made the holiday a christian holiday mostly as a way to convert more people. but it's not really a christian holiday, nor do i understand how buying materialistic items or receiving them is very christian...
1	Well if no siege comes, I guess no harm no foul.	With 250 million guns owned in the U.S. today -- it's as if we're permanently awaiting a siege that will never come -- there's simply no hope of eradicating arms from the American equation.
1	I wasn't aware that a hairstyle could choose to believe (or not believe) in a god.............	Nope. It's the liberals and godless mullets who are screwing things up.
0	1) i dont recall saying anything that i believed 2) someones experiences should definitly be looked at you are just one rude person. i was just sharing an experience my mom had teaching. not only that, youe are comparing a pedophiliac to a gay man adopting. what does this prove? i never said all striaight families are perfect and i never said all gay families are bad either. all i stated was one persons direct observations on the situation. how many child of gay couples have you taught? observed? 30 years worth? i believe i will take someones experience over you being rude.	only if the question is from whence did you get your prejudices?
0	No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution.	But are the mutated fish really a different species or are they merely a race, like humans with different skin colors?
1	Said like a lazy, ignorant person who would rather live off the sweat of others than go out and earn for himself.	Said like a cruel evil person who has no concern for his fellow man.
1	So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.	Atheists are clearly capable of all of these, but if human beings are just collections of bones, blood and tissue, what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them?
1	Or, since he didn't have $37-million tucked away from questionable business practices and a rich daddy, perhaps he paid attention to the ramifications of abnormal deficit spending.	To bad they couldn't work the same magic on their next Republican President.Maybe Clinton better understood the downside of deficit spending and its effect on future generations.
1	Hehehe. Sounds like an American in a big SUV looking at $4/gallon gasoline with a maxed out credit card listening to fundamentalist talk radio.	USA number #1 in another category.But think of the influence the US gains from having foreign governments and corporations owning more of US debt. Think of the flexibility the US has in regards to budgets with a higher debt load eating more of the budget in service costs. Think of the huge new markets for US companies in Asia, to make, and sell in Asia. Think of the US's transistion to a new economy where every one works in a service sector and the strength of the US manufacturing industry (pride of the world).
1	And the scientific papers don't. The problem here is that creationists don't read the scientific papers. In fact, most can't even understand them.	Evolution is supposed to be science, and is said to not address religion.
1	Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?	That is the standard textbook answer, but it does not respond to my post. If you were to ask ronound economists of today like Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (from the book Capitalism) they would disagree with this standard textbook answer.
1	Haaa Haaa Haaa Haaa haaa haaa haaa haaa Thats a good one not. emoticonXClown	Now if I could just convince you to vote for Bush....
0	Yep - that's someting that many "pro-lifers" also never take into account.	No biggy. I am happy though that you did take more than reasonable precautions to prevent pregnancy in the 1st place.
1	is it only the spiritually blind that can see guys like this for what they really are? rip preacher.	that's it! i'm not pitching my tent in your backyard! ;)
0	And we know this how? You complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this?Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?	Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States!
0	Not at all. The theory of evolution contains many many things.	I am "curious" however, why you're now saying that you are arguing that a tautology is a tautology? It seems...misleading the way you try to broaden the tautology of one phrase, to all of evolution, as seen in your statement "evolution contains tautology".
1	And ill continue to have pity for abused and unplanned pregnant women lacking basic healthcare.	I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible "lovers" out there.
1	Man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form. Did we invent the wheel, or discover the idea? Did the Wright brothers invent machine powered flight, or was it that they stumbled upon it? In every culture, in every society, man looks to something greater than himself. They simple don't leave it at themselves and be done with it.	If we were created in God's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of God's emotions. That our emotions are imperfect versions of his.Of course I would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. And to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. An 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.
0	Why are you dishonest enough to claim that you aren't trying to get YEC into the schools.	It is not. It is baseless conjecture. In fact, it is in contrast to generally accepted biological rules (life does NOT come from nonliving matter).
1	How many suicide bombers have you herard of wearing a cross? You're assertion is absurd...as usual.	You mean there is a difference between muslim and christian extreamists? I don't see one.
1	No, I have no idea. He didn't build the Bush Library as Marc Rich did to get a pardon from Clinton, did he?	Even if they did go to jail. They would most likely get pardons. Clinton gave pardons Bush can to. JP do you know what Lay did for Bush and his Dad?
1	I'm sure the response is that He could. But, y'know, God's a real XXX sometimes... (Besides, who do you think used His uber-complex biochemical engineering skills to create the prions responsible for FFI, anyway?)	My personal answer would be that if god is truly omnipotent, he could eliminate many causes of unhappiness without causing suffering. As an example, take fatal familial insomnia. Why couldn't a god stop something like that?
0	14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol.	the minimum drinking age should be lowered to 14 if not 12. the main problem with alcohol is drinking habits, non-safe drinking habits are encouraged by a high age of license due to how alcohol is more likely to be consumed in bulk and away from proper supervision for those underage. laws prohibiting underage drinking fail to do such, and actually end up causing some of the situations they are meant to avoid. rather then alcohol being another part of life, used in moderation around family and good friends well supporting the economy by actualizing more of the demand for it. it is given the allure of the forbidden fruit, consumed as fully as possible whenever possible because its seen as a rare item to behold, and often consumed around shady suppliers or swigged from stolen bottles.
0	In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole "let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it" mentality....	"Modern" Atheists have only been around for a short time. In biblical times, Atheists were people who beleved in God(s), but didn't believe He/they intervened with life on Earth. How and why do you think the terms have changed, and what are the similarities between tham?

1	I'd be curious if Berkowitz studied whether a sword or club produced the same effect as a firearm?   Short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty, I'm afraid boys will be boys.	"Researchers from Knox College find that male college students who held a gun rather than a child's toy for 15 minutes had elevated levels of testosterone and added three times as much hot sauce to a glass of water that another test subject subsequently had to drink."Richard Morin - Perfect 10s and the Odds of a Pink Nursery - washingtonpost.com" 'The finger pulls the trigger,' says Leonard Berkowitz, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin. 'But the trigger may also pull the finger. It's not just that having a gun is a convenient way of settling an argument. The weapon itself is a stimulant to violence.'"Berkowitz has studied the 'weapons effect' for more than 40 years. 'There's no dispute,' he says. 'Even the sight of guns, which people think of as objects that can hurt others, can induce aggressive ideas. A weapon can function as a conditioned stimulus, eliciting both the thoughts and motor responses associated with its use.' "WHY GUNS SHARE THE BLAME - TIME
1	1868 actually, that is a link to the wikipedia article on the act. once again, the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 are not the same thing. more importantly, a store saying 'no blacks allowed' is not violating the 14th, they violate the civil rights act of 1964. furthermore, a store saying 'no guns allowed' is not violated the 2nd amendment.  time for you to read up on the constitution doc, you might find some good things in there. i'm a little surprised you don't vote democrat given your thoughts. then again, not much difference between a given democrat and your texas 'republicans' (see w bush and rick perry)	let's just cut to the chase on your spurious claim. when was the xivth amendment passed.? here is the enforcement provisions of the act of 1964: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_rights_act_of_1964 heller ruled that the 2a was about more than 'discrimination on gun laws' in that as long as the 'discrimination was equal it would be legal according to the plaintiffs and muncipalities'. that was ruled out and dismissed by scotus. you are building a strawman trying to imply i said your words. you are a poor liar. ad absurdum!
0	This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.	We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights.
1	Examined the record? Now it's not even the patient, just the record? Good god man! Many times, only a number of criteria must be met, not all of them. It would be like me saying that there must be gas in your car since it is running. Then you tell me that I must look at the gauge then physically take the tank off to be able to say without a doubt there is gas in it. Flat EEG in the cerebral cortex means no brain activity in cerebral cortex means PVS. There is no reason to test a swallowing reflex, a pain response reflex, or sphincter tone.	I think he examined her record and the information by which some other doctor pronounced her PVS, noting that one or more criteria for establishment of that diagnosis was missing. I'm not arguing the case for him, I'm just saying she should be fed until this is proved wrong. The doctor is supposed to be quite an eminent member of his filed of study and may actually know what he is talking about.

0	Yes, the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite. The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe, the Roman, of course, being the largest. The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite, and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.East to West, a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church, especially those of the east.Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?	I think you'll find that Byzantine (http://www.byzcath.org/), or Greek Catholic, are Catholic. Like the Maronite Church they practice Eastern Rites as Orthodox do, but they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.* They even say the original "Nicene Creed" as we do.

0	Because of the history of it. Well, ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state'. Let's just say that I.D. is an attempt to teach Creationism in school.	Incidentally, is the title of this forum meant to imply that creationism and Intelligent Design are two names for the same thing? While I agree that they are more similar to each other than to evolution, it troubles me that anyone would believe that they are synonymous. For those that think the title is justified, what about the two beliefs do you find similar enough to class them as the same idea?

0	Oh no, I completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is. Your continuing to compare the ID concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more.

0	Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: "a revolution". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!	:It probably would have been better if Scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court, "There certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment and I, as an amateur historian, am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others. I will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities." Nice interpretation by Dennis Henigan of HCI. He would have loved that but pretending it hasn't been ruled as an individual right by the 82nd Congress, the DOJ in August 2004 with all the history and also by 35 Supreme Court rulings and TWO CENTURIES of lower court cases that fills a 660 pg. book with majority opinion, he is either deaf/blind or outright deceitful...I opt for the latter.He and they know full well that all the courts now are bound to consider any Second Amendment case as a civil rights issue thanks to this ruling."letting people decide" has already been done, once when the Constitution was ratified with the BOR and again when the XIVth Amendment was passed. He may as well say race issues will be decided by elected representatives the racial balance necessary in their own communities"He is completely dishonest and knows full well that this is a Republic based on the Law of the Land, The Constitution and not a democracy as he suggests. One may as well follow the Piper over the cliff like a herd of lemmings to not recognize this time worn tune played by the gun grabbers.

The lagomorph doesn't realise it is so 40s to talk about genes "controlling" cells. Modern biology knows that cells are governed by an interaction of genes and environment. Of course, lagomorph is careful not to read about any of this, so nothing can disturb the anti-Darwinian fantasy world he inhabits.

0	I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though.	Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime. The reason for having a gun is as you stated - to stop the crime once it has begun (though this may prevent a worse crime from occurring).
0	i would never limit myself in a debate to 'how many' generations it takes because the fact is your scientists are afraid to test such things. in the following example it took between 7 and 18 generations for guppies to change their phenotypes. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...sss-270397.php of course these guys, being evolutionsts explain this phenomenon as happening through natural selection -- death. but what have we already learned about tadpoles?? -- they develop in direct relation to their predators....including body structure. fish are no different.	tsk tsk. on the iidb board, you insisted that if an animal was transplanted to a different environment, you would expect it's phenotype to change in response to that environment within 'a few' generations. a few is generally taken to be around three (much less than 12 anyways. that is what we call 'a dozen'). oh, and strawman, again, does not mean what you think it means. please answer my question.

0	Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view.	Science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out. The best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all.

0	Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.	The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:"It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union "to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS."The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state. But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia.
1	look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice.	is it now? is it backed up by the stats? what's your evidence aside from 'it sounds right to me'? but the same applies to most countries - particularly in the west. [url='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_related_attacks'] and yet us school killings account for more deaths in this list than the rest of the world put together (counting like-for-like situations, not rebel military actions such as in vietnam, pakistan or russia).
1	oh yes. that's why the brits took fast and sure measures to round up the islamofascist jerks. wish we could do the same here, oh yes, i almost forgot.we are!!	doesn't really change the fact that you were either entirely ignorant of casualties figures, or flat out lied. we got attacked because of our involvement in iraq by the way. those attacks wouldnt have occurred has it not been for the iraq war. that said terrorism isn't new at all here. the ira have been failing at it for decades, some crazy extremists aren't going to do much better. -wez

I would appreciate it if some of you experts could give me some simple answers to a couple simple questions and help me with some of my doubts.
1	So then will you go the way on liberty (repeal stoopid laws) or tyranny (enact more unconstitutional laws)?

The attention seeking makes little sense as I rarely discuss my personal religious experiences because they are just that, personal, and because my telling people something will not be convincing to them, and hence serves no purpose. If you want to trivialise mental illness in order to belittle others then that's entirely your lookout. If you want I could reciprocate by pointing out how obsessive-compulsive your rants are.
1	so now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?  i expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? am i to believe that you are a soldier there now?  your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. i posted exactly what i meant to and you went off on a tangent. i asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if 'show me yours before i show mine?' pitiful.	proof. give me proof that 'these animals' are the same citizens of iraq which we are attacking, occupying their homeland and adding an extra layer of tyrrany to an already terrorized, fearful country?  give me proof that shoving our fear and anger at innocent civilians is anything close to what is right or just.  we replace saddam hussain with george bush and the only real difference is that gb has never once set foot inside their country.  so don't give me that line that aborted fetuses are innocent in comparission. if you claim that a fetus is a life, what does it matter what type of life it is? human life is still human life.
1	All the more reason to be armed to the teeth huh,does this mean you see it our way?	The Mumbai massacre was an attack by Pakistani terrorists. If a country can't keep terrorists armed with machine guns and bombs from crossing its borders then you can't expect gun control to help in such situations. There might be even more such attacks in the US if the US shared a border with Pakistan.
1	So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.	I have already asked God for forgiveness and he has forgiven me.
1	Indeed true. God created man in his own likeness and man returned the favor. Man created a vindictive, vengeful, and vicious god, according to the Bible. So where does a loving god come from?	Easily understood when man created his own god.
0	which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation.	so says the offspring of islam.....still wrong but vehement in his certitude. sheer bluster and effrontery does nothing to counter jo's calm and factual comments.
0	Actually in high school I had a friend who used to be in placement. He was sixteen years old an he said he got the s*** beat out of him by an eight year old boy. "Street kids" get their XXX beat every day, pain is nothing new to them. It seems they're immune to it. It doesn't matter how hard you can hit, if you can't take a punch, then you can't call yourself street-worthy.	If only she'd been allowed to have a gun she could have what? Shot or threatened to shoot someone? "Boys and girls as young as 10", the story says.They threw "rocks and eggs" at her house.They don't kill you for that in England, Texas maybe.
1	My thoughts are my own, not from some 2000 year old Book that makes as much sense as a bag of Rocks. And I have only ever called anyone a name in response to an attack on me,   If you call what you have been doing debating then I see what the problem really is.	I don't now, nor have I ever run away from debates here or anywhere else. The fact is that none of you have an original thought between you so I'm not here to banter back and forth anymore, but to give my opinions and move on to another subject. The reality is that opinions are all we have here so arguing minutia back and forth is a waste of time and bandwidth. I really don't feel the need to respond to the names you mooks end up calling me since I know my place in eternity, so have at it for all I care. It makes no difference to me at all. emoticonXAgree
0	Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?   I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.	one extreme example!?!?!? this is the vpc they claim to be for 'moderate gun control laws' they used to be hci. this is one of the largest anti-civil rights groups operating in the us

0	dear terry here, please see my post on the other side of this debate. you may think that nothing happens after you argue a debate, but that is just the start. so much more happens after a debate is created and argued. people around the world look at the debates and learn from them, make decisions because of them and create additional debates. your input can change the world. andy	but after we debate , nothing happens right? so debate for..?

1	You mean your hypothetical I presume? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal.   You're a bit slow I see.	oh brother.. so what if a minority of americans wanted to legalize murder.this is rediculous.

0	**True, and the confusion was my bad, as explained already. However, the fact of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, as demonstrated by Ames and by Cairns, still shoots great big holes in the darwinist assumptions arising out of your old war-horses, Luria & Delbruck '43, and its "clone", Lederberg and Lederberg '52.	However, all of that is quite beside the point in the case under discussion.

0	Do you? Care about gay people, that is. You keep imply that it's only their tactics you don't like, but I can't recall you ever saying that you support a persons right to be gay. So please, cards on the table. Do you support a person's right to have sex with whatever willing adult they choose? No politics, no tactics. Please, just answer that simple question.	Matthew has shown that he has an extremely black and white view of the world. He doesn't understand that people can disagree with gay peoples' behavior and still care about gay people.
1	ok, fine, you can use that line, but there is also a moajority that believes in other things. there's this crazy thing, called a choice. we all have that. remember? i made the choice to have sex, you're making the choice to be a total ***hole. we all make a decision, and its the strong ones that stick with them, even though there are others who dont believe the same thing.	Yet mine is right....well it isn't really mine, it is the majorities.

0	The whole "change the definition of marriage" is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots. They don't seem to realize that words can have several meanings.	Those who object to same-sex marriage primarily (or so they claim) because it would "change the definition of marriage" should perhaps be made aware that that train has already left the station:Merriam-Webster On-line http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/marriage Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage Encarta http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/featur...fid=1861628509 American Heritage http://www.bartleby.com/61/2/M0120200.html This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects. (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)
1	let's look up all the definitions, shall we? here's where you got 'yours': as you can see, the definition you cited is only used once, and even then it is just one of two from that source.  i notice you ignored all of the responses to you on the thread and decide to just post this piece of work without answering people. we are waiting, oh sentient one. we have shown you creatures that match all of these definitions (or at least all of the definitions that are seen in each and every source - see how alike each one is?) - now show us how humans are the only sentient beings in the universe.	sentient: endowed with feeling and unstructured consciousness  what creature do you know of that has feelings and an unstructured consciousness? or are you dr. dolittle? now go sit on your rock....maybe it'll hatch. :)
1	good grief... satanist?!.. my goodness how can you say such a thing?!  i will have to ban you for even mentioning the concept of it! my dear old fellow!	why is the world no all atheist? why is the world not all theist? why is the world not all satanist, christian, good, bad, black, white? simply put, people have their differences. if there was but one person type on the planet, not much would get done.

0	From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo...w/26satel.htmlHmmm, Teddy Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, the Rockefeller foundations, millions of Americans, the State of Indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS.Interesting, yes?	In 1927, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared it "better for all the world" if the "manifestly unfit" could be stopped from reproducing. "Three generations of imbeciles are enough," he famously wrote in his ruling in Buck v. Bell, which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior. . . . in the mid-1800's . . . the British polymath Sir Francis Galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it, which he named eugenics. In America, Galton's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport, who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning. . . . Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the "germ-plasm" of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated. Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy, which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act, which kept out "inferior" people from Southern and Eastern Europe. Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives, which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit: Galton suffered from severe depression; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy. In America and elsewhere, enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites. In Britain, people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals, and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals. Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists, who saw it as further justification for abolishing class — after all, once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied. In this country, eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations. It galvanized temperance advocates, suffragists, and liberal American churches and synagogues. Citizens enthusiastically entered "Fitter Family" and "Better Baby" contests.
0	You say you cannot see it from the gay perspective, then you speak from that perspective as a gay man. This is confusing. As a heterosexual, if you are one, would you give up those rights and let gays have the rights?	Apparently, you have five questions.If by 'ability for inward perspective' you imply the ability to look at one's self, it is incongruent to say you are leary of our ability 'to think of life from a gay perspective'. What you are asking is for people to see your troubles from your perspective...hardly possible for many.Yes. Were I a logical gay man, I would accept the fact that I cannot marry a man due to the definition of marriage. I would accept that fact and continue to demand that all legally joined couples share the same benefits now given to married couples.
0	You bring up a very interesting point.   All those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well. When polled, residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions.   So, not only are the anti's disingenuous as far as what they promoted, but were so in HOW these amendments were promoted.	The Civil Union argument is a disingenuous one.Those people who are fighting against the rights of gays to marry do not want to see same-sex couples receive any rights or recognitions of their relationships. The authors of all those constitutional amendments ensured that there were no recognition of any other types of relationships in their wording.Why should any of us settle for something that these very same people are going to attempt to deny anyway?
1	It is only difficult to sort out if you are a neocon and fail to recognize that neocons are nothing but militant liberals.   Bush was BY FAR the most liberal president we have had for at least 20 years.   Maybe you need to research traditional conservative values.	Not at all, it's just that other posters that often agree with you in just about every way want to call themselves conservatives (they've called Clinton a conservative, Bush a liberal, etc.) so it does get difficult to sort it all out sometimes.
0	This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.	Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage?

0	Actually you are incorrect. The most commonly used rifles on the competition circuit are so-called "assault weapons".The "assault weapon" moniker is a term just recently fashioned to describe a military looking weapon.There are several target competitions designed solely for these types of rifles.	I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed. an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human. this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.
1	I take your point.But bloody hell, I couldn't handle a baby at the moment! Does that mean I'm psychologically unready?...probably, but oh well...	14 year olds are psychologically unready for sex. Would you say you could handle a baby at this point? That’s a good gauge.

0	Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality. My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say "Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this..."But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?	Um. Have you read Leveticus? And I mean, read it. Not skimmed it.Because, God loves everybody. Are you reaching?
1	I think you need to breathe in a bag for a while..then maybe have a nap.	Heck, no. You've convinced me. I say let them have sex! Let them have sex with whomever they want. Your imaginary friends who want to have sex with their relatives can and should go do it. I support the right of imaginary people to have sex with whomever they want and to marry whomever they want! Power to the imaginary people! Give them liberty or give them imaginary death!

0	Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by "friction".By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation.	This is not evolution. It is not a mutation. This is adaptaion.

1	Odd. I can't seem to find any racial slurs or racist ideology in those sentences. In fact, I don't see any race or races in general even mentioned. You're just one of those people who thinks you can win a discussion by accusing your opponents of being racist. Sorry simone, but in the real world, people can disagree with your leftist views (which are barely existent) without being racist.	1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity, by legislating the wealth out of prosperity.2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.3, The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work, because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is the beginning of the end of any nation.
0	reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary 'defense' nuclear weapon parity with russia. considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq, i'm surprised our conceit hasn't made all of me and asia scramble for nukes. pakistan, 97% muslim, hides bin laden, governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts, never a bad word about that us 'ally'. but they have nukes and delivery systems. i'd think iran believes, as we've shown, that the us doesn't spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons.	this is what i don't understand. on the one hand we have iranians going on about death to america. on the other our own president is constantly making statements about spreading democracy and toppling current regimes in the me. is one any worse than the other?  i still contend that mad solves most of the problems with nuclear proliferation. sure, some of the iranians are crazy (as are some american leaders), but they are not stupid. they are not going to use nukes as offensive weapons if it is going to ensure their own destruction in retaliation.
1	'some people just need killin'' - that sounds just fantastic!	some people just need killin'. really, it's as simple as that. life in prison? hah, what's to stop them from killing other inmates? maybe some poor bastard who stole some cash from a 7/11 to get food for his family got thrown in the slammer and suddenly he's got leatherface up his ass with a chiv? i dunno, maybe i care about the general population but murderers need to die. plain and simple.

0	Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out.       Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?	I know of no one that is pro life believes the mother should die so the baby can live.
0	I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people.	Government is violence.

Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive? Sounds kinda fascist to me.	Why don't we just ASK women who've had abotions...that's all the proof you need! I have been reading stories of women who in their own words talked about their abortion experiences....even the ones who claim to be pro choice and still are after the abortion make statements of lingering feeling guilt and regret over having it done as well as nightmares about it. If it's really no big deal, then why would they feel that way?
1	I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above.	Ok, let's give that a try.Evolution doesn't require something to have evolved from nothing, so this isn't a valid criticism. Evolutionary theory seeks to explain the plain fact of common descent.

0	You contradict yourself. If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis.	3a) If you do the math, severe earthquakes (caused by God) could have very easily covered the Earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points. Also, with these severe earthquakes, not all of the Earth would have to be covered equally at one time. There could have been some parts shallow enough to actually see the ground below.3b) Who said the Earth started out as a flat super continent? I believe that God made the Earth only a few thousand years ago, not that much geographically different from the way it is now.
0	NOt true,California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal.	Well, of course the issue isn't "limiting" marriage, but rather making it more open-ended. But again, either way, it'll be a moot point before too long.
1	so a vote for an adulterous divorcee is a vote for morality? is this election being held in wonderland? i'm pretty sure mccain falls foul on bearing false witness as well.	don't buy into this leftist propaganda icare, god is neither a republican nor an american so ones political party has no bearing on our salvation. what we do know though is that god honors truth and morality and obama represents none of that. a vote for mccain is a vote for democracy. a vote for obama is a vote for socialism.
0	So if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence, and a devout Christian believes God is the highest form of intelligence, the Christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence?	They are different terms and apply to different things. Secularism is not a worldview in itself, it is a policy of how to apply religious and other worldview in real life.Secularism does not exclude people with a religious worldview. One may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith, but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith, and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people (usually with the subclause of "Let them burn in hell afterwards", or something else along those lines).

Please excuse me for having misplaced priorities.	all what simone does is stir things up. i am sorry that those little girls died but to paint all men with the same brush is sexism in reverse. some men do not like women, but some women seem to hate men, for reasons unknown to me
1	Look who's talking.   Besides, it's a free country. It's not "Politically Correct Treborville" that we're playing here.	That is between them and God. They have not done so, and I suspect that their interpretation of 'The great commissoin' is much different than yours.You, after all, reject anybody who doesn't believe the way you do.
1	Oh come on! Instead of turning my sarcasm on it's head why don;t you log off and go listen to some more Chuck Smith tapes? I'm sure the Calvary Chapel brigade could use another "donation."	Sexual inuendo: yet another symptom of your sexual perversion as you interpret even spiritual analogies to sex.
0	Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you "view humanity with mental existance as important" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood.	Many of us view humanity with mental existence as important. The only ones you are protecting that our view does not are those human living entities with no mental existence. How can you even talk about "harm" to a living entity with no mental existence?
1	Tell me, how does one "steal land" from a nomad? emoticonXConfused	This is not a Christian country; the Europeans stole this land from Native Americans. But it's fair to say you just insulted a number of people of faith, who donot follow Christianity, only.
0	The problem here is that Christians (such as I am) consider the Bible to be Proof.	you can not prove life begans at conception, and the burden of proof for taking away one's rights relys on proof.
1	If you had a look at all of the other threads on this topic you would see that.	You were rather ambiguous on that point earlier. Just out of curiosity, what do you mean by “we?”
0	You can do whatever you want to do with your money. The fact that you don't know any better than to do that with your money is telling, though. If you think that the C(R)SC actually does ID-based scientific research, you're exactly the dupe they're looking for.I'm serious. Do the research for yourself. I won't even give you links, because you'll XXXX them off as propaganda. Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID. I dare you.	Is this another personal attack? Or is it killing you that i would donate money to an organization that opposes your secular humanist agenda so you feel you must lash out like an angry child? Is that your issue lyteboy?
1	So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves.	Because it is illegal to own a handgun without a difficult-to-get permit in New York,
0	take another look. we certainly do have our hands firmly on the levers of power. sixty us senators, a substantial majority in the house, a president who represents the death of reaganism once and for all. a solidly pro-choice president and congress. a president and a congress who understand that each of us is responsible for all the rest of us. oh yes, this country will emerge from the bush depression and the optional bush wars with a new sense of direction and a new prosperity. by the next election, there will be so few congressional republicans that they can caucus in the mens' room - provided, of course, that larry craig has not returned for a visit and is using it for other purposes. the naysayers can either get on the train or get left at the station.emoticonxsmilie	sorry, 'you' don't control anything. you're nothing but a sad dupe for the people that have bought and paid for the white house. it's almost pathetic, but at this point, i feel you deserve it. have fun as your social security loses half its value over the next 10 years.
0	I'm not trying to participate in gang debate, but well..The population of "people with heart trouble" would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce. If reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off.	Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.
1	So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about.	Second, in this very thread Arch has deliberately tied the two as one. There are at least three posts here where he has just done that. You'll notice right off the bat, despite a distinct clarification of YEC, and NOT Christanity as a whole, that Arch deliberately takes the discussion on YEC as a discussion on Christanity. Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch. The rest of us deliberately stated otherwise.
0	oh yes, president obama also has to figure out how to get rid of the bush policy of lies and falseness bush people burrowed into the federal government by bush during his last days as president in order to thwart the spread of science, research and reality.	but of course, if it happens after president obama has his people installed, people who believe in science and research and reality, and these reality-oriented people have taken full control of the agencies who oversee these sorts of things and have made sure that regular inspections are made for food safety. i think you'd better at least allow the man six months to get his people and policies in place.
0	Schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.	SCHUMER: OK. Now, let me ask you this. When you wrote that statement, you did not -- as we discussed yesterday -- when you wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, you had no exceptions. So that would mean, at least in 1985, your view then, there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children, right?ALITO: Senator, it was a general statement that didn't go into -- it didn't...SCHUMER: But it had no exceptions. You didn't make that...ALITO: It was one sentence, and it certainly didn't represent...SCHUMER: There was no -- you didn't write any exception for that situation. Correct? It just said the Constitution does not protect. It was without exception. And, yesterday, you didn't argue me when I mentioned that without exception.ALITO: I don't recall your using the words without exception. SCHUMER: I think I did.(CROSSTALK)SCHUMER: If you believe...ALITO: Could I just answer that question? It's one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject.SCHUMER: No, I understand that. But it was a very strong statement. It didn't talk about any exceptions at all. And the way I read that statement, even if a woman was raped by her father, she'd have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy. If you believe the Constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow, wouldn't it?ALITO: I think the statement speaks for itself, and it's one sentence and it's not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of...SCHUMER: Knowing these examples, do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad, unqualified statement, without exception, that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion? No ands, ifs or buts, is my words.ALITO: What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburg case...SCHUMER: But you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views.ALITO: That's correct. But what I was talking about there was the Thornburg case and nothing more than the Thornburg case.SCHUMER: I understand. But you haven't rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause?ALITO: Well, what you have pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up, and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through.SCHUMER: You didn't think that through in 1985?ALITO: I was not involved in...SCHUMER: When you wrote the statement. When you wrote that statement.ALITO: And when I wrote the statement what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburg case, which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of, which did not argue that Roe should be overruled, did not argue that the government should argue that Roe should be overruled, but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar.SCHUMER: I understand what you wrote, but you also -- we can bring the statement up here, but I don't want to go over the thing of yesterday. I would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement, even from 1985, that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortions. Not an exception of health of the mother, not an exception of rape or incest, not an exception of any of these others. I didn't see any of those in your job application. But I want to conclude on...ALITO: Senator...SCHUMER: Go ahead, please.ALITO: It was one sentence. And I think what you're saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account.SCHUMER: In all due respect, sir, I think it highlights the importance of an obligation to discuss it, particularly in light of a strong statement before.But we'll have to differ on that.
0	But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.	And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle.
1	i must be blessed to be surrounded by so many posters with a direct line to god so that they know who is saved or in hell. with christians as well-informed as this, i'm surprised god doesn't just retire and let them take over. after all, 6,000 years since creation must be enough for anyone.	that is not for us to say. gods grace extends to everyone, no matter what we have done.
1	You mean you've spent your good, hard-earned money on his revisionist follies? ROTFLOL!! You could have had a six pack to really make your day.	I mean (retired) Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong, whom you frequently attempt to attack but whose books (by your own admission) you've never read.
0	Actually, according to your use of the word "person," she is. A significant percentage of fertilized eggs fail to implant and are instead passed. How sad (and typical) that you haven't bothered to educate yourself about these things.	What is not fertilized is what a woman flushes in each monthly cycle. She isn't flushing people or potential people, and how sad it is that you can't understand that.
1	So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women?	I heard just shortly after the official passage that the nutters at the ACLU were already poised to argue that the State Supreme Court reverse the decision for the exact opposite reason they argued to block Pro 22, geeez talk about get your arguments straight. It will get dismissed as frivolous just like last time... these big babies are suffering from "shallow hal" disorder... they somehow believe of the majority votes in their favor - then it is a mandate, but the minute it isn't in their favor... [well] they fall into a grand mal seizure. There must not be something "fair" in it as far as they are concerned - Fair has nothing to do with it, our laws don't exist for fairness sake... they exist for clarity.Let's not forget the most important over arching reality here... this is something that isn't even supposed to be up for discussion for legislative agenda. We have no business even talking this nonsense... gays are not some "class" that need to be protected. They are citizens engaging in a behavior that falls wildly short of the overall purview of not only the electorate as the existing status quo [regardless of political affiliation] but is nothing short of a deviant sexual proclivity, that... and our laws don't' exist to morally equivocate deviancy with that of the morally clear. It is a simple matter of constants vs. variables... our laws protect what you are [the constant] not who you become [the variable], what then do we say? do we create laws and burden our courts with personal subjectivity... or do we look to the objective as we have, and should continue to do so. These radical homosexual activists are literally insane to think people are simply going to let them walk all over the natural order of things in favor of a bio[illogical] behavior? The US Constitution does not guarantee the equality of feelings, nor does it behavior. People have to start clearing the closet... so to speak, and simply be down to earth and accept that not all your decisions are going to be popular ones, and homosexuality is one of them - and you certainly don't win fans by thinking you can leverage the guilt game on people even thinking you can draw comparisons between color [innate] and sexual preference [choice] as a basis for some perceived civil right, it is just plain and utter nonsense.
0	And if you rewind a little over 40 years, the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage.Archie's reply is a non-argument, and false at that.Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage, but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage.Little things like child rape, lack of consent, and other issues.	The reason that's the case is because there are many limitations on marriage but only homosexuals claim they are being discriminated against.
1	who knew? I wonder if I could have passed all those philosophy tests based on the philosophy I absorbed?	To develop or teach one would take many years of effort. To have one you only need to absorb it from the general culture.

1	who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation? how od you know they are right? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation?  perhaps, as the roman elite at the time claimed, the bible was compiled, and christianity was heavily pushed, primarily as a method of controlling the people. we know the bible was heavily edited. we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured, and not by the folks claimed. isn't literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea?	that's where standard rules of interpretation come in. yes there is poetry and symbolism, but there are also places for literal interpretation. without the regenerate heart by means of the born-again experience, one cannot properly discern the bible.

0	I looked it up and apparently there is a synthetic form of THC on the market, (generically known as Dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol). But it is only allowed under restricted prescription (it's a Schedule II controlled substance, the same as morphine or cocaine) and is far less effective than plant-derived THC.	Aren't there already drugs in existence that contain the chemicals that are (supposedly) beneficial in marijuana (i.e. THC)?
1	Exactly, because it's not just an issue of 'her body'. What she does (the smoker) affects other people. Thanks for missing the point.	People are not allowed to smoke in most restaurants now. :)
0	Humans are about the furthest thing from perfect. The bible IS perfect, it's flawless. You can't take anything from it and prove it to be incorrect. The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences. I know plenty of people who don't believe in any sort of God and aren't bothered by the thought that this is all they have, the only life they'll ever live. Maybe some people need to believe in more to live more, but all people don't.	"God' is a figure that humanity created so that life would not be dull adn so that we would have reasurance(sp) that there is an after life
1	Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be.   These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone.	Tell me about it. They had Kerry winning FL by 2 or 3%, they had Kerry winning PA by double digits, and they had it close in VA and SC. Needless to say, Bush won FL by 7% (9% different than the exit polls), Kerry won PA by 2% (at least 8% different than the exit polls), and Bush won VA and SC by 10% and 17% respectively.I was reading a good article by Dick Morris about the apparent bias in the exit polls. He actually called Kerry to win it easy after looking at the exit polls. Turns out, they were terrible. He said that exit polls are nearly always right or very, very close. There is no possible way they could "accidentally" be so off the end result.

[quote=zachvac]i'm just saying that i'm using the exact same reasoning as you yet you reject my sleep requirement and accept a drug test. bull sleep and drugs are completley different. what you fail to provide when saying this is how sleep can be just as violent as drugs.

0	You are missing the entire point (again). Why do you feel ashamed? Because you know that what you did is bad. I have heard from a great Australian war hero, one of our remaining ANZACs soliders (recently passed away I think) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun (WWI era) and he saw him die that it was "the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure". He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life. He knows that he did something wrong, but it was a war, and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen. You are way off the plot. But let us continue.	Because your mommy and daddy told you "no, no, no" when you did something wrong.
0	Your wrong. Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres.	Notice how the places where guns are banned have the most massacres. Those who instituted laws preventing people on campus from defending themselves should be held partially liable for these crimes.

0	Just to contribute, I'm pro-gun, have had training in the proper use and laws in my area, and have owned weapons for more than 30 years.	While I am not a huge fan of polls, one of the positions often held by those of us on the pro gun side of the debate is that those in favor of stricter firearms law, are not familiar with firearms or current firearms law.I would be interested to know what level of knowledge is possessed by both sides of the argument. Please be honest. Justin
0	Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.	I am aware of that. I am just having trouble reconciling the idea of removing a fundamental right based on a misdemeanor conviction and was wondering if there is similar precedent elsewhere.
0	If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?	I'm against abortion but pro-choice. Whether the fetus is human is not something that I think is really relevant to the matter, and in any case where we give it the benefit of the doubt it is still permissable to carry out abortions in order to safeguard a woman's autonomy.
1	You see, that's the problem: "generally". You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country.	It's hard for me to believe that people in your movement don't know that generally, people's view on a political/ideological issue is a different matter than whether or not they would save their life or help them. Surely you all aren't THAT out of touch with the way people are.
1	Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.	lmao! did you read my last sentence, the conclusion of my post? and i quote: "so to answer your question: yes" damn im so evasive! since you asked the question again, ill answer again <snip>stuff about us being in a democratic system</snip> as a christian, if a legal matter is being contested, and you want to oppose it, you are certainly welcome to do so. as a gay, if you want to propose a legal matter, a christian should be equally welcome to contest it. it is doing unto others as they would have others do unto them, so to answer your question: yes
0	i think that would probably create more problems than it would solve. how would we know? we don't punish. drunk drivers get off incredibly easy so much of the time. we have the weakest anti-drunk driving laws in the western world and we have the worst problem with drunk driving. coincidence? that's not all that far from what i've said. @joe- this is for a whole other discussion, but i think that the first step in aa is a big part of the reason of its low success rate. that's not too far from what i've said either.	just privatise the road system and let the owners set the rules for drunkeness, it's the only fair way to do it.

1	Yippie doo! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view. And his point of view has (or had) merit. But since then, several feathered dinosaurs (not birds) have been found. It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation. (You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a "point mutation" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation.	Well, here's another quote from Allan Feduucia:"Feathers are unique to birds, and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified." (J. Alan Feduccia, The Age of Birds, Harvard University Press, 1980, pg. 52)
0	And those pillars will be replaced by something stronger like equality and Justice.	Marriage is between a man and a woman. If we allow marriage to be redefined to include same-sex couples, the Twin Pilllars of Morality and Spirituality (which have served as beacons of the American culture since our beginning) will not stand.
0	humans don't just have sex for procreation. humans have sex for pleasure. that explains the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerves underneath the head of the penis.	you cannot mandate biology. the fact of the matter is, however, that homosexual relationships, themselves, appear to have no positive evolutionary purpose. without effects on the female line, this aberration (for lack of a better word) would have bred itself out of the population long ago. it would be similar to a subset of the population in an animal species suddenly being attracted to another, separate animal species. it would seem to serve no positive purpose. procreation is a positive, useful purpose to any activity in an evolutionary context. sexual attraction exists to facilitate procreation. pleasure during sex exists to facilitate procreation. homosexual individuals have brains that co-opt specific biological functions to substitute creatures that do not facilitate the purpose they evolved to involve.
1	hey, archangel, i notice you didn't respond to the points i made - no argument, huh? to quote jyoshu: 'well since you didn't address my points, i'll assume you're done! a simple 'ok, i concede that ... and moving on back to the issues ...' ***jyoshu well, everyone, looks like our ez/ss clone has finally realized his argument was wrong.	you can insist your right all you like sp, and insult me all you like. that does nothing to strengthen your ridiculous insistence that angels have free will. plain and simple, you have no idea what your talking about regarding the bible or spiritual topics so i'm wasting my time trying to reason with the likes of you in any case. so wallow in your blind ignorance and be happy in it. i'm through with you.emoticonxgood
1	So AIDS is the fault of "the gays"?emoticonXRolleyes   lol it's been a long time, JP.	Revisionist history by gays is still revisionist history.

0	No it's not. Perhaps because you don't understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with ID. ID is not science and has no evidence to support it.	I don't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID.
0	YES! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed. With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild (as england did). They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote. Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system.	I wonder, how do all the other democracies manage to survive without the protection of a heavily armed citizenry? Does this mean that the found fathers of America realised that they were not to be trusted?
0	you seem to be lost in our jokes, you have to tell people you're joking so they know. and you got the punctuation wrong, in the russian phrase. the only way for it not to sound insane in russian, would be to put it as: '___ _ __. __'. calling someone '__', means things are serious, and you're ready for a fight. if you claim it to be a joke, you're just insane. so i assume that you got the punctuation wrong, and it was your signature.	i didn't say it was making me hungry. i asked if i said that, would that sound gay... again, it was a joke..... uhg....  __ _ __ __.
0	I know of at least 3 personally, including my brother. He fought for custody for years and it nearly bankrupted him. He was trying to get his kids away from an ex-wife that would go away with her boyfriend for weekends at a time and leave their 15 year old daughter in charge of threee younger siblings.	How many men who are single fathers and take sole responiblity for thier children because the women refuses to do so will you find if you go looking? A few yes, but how many more women will you find in the reverse prediciment?

A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong, so you must mean rape is good? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong, so you must mean sexual immorality is good?	Oh well. At least from my studying it seems that the Christian worldview is not correct in any way, shape or form. But still, if anyone wants to convince me, please do.
1	You can start your own thread on how historical the Gospel accounts, etc., are.   How about dealing with the question now instead of running scared and going down another rabbit trail?	Why, why don't you tell us. Speculating is not enough. Back it up with independant evidence. Also, show that the "New Testament believers" suffered persecution and even death from any source that does not come through the Christian authorities.

1	Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, "....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically." you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence.	Somewhat so. If grammatically meant "with proper grammar", then there would be no need to say "grammatically correct". I have also heard the term "grammatically flawed" or "grammatically incorrect" both of which would not comply with the definition presented.Grammatical (adj) means "of or relating to grammar".Grammatically (adv) has a similar meaning. Neither is meant to definitely imply correctness.Michael Moore is still a piece of feces. emoticonXHoho emoticonXKill all terrorists and those who support them

If you were, you would bother to have payed attention to the countless times you have been told that your abrasive, insulting tactics DON'T WORK.   Plus an eternity in hell or an eternity with a terroristic God? I think I will stick with being able to live with myself for even today, let alone an eternity.	And an eternity in hell for unrepentant, Christ-denying sinners is a good thing in your mind? With friends like you who lead people astray, who needs enemies?
0	islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage.	islam is very clear that mohammed received the quran from an angel. not god. as you may or may not know, satan is a fallen angel and islam is his religion which is proven by the hate, murder and death that it was built upon and has lived by since its founding.
1	Oh it applies, but if we were to look at the Bible that way, God wouldn't allow one single bad thing to happen.	And who was this passage directed towards? Not the general public I suppose.Just because the bible say's one fruit and one womb is blessed doesn't automatically mean they all are! If that were true God would make sure there were no such thing as a miscarriage.
0	You lost this debate Skeptic, why drag it back up again? There are plenty of other subjects that we could debate instead. Pick one of them and let's debate again. Alternatively, how about a formal debate on ID in which you never once mention Behe? That'll be a completely different one and worth considering.	...I feel that though the overwhelming number of objections brought up by Clive14 and the later objections by DE, I did not represent the Intelligent Design position as well as I could have, had I spent more time and thought on the debate. Therefore, I am offering in this thread a complete rebuttal of the objections to irreducible complexity that has been brought forth by DamEtel.If DamEtel wishes to do a formal debate on the subject, I am willing.So, here goes…
0	A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology).	I would like to address the theory of evolution point-by-point. Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory, I have used an explanation of Darwin's theory from Gould's book, "Full House." On page 138, Gould states:1) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.2) Offspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.3) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations. (We know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments. Since heredity exists, the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents. The accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change.
0	Well let's see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages, suddenly there was more support for a Federal Marriage Amendment than ever, Democrats lost more seats in Congress, the minority Democratic leader was defeated after years in office, a protestant presidential candidate carried the Catholic vote against a Catholic candidate, evangelicals in the country were energized, the pro-FMA candidate WON re-election even though his approval rating was 50%, and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it's up in the air again.The more you push you agenda through activist judges, the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment. At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election.	It's a step toward legal same-sex marriage in another jurisdiction. As it becomes legal in more areas, an amendment will be more difficult.
1	So, faith and argument from incredulity. If you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. Then maybe an actual scientist could take over.Major in molecular biology? Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.	No I do not think that all life comes from a single-celled ancestor in the distant past. The first reason for this is my faith in the inherent word of God. Secondly, throughout my college education (majoring in Molecular Biology) I have observed the complexities of the single-cell, and find it impossible to believe that it occurred by accident (though that may not be the best choice of words). The more and more we learn about cellular structure, the more complex we find it is and how these complexities are required in order for life to be present at all.
0	So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?	I don't place an objective value on all human life. Most people, when they are truly honest about it, don't. I know if I had to choose between my pet dog and a person I've never met, I would choose my dog. Similarly, other peoples babies hold no sentimental value for me. I just don't care about them.
1	Here come the Christians, thinking they can know everything by guessing, and commiting the genetic fallacy left and right.	okay, well i think that you are just finding reasons to go against Him. I think that you had some bad experiances when you were younger or a while ago that made you turn on God. You are looking for reasons, not very good ones i might add, to convince people.....either way, God loves you. :)
1	Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means?   Also that's what jeans were called before the word "jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?)   So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies?   Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment.	Yes through what is described as the heterosexual lifestyle. Besides you are very much an exception to the rule.P.S. Only homosexuals wear dungarees, and I'm Heterosexual.
1	Just to be pedantic, a better analogy would be: "If you are here, why do you have brothers and sisters?"	A similar question might be if you are here, why are your parents still alive?
0	It hasn't been proven that the Second Amendment is solely about tyrannical governments and not about dealing with violent criminals.	I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about.
0	Because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult. Any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature.	Guilty of the rapes I'm not disputing (don't know anything about those cases), but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed?
0	Pandion has already pointed out that this isn't a theory, it's a mode of wishful thinking. More damagingly, however, if you examine it for more than a moment it doesn't even fulfill the role you give it. You say 'many things in nature make no sense without God', but how do god's origins and nature make sense? Where did he/she/it spring from? All you do by invoking god as an 'explanation' is push the problems one step further back. The god hypothesis may look like an explanation, but it is not.	I, personally, believe in the theory that since many things in nature make no sense without God, he created the universe.
1	Whatever. First you say no one is calling you a hypocrite, than you say people do it, but it just an attack tactic. If you ever get to a mental state where you can entertain the possibility that a critisism of you can be grounded in reality, than go back to my post where I say "This is why..." and give it a read again. Maybe you'll learn somethig. Till then...	Yeah, I have noticed ad hominem tends to be a trend among a few folks here. Birds of a feather . . .
0	The article is saying that it was genetic changes. Changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes.	What's the difference between humans and chimps? According to the blowhards in the scientific world for the past 60 years, they said it was genetic mutations. But according to these three articles, including a September 2006 Science article it's cooked food and fire.....you see these things cause our genes to be expressed differently. ...We think gene expression is a major part of what separates chimps and humans," said Kevin White, an associate professor of genetics, ecology and evolution at Yale University in the United States. When we looked at gene expression, we found fairly small changes in 65 million years of macaque, orangutan and chimpanzee evolution," said Dr Yoav Gilad of the University of Chicago, lead author of the study. But he said it was followed by quick changes in specific groups of genes known as transcription factors, which control the expression of other genes, since humans diverged from their ape ancestors during the last 5 million years. "This rapid evolution in transcription factors occurred only in humans," Gilad added in a statement. ...
0	and i say you and everyone who denies christ is steeped in folly. reckon you'll see the errors of your reckless judgment in due time.	so they changed their religion. i did that too. i used to be christian.  what denial? i am not claiming either the jewish or christian faith is right or wrong. i am just saying you look like an idiot when you claim to know more about the jewish faith than jews. this is, like, the 4th time i have said this. do you understand me yet? promise???!!! no more preaching to me? you will actually address my arguments going forward rather than quoting scriptures? read what i actually write versuse whatever the voices in your head are saying? i await breathlessly! emoticonxhoho
0	Could you perhaps define "teleology" as you understand it and say why you believe there is teleology in the universe?	There is a teleology in the universe, but it's far more subtle and pervasive than you seem to think it is.
1	Interestingly everyone but 'the left' can assimilate what is being said, however, the left is notorious for their ever-present attitude that everyone else is mindless. You don't got no brownie points.....	Just so we're clear, your position is because christians lived in the US, therefore the US was founded as a christian nation? That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Sam Walton was a christian, and many christians worked in his first stores and continue to do so, so using your logic Wal-Mart is a christian company "founded on Judeo-Christian precepts" (which you still have failed to list or support in any way).
1	Which you would do by having teachers teach kids that being gay is alright. You would teach those kids, against their parents wishes, that being gay is alright. You would do that after you make it legal WITHOUT A POPULAR VOTE. Seems that you really don't give a rat's XXX about this poor dead kid at all. You just see his corpse and throw him on top of your gay marriage banner. How noble of you.	The solution is for people like you to look past their own "morality" and past their own noses!
1	wow, thanks for admitting how you really feel about sex apparently. never given your so-called 'wife' an orgasm eh? i sure could...lol...	sex is over rated. people should only have sex in order to reproduce. ;)
1	i'm surprised that some of the more frothing liberals here have not yet suggested that we now have a way of tracking and potentially treating the 'abnormal' brains of conservatives.	sort of like saying you are born conservative, it's not a life style choice?

0	A little of both. Japan is known for allowing its police officers to physically and mentally torture suspects and deny them legal counsel if they determine that such counsel will interfere with their interrogation. Suspects aren't allowed to read confessions before signing them either.Is that what Penfold really wants?	Are you refering to Japan or some hypothetical police state?

0	Jake good try at manipulating scriptures. Jesus is all about family values. The point of thsoe scriptures is that His gospel is above everything else. The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.	According to Jesus in the New Testament, here is hate and family values..."If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."Luke 14:26 (KJV) "For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."Matthew 10:34"And everyone that hath foresaken houses, brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life."Matt. 19:29"And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death." Matthew 10:21
1	Including the mentally ill, those with previous violent felonies, and children?	Anyone not currently in prison.
0	This makes more sense then anything else I've heard on this thread.	This applies only when men strive...that is fight. If a man "Accidently" hits a woman while in a fight and causes her to lose her child then all he has to do is pay a fine. But if he keeps fighting and hurt other people he gets killed. Even in the Bible you dont get punished so severly on accidents.
0	There is some truth here. Did you ever see "Independence Day"? They were taking pot-shots at the alien ships when they first arrived. It didn't stop the aliens... sure only a film... let's look at real life...modern - Iraq - Sadaam gave guns out to the people just before Gulf War IInot so modern - Boer War - Dutch farmers in South Africa were all excellent marksmen - Britain still invaded.US Civil War - I believe that the Confederate States were pretty well armed as far as the white citizens were concerned. US still invaded.	I'm sure invading armies would be deterred by people sniping them off at random (which is what would happen if any ever tried an invasion of America, especially in the rural areas)
0	correct, of all the freedoms most dear is the right to be left to **** alone.	no it hasn't, that's my point. the constitution gives every free american the right to bear arms.. i fully support that and all other rights . the government should stay out of it, but history proves they won't.
0	never heard of it. tell me, what is the most troubling thing you have read in this bill so far? one thing i did not like was that it required me to buy insurance or pay a fine.	emoticonxwowtrying to weed through this mess reminds me of the govenor on the movie 'best little whore house in texas' if you remember the song just a little side step!
1	What, you mean like this story (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003? Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example.	Ocean acidity is old news...
0	Actually the majority of homosexuals will tell you it's not a choice. And I, being the wacky gal I am, have a tendency to believe the word of homosexuals on that particular subject over the word of straight neonazicons.	All of a sudden in the last 10 years they are trying to convice us that homosexuality is not "wrong" its a "choice"
1	But you said that you saw standing aside whilst someone murdered another was cowardly? ::sigh::Let me simplify for you. Do you kill someone to prevent a murder?	I too believe that abortion is murder, however a) bombing a clinic involves the chance of killing other people - what about the postman delivering a package to the clinic. b) there are, in these cases I believe, other means of 'protest' c) if you do protest you should also be willing to support women who choose not to have an abortion... responsibility on this issue goes much deeper.
1	Make up your mind. Is it because of diet or is it because of evolution. It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it.	It's a result of Dr. Pepper, Cheetos, microwave popcorn, macaroni and cheese, hot dogs, pretzels, gum drops, high fructose corn syrup, flavors, colorings, transfats etc etc etc.......
1	Maybe I wanted it from a source that was worth looking at	You asked where it was written, I gave it to you.Unless, you really didn't want me to answer.
1	Funny how people who are "for" capital punishment don't see it that way...	I agree entirely. Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.
0	And from this we are to infer that Leakey doubts human evolution? There is by now a huge variety of fossil hominids. If Leakey was admitting that it was difficult to be certain which were or were not directly ancestral to modern humans, this is no more than scientific honesty.	Richard Leakey: "If I were going to draw a family tree for man, I would just draw a huge question mark."
0	Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born. And as I've said, there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption.	Oh, really, pregnancy is not expensive? Have you gone through a pregnancy? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies, and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits, to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands (tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth). Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive. As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it. If you think otherwise, you are sadly mistaken.
0	Like blacks once were? Wasn't that the main thrust of the 14th amendment and incorporation? Given incorporation, imagine the suits those acts of discrimination would bring emoticonXGood	I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.
1	Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.	BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.
0	Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have.	since we already had one example of a creationist lowlife tactic in the george gaylord simpson quote, i decided to skim the site and see if i could find another. i did. gee, gives the impression that dr. david m. raup, curator of geology, museum of natural history, chicago, puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution, helping support the preceding assertion that surely one’s belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific. but that’s not at all what dr. raup was stating. while googling for a fuller quote, i ran across a page that showed how this – and many other – statements by dr. raup were distorted by creationists.  to start with, here is a fuller quote: the page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to dr. raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a creationist journal (one of the quotes being the one being addressed here). of course dr. raup’s reply shows that he does not reject the fossil record, nor evolution, nor the fact that the fossil record documents evolution. the page also lists numerous other creationist distortions of dr. raup's statements.
1	It wasn't meant as an insult...just a statement of fact. I likely have as many or more inadequacies than do you.	corrected above, thank you, minus the insult that followed.It still stands however as a rational rebuttal.
1	Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?	For a long time they deceived me too….but after conversing with them day in and day out, I began to learn how their minds work and how to quickly spot their deceptions.
0	my question is: who's funding this?  no sane investor would give him the money needed to run such a operation especially in israel.	and certain versions of mark: 15he said to them, go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 16whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17and these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well. are they mistakenly reading this?
1	Seriously, in part is Waxy saying, I was here first? (It's my forum, I'll whine if I want to.)	What are you suggesting? Speak plainly please. Insults by implication are cowardly.
1	of course you can pass that sort of opinion off and some people actuall believe it. how on earth it can be tested? i guess we're only going to respect the sweeping generalisation a typical atheist trick!	if chrsitians were as vigilant about learning abut the rest of the world as they are learning about the scriptures. the world would be a wonderful place!
1	oh dear, and your argument against me is not based on what i've said, but what kind of person you perceive me to be. ouch!	your not commenting. your trying to convince people, you and your point of view is right. your trying to convince people here in the usa to follow your ideas.  is your father an aussie citizen? if he is, then he is no longer a us citizen. no need to answer, just a thought. i am sure your are not a us citizen. so your argument to convince people really does not matter does it? your attempts to convince people you are right and influence our policies sickens me. please take you imperialistic attitudes somewhere else.
1	Oh yes yes... never mind the thousands of lives destroyed, the shame, the guilt, the anger, the fear and all the while perhaps being in a combat zone and having that stress...  Never mind the hundreds of millions wasted retraining new people because we kicked out perfectly able people because of their sexuality...   All you can do is sit here and spew non threatening bunk to try and scare people and make your bigotry somewhat tangible to your warped mind...	your whacked out, godless drivel will be exposed for the foolishness it is come judgment day. if there need to be tears shed it should be for the loss of righteousness in the military due to the sodom and gomorrah crowd's abject godlessness.
0	what? you didn't know that religious people are the only ones that are supposed to be silent and never try to take part in democracy, while everyone else gets to do so? where have you been? emoticonxdonno  i wonder sometimes if opponents of religion really even stop to think about what they're really saying.	i'm not particularly shocked, nor worried, that the article shows that a particular group is seeking to merge government policy with their ideology. oh my, big shocker there. that is the nature of democracy.the truth is that everyone does this, not just people who happen to be religious. in fact, when you say 'these people need to be stopped,' you are seeking to have your ideology implemented on society. the problem here is inconsistency in that you seem to think it ok for you to merge your ideology and social policy, but it is not ok for other people to do so.
1	Look at Dunblane. Then look at Columbine. Who had the higher death toll?  How often do school shootings take place in Germany?  When was the last time somebody went driving and shooting in a killing spree in America?

Go on Brady, we're waiting for you to prove that you actually have a point. Don't disappoint us.	rivaled? not even close. you just cant stop making things up can you? in 2006, guns murdered: 18 in austria 27 in australia 59 in england and wales 60 in spain 190 in canada 194 in germany 10,177 in the united states

1	that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!	that's information to you, not to the organism. if someone says the mountain will not get higher on it's own, and you go and dump dirt on it; you have not disproven them. by information they mean that records anything useful for the organism, including specific functions. now the average anti-evolutionist would like it to be just specific functions in which case you could just say novelty (information on how to create new systems). dna records useful data (information) for other things, it records modifications of existing systems to adapt to the environment. deletions of detrimental code is also information, although the net change is a loss. as for my previous arguments, they have been that there is no known law, physics, or calculation that would cause the construction of an novel system; leaving only probability.

1	A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man. And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all.	OUCH! Err... what the - OOF! OW! Aw come on... ARRGH! DOWN BOY! Hi, allow me to introduce myself. I'm UNDETERRED! I have a tenth grade education and an internet connection. A while ago when I wanted to find out if there were any creatures with both gills and lungs, I found NEOTENIC AXOLOTLS. Like I said that was a while ago, and that's the name I remember. I have a vague recollection about neotenic meaning that it didn't pass a certain life stage, and apart from that I always thought axolotls were called axolotls. In my country they are, anyway. Now I ask you, what the HELL does it matter what the HELL I called it, as long as you know what it is (or can at least you can look it up, too). TIME TO UP YOUR MEDS. emoticonXMad

0	you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing	I agree completely. These christians make up their mind that something is in the bible and whatever it says is what it says. It is so hard to change their opinions.
1	wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake.	i don't pretend to know what is behind your movement, but you obviously hate society.
1	whooooosh. emoticonXBye  That was the sound of my point as it went over your head.  How much do you want to but I don't find any?  Go ahead bet me! Are you afraid?	gay sex was a sin then also. why do you think all of the states used to outlaw sodomy, and where do you think they got that from?  listen, go back 50 and 100 years and find me one major denomination that approved of gay sex sin, and then look at what bibles they were using. it should become clear after that.
0	So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict? That doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then I don't have much choice in the matter, do I? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If God is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. Deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.Unless of course, God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. But then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me.	Ok according to the bible God only created the first two beings, Adam and Eve. Now christians dont rule out science, and science has shown that we produce offspring. God has created these offspring but not directly. Think of photosynthesis, we eat meat, this is getting energy from the sun indirectly. So we have shown that we ourselves produce offspring but we are put here and given the abbility by God to produce offspring. As far as your question on why God alows addicts to have babies it can be explained as this. We where given the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict, wrong put we have the choice. God created us to have that choice, or else we would be robots. The bible also says God knows everything yet to come, so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby. God can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choices.
1	Buy stock in the failing banks? What a great investment. Tell me, where does the money come from?	I do. Buying into banks with tax dollars bolsters cash flow without printing new money. UK just bought 60 plus billion dollars worth of stock in three UK banks. We need to do the same...without assuming control of the banks.But why should I worry? Our saviour Obama will solve all of our problems when he "spreads the wealth around".

0	Although i personally oppose abortion,i agree that two wrongs dont make it right.	Exactly. If you are a child rapist and someone pops you in the head than you should go to jail for murder. Sorry, two wrongs don't make a right.
0	I'm not familiar with the book, so can't comment upon it first hand. However http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too. As I say I haven't read the original so cannot judge the quality of the link I'm supplying, so apologies in advance if it grossly misrepresents Mr Well's case.	Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrongby Jonathan WellsI appologise for not remembering the exact title, but its definately a good read.
0	You know, I heard that from my mom last week. My parents moved to Arkansas when my dad retired a few years back. Mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have. Ironic indeed.	The areas of America where divorce rates are highest are also frequently the areas where many conservative Christians live. Kentucky, Mississippi and Arkansas voted overwhelmingly for constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage. But they had three of the highest divorce rates in 2003, based on figures from the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics.http://www.sunherald.com/mld/thesunh...d/10179154.htm
0	Well it all depends on who is going to determine "right", isn't it? Abortion is not math. There are no finite answers. Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history. I do like Aristotle's take; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable.	Just because people have all sorts of views on the subject does not mean that there isn't a right answer.
1	wow! i didn't know that. thanks! should i read the new york times instead?	i would not be concerned considering the source - newsmax is a notoriously right-wing site that is hardly considered a reliable source.they are about as reliable as the john mccain campaign or fox news(hee hee). newsmax has a list of false claims. and quite personally, most of the claims seem kinda wacko - way out there. send it into factcheck or something.
1	Yeah, gassing and murdering 6,000,000 Jews doesn't qualify as suffering very much.   emoticonXRolleyes   I wonder how many slaves were killed by comparison........	I agree wiht you for the most part. however Jews ahve not suffered very much in terms of minorities like other minorities. I do think that popelpe should take advantage of the opportunities instead of just asking for more.That still doesn't change the fact that minorities are disadvantaged due to the government's actions and negligence.
0	along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen.	i fail to understand the fascination with mrs. kerry's wealth. george washington inherited wealth, including money and property. and then proceeded to marry the wealthiest widow in dc, who had far more wealth than george. the only reason i can fathom for people condemning kerry for marrying wealth is jealousy. all other things being equal, i'd take a well-traveled, multi-language, filthy rich woman actively engaged in various sectors of society over a dirt-poor librarian every time. (no slur on librarians, i know some who are fine people, including a wealthy one, just a comparison for the thread) as to mrs. kerry's tax filing extension, that's available to any and all taxpayers. all one does is pay the taxes due and request an automatic extension for filing. and that extension can, with reasonable cause, be again extended all the way into october.
1	Symbiote seems to have had a large hair across his butt.	The proof is in the pudding.. I suggest that you read my post again and let me know if you disagree with any of my opinions. If not, then you have to come to the conclusion that God does not exsist... God's only exsistance in the minds of believers just as was the case with believers of different Gods throughout human history. I do not understand what you are referring to when you said, "just admit you are a faith based preacher, as bad as any fundamentalist"? By the way it should be ovious that I am an atheist.
1	You'd have to drown a few puppies too. Kittens might do, but you might fall a little short.	Gee! Is that all it takes? You mean I could commit fraud, become a child molester, kill a few people, rob a few banks and still be treated as normal as long as I support the ban?emoticonXRolleyesI think you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan.
0	I'm afraid it is you who is wrong. I created you so that you would think you created me to think I created everything, even though I did. It's more of a challenge that way to try to convert people to the one true religion. Since you can see that I won't be able to convert the world (it's due in a week), you can pay $100 dollars to me so I will take you with me to the upper world.	I'm afraid you're wrong, as I created you in my universe, and implanted in you a belief that you were a god. It lead you to make statements about the truth of your own beliefs, which I'm afraid are just self-beliefs with no real evidence.Sorry.
0	fair enough. i tend to run skeptic. i am surprised that i am a theist. if you were to believe in a god, which would it be?	i don't believe in any gods because like you said there's nobody who can prove they exist. there's no evidence to support any supernatural things so therfore the only logical conclusion is to not accept them. thus i am not convinced

0	And that is different how? I told johnny to write that I'm infallible. Therefore the book that I told johnny to write proves I'm infallible. There is no difference.   You do realize that there are other religions out there? That science is constantly updating?   Your arguments have been nothing more then false dichotomies assuming there are only two choices despite history laughing in your face.	the bible. god did not write the bible, he inspired the people to write it. you are right, no logical contradiction exists. what is option c? i thought there were only evo or creo to choose from.
1	Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?  Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world.	originally posted by wsm2506: personally, i think it is the inability of mankind to accept the fact of their eventual mortality. so, they conjure up 'gods' that reward or punish with 'everlasting life' (immortality). it has been true through out history. nice observation, chum, but the real god - the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob - is alive and well and wants to see you when you die.
0	Yes yes, this was all covered in Wells' previous book, Icons of Evolution. It has been refuted numerous times (some even on this forum). See here for a thorough debunking.	Wells also shows how most of the other "evidence" for evolution -- including textbook "icons" such as Peppered Moths, Darwin's Finches, Haeckel's Embryos, and the Tree of Life -- has been exaggerated, distorted . . . or even faked.
1	Methinks it's rather obvious that mintaka is JimIrvine because no rational newbie would come here and agree with Irvine's ridiculous and juvenile attacks/assertions out of the box. emoticonXRolleyes	Reading around, first post, might as well land here too. Notice that one doesn't post much more than sheep jokes. With his cutie not far behind. Is religion in general on the decline? Monotheism is. Best wishes.
1	If we could rub a brass lamp, make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately, I'd agree with you. But since we live in the REAL WORLD, we must become OIL INDEPENDENT while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources.	Promoting renewables is a good thing, but increasing the supply of oil in counter productive in helping renewables to reach the critical mass needed to survive economically.
0	Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made "morals and ethics" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men.	I think that Darwin and Dawkins have made the issue of "morals and ethics" a joke.
0	Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848.	That's not true according to the textbook claim: "Before the industrial revolution, *most* of the moths were *light*. This was because the *dark* forms resting on light tree-trunks were more easily spotted, and thus eaten, by birds. When pollution darkened the tree trunks, the *light* forms then had less camouflage, so they were preferentially eaten by birds, and the *dark* forms became dominant in the population.

1	two reasons: first, i come from a jewish family, and i've never heard of this before. now, i'll grant that nothing says that i should have, but this is news to me. second, and more importantly, trebor is not the person who made the positive claim; you are. it is your burden of proof. no one here can blame me for questioning your bare assertions given your history with falsehoods. so if he doesn't respond in a mere three hours, you declare victory? how about you call me presumptuous again? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you aren't able to back up your claim. congratulations. try it next time without accusing somebody of being cowardly and misleading.	and neither did trebor post any evidence of his claim. why aren't you questioning him? but i suspect that trebor has asked those with better recollections of the time than he has and they have confirmed for him that what i said is true, which is why he hasn't come back and refuted my response to him. i know this info is true. i just couldn't find anything on-line that stated when isaiah was dropped from the traditional reading in american jewish temples. sorry...
0	The memo is real, nobody has ever been able to disprove it. Handgun Control Inc. (the people who later became the Brady Campaign) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position. However them simply stating this, is no different than Obama making a statement on national news, and then several months later saying "I never said that" and trying to reverse his position.Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda, the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after.	As the "leak" appears to have happened SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, she may have difficulty catching up with that. ;)
0	Apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the Illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the Constitutions. It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it. The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down. Knowing the State of Illinois, I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners.   The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time.	To think that a common sense measure like this could come out of a senseless place like Illinois.

0	an image is not the original. a photo of you is not you, its an image of you. the image cannot be or replace the original, and isnt intended toregardless of how "perfect" the photocopier is, you cannot cash the "perfect" copy of the check. it may be a perfect replica, to the detail, but it is still only an image. the problem isnt the quality of the copying process, but the fact that the copy itself is just that, a copy, not the original	unkerpaulieI think your analogy breaks down with a little thought. If I have a check for a million dollars and I take it to a copy machine and make a copy, I am quite aware that the copy will not be perfect. There is an imperfect mechanical divice between the check and the copy. Or are you saying that God has a big imperfect copy machine that he jumps into and out pops an imperfect copy.My thought was that God was the direct agent of creation (without the use of intervening mechanical devices), and being a perfect Being incapable creating imperfection (for then He would not be God), all of His creation would be as perfect as He is.So does this perfect God have a spine that is a plethora of engineering disasters?
0	are you trying to say that people of faith cannot tell the difference between myth and reality? i'm actually confused by this sentence.	mastershake, i could never argue against a religion that is based on faith. an argument or debate is based on reason and logic and faith-based religions are not reasonable or logical. are we agreed now that faith cannot differentiate between *truth and falsity*? *edited  cthulhu, unfortunately we couldn't even prove one of them wrong because they are faith based.
1	Yes, some people are jumping ship, which is a crying shame. STICK TO YOUR GUNS MEN! WE'RE WINNING!	It seems that the creationists are beginning to change there views.evolution can be explained by science but creation relys on myth, superstition and hope, but few people are now suggesting that the two theories can be explained together, god started everything then evolution took over.Its like the creationist is trying to put one over the evolutionist by suggesting that god created evolution.But in reality i think a person who believes in creation is coming to terms that the creation theory is a bit far fetched and the evolution theory makes more sense, but due to religious conditioning still continue to grasp on the creation theory.Which really means the bible would be disregarded as a source of information.
1	And the funeral dirge of the Left and comparisons to Nazi Germany and/or the collapse of the Roman Empire will begin in 3....2.....	In a 78-22 vote, the senate voted to confirm Judge Roberts for the position of Chief Justice of SCOTUS. My impression of the man, so far, is that he seems to be a man of integrity, a brilliant lawyer, and very humble. The proceedings went very smooth, except for the obligatory parade of left-wing special interest groups. Well, now the fun begins with the second nominee to succeed retiring justice Sandra Day O'Connor. My money is on either Priscilla Owens or Janice Rogers-Brown. Your thoughts.
0	assumption of 'millions'. they must of because how else can we account for the species today ? got any support for this ? i can prove the antidiluvians knew about and used pi. if man began as an ape/animal then how do you explain the fact that pi was not discovered until thousands of years later ? ray m.	so you are saying that genesis is a scientific fact. ok, so how did all the millions of species of life fit on a 450 ft wooden ship? pi = 3.14159265......... the bible says pi = 3. ok, how about that pi = 3? doh! sorry. try again. emoticonxangel

1	You are so FUN. Its amazing to hear you say this considering how much you applaud a law that pretty much allows this in Arizona.	You're taking that stance again? Arrest people for whatever excuse is convenient and simply let the courts sort out the details at a later date, requiring the accused to pay large sums of money to prove their own innocence?Hardly a civilized approach to the law. Assuming people are guilty and treating them as such, until such time that they can prove that they're actually innocent, just isn't the way to do things.
1	So I take it you don't accept my challenge on the basis that it is impossible? Why is it impossible? Or better yet, why don't we al just evolve into perfect, anti-sinning creatures with 500 IQ points a piece?	Ah yes the oldest con game in the world. Set up the game so its impossible to comply with the rules, then use the guilt effect to control the test subject. The Christians have managed to commercialize the whole concept on a mass scale. And even if a test subject thinks it has won the game and exhibits no guilt - there is always the mythical original and heritable sin to fall back on. In Adams fall we sinned all. Guilt is the father of ........ economic returns!

0	No one wants to take your "marriage" away Matt. It's a free country--no one's going to block your way to any chapel that will marry you. Do your gay thing. But let marriage be marriage--it's a different matter. People just want to keep you from tampering with the institution of marriage.	My husband and I will be married in windsor this comming June. It will be good that there will be one place in this world that our family will be considered a family. There is nothing the conservatives, republicans, or chistonazis can do to stop or take this license from us. I might just do a twist and sue in Canadian courts to have all marriages preformed in the United States not be recognized. So all those heteros passing into Canada will not be considered married unless married in Canada. Wounldn't that be a hoot.
0	Exactly. It is their fault, but they can do what they choose. It is punishment and you know it, and it is not your job to make sure no "irresponsible" pregnant woman goes unpunished.	First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said "They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.
0	And yet, for most pro-choice folk on these forums, this question really is meaningless. For, even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights, they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable. Even you believe this Shooter.	Lets break this down. Most pro-choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts, or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights. The Lifers say that it should have rights regardless of its physical state.
1	Good observation! He is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content. He is one of the more fellatious people I know and you won't find him taking notice of the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land either.	People who own weapons aren't responsible for combating or preventing crime in general. Gun ownership doesn't commit us to becoming default cops. What ownership does is allow us to protect ourselves in the event of an armed criminal attack. So the basis for your articles thesis is fallacious in expecting armed people to somehow become extensions of law enforcement in order to justify being armed.Therefore, the only rational response to your premise is to encourage more law abiding people to be armed and trained so as to outnumber the armed criminals so they will have no unarmed citizens to victimize. That is the most effective way to intimidate the lawless criminals into never using their weapons for violence for fear that their intended victim may actually be better armed then they are.

0	hmmmm..., unwanted competition...., i guess you are all on that database then ;)	the problem, however, becomes more manageable once you realize that all you need is a computer with a database that shows where all the food/water hoarders live. no such database exists, to the best of my knowledge; certainly not one we could gain access to. and in any event, post-apocalypse technology will be limited to things that operate without electricity, for the most part, so maintaining and powering a computer after the end of the world would be pretty much impossible. i think you need to take your plan back to the drawing board, as it all hinges on this one ill conceived idea.  also, even if your computer idea worked and was a reality, you just told a whole bunch of people about it, so now you have unwanted competition.
1	doh, you used the 'l' word. how dare ye! (tsk, tsk) :p don't you know? you can't use the term 'lifestyle,' you have to use the description of lifestyle instead. that usually works much better. gotta know the rules to talk with the gay rights folk here, don't ya know? lol see, if you use the word, they can't stay on topic and so then your use of the 'l' word becomes the topic. it's just too damn distracting for 'em.	i honestly don't care what you believe about my comment but the reality is you were prejudice about it while at the same time claiming i was the prejudice one. it honestly makes me laugh because it was that ironic. the simple fact that i rarely/never use the word 'lifestyle' for 'gay' would indicate that i meant something different than 'gay'.  unlike many i use words that i find represent what i try to get across. for those that don't know what the word 'lifestyle' means i have taken the liberty to post it for you below: the habits, attitudes, tastes, moral standards, economic level, etc., that together constitute the mode of living of an individual or group. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lifestyle
0	Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.	all of the british papers keep going on about how bad it is, how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets, how guns are being imported into britain and resold through underground channels, how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage, etc. now who should we believe more, your or the papers that relate the news to us?

1	So it's your contention that hundreds of thousands of firearms stolen from residences annually is just par for the course?	What is the problem here? Guns or crooks stealing guns? They steal from all of society including LEOs,the military etc. not unlike the situation in Mexico. Proof is in that most of those thefts were from government sources. It is correct there is no authority granted Con-gress in Article 1, section 8 to legislate rights restrictions and recently in Heller that was reinforced.When are you leaving? :) Watch the doorknobs on the way out and all that stuff.
1	Um, of course, it was too much to expect murderers to shell out for burying their victims. I keep forgetting I'm in Dick Cheney's America.	Once a person's dead they're dead. It's nice, but if you can't afford it, why bankroll a cremation or burial? With growing numbers of bodies and the associated public health risks around disease, this is one more example of how the state will increasingly find themselves in a bind over health care for all.

0	I think an open mind is the best thing to have when it comes to theories. I think there is some truth in everything.	That's true, as long as ones pursuit of science is really science. In the case of "creation science," there is no science involved. As trebor has said, "creation science" is an attempt to find scientific sounding reasons that can be used to justify the conclusions that have already been reached and that are not subject to change. That's how "creation science" works. Begin with the conclusion and then search for scientific sounding justification.Real science is a process and a way of learning.

Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this: "My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject".Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it.

Those poor girls and women who go through abortions did what they had to do, more than you could ever do. Don't stand on your high horse and lecture the world on the virtuousness of your position. Don't talk about being virtuous, be virtuous. A "real man" helps those who he loves, whether he likes what they did. A father loves his sons and daughters, despite what they do, rather in spite of what they have done. Good day to you.
1	Oh please... You just refuse to acknowledge anything of a victory for LGBT people.	The people didn't vote, so the winning streak still stands.Besides, the majority on that one are morally-challenged, spiritually-stunted imbeciles.
1	Very Interesting! After only 33 posts Mintaka already has the political and gun advocacy priorities of individual members here down pat; or should I say the resurrected antonia, our resident National socialist healthcare freak does and couldn't help but expose her personal insights where none should exist for this alleged newbie.	How ironic you would even care since (1) you've opposed saving the lives of 101,000 of your fellow Americans who died this past year because of inadequate care, and (2) you think people should defend themselves with their own guns and stop burdening taxpayers with police departments.Oh and do take notice of the costly tasteless suit who came downstairs from the corporate palaces to arrogantly stand next to the underpaid cop in N.Y.C., and as if he owned the city's police forces.Anyone know that Costly Tasteless Suit's name?
0	SNIPThis opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an "assault weapons ban" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier.	"The belief that there are approximately 20,000 gun-control laws in the United States has become received wisdom..... But as it turns out, there appears to be little basis for the number....
0	Old news. There have been accusations of similar stories for years.	With that established, I would be interested in your comments.
0	YOU LIAR.You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said "FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS" in North Carolina 1 year later.And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?	The Truth: Heston took his NRA show to Denver and did and said exactly what we recounted <movie.php?mov=heston>. From the end of my narration setting up Heston's speech in Denver, with my words, "a big pro-gun rally," every word out of Charlton Heston's mouth was uttered right there in Denver, just 10 days after the Columbine tragedy. But don't take my word – read the transcript of his whole speech <heston.php>. Heston devotes the entire speech to challenging the Denver mayor and mocking the mayor's pleas that the NRA "don't come here." Far from deliberately editing the film to make Heston look worse, I chose to leave most of this out and not make Heston look as evil as he actually was. .
0	dear chloe, do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion? that is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote, embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of human beings. if one kills a human being, one is guilty of murder.	silly chloe...how can a part of the womens body other than her own mouth cry? :p
1	Yet another non-response. (We're not going to have to start counting these, are we?) It fails to address your dilemma of the "just are" theories.	Some theories are philosophical, and some are not. It's often hard to distinguish between them, and that's how some scientists like it.

1	Yes...I think I would agree with you. That's what happens when you have superstition coupled with self-imposed ignorance I suppose. It's a shame!	The poorest part of America is the bible belt.Along with that, infant mortality rates approaching some third world countries plus all the stuff we have already talked about makes me believe that something is wrong there and it has to do with the bible.
1	Did you slip in it AGAIN? Were you led astray by a passage from Heller you thought you could use to legitimize gun control, your wet dream?I submit from many past rulings of the courts that little statement is in error.	Eugene Volokh • July 29, 2010 11:48 pm  Friday, the Michigan Supreme Court handed down an interesting case — People v. Dupree on this. The case is not novel, and my sense is that the defense is generally recognized: Just as what would otherwise be the crime of murder, attempted murder, battery, and the like might be justified if done in defense against an imminent threat, so a felon’s taking possession of a gun is justified if done in defense against an imminent threat. (The defense does not apply to a felon’s arming himself against a possible threat of attack at some indefinite future time.) Still, the case struck me as an interesting illustration. Thanks to Jason C. Miller for the pointer.

0	And depending on what human is "finding the answers" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings.	Some people attempt to explain unknown causes in nature by God's direct intervention. This has been called, "the God of the gaps." While God could certainly intervene in the natural process (called a miracle), to make God responsible for common natural phenomena means that as each scientific discovery finds a natural explanation of what was previously attributed to God, the direct intervention of God becomes unnecessary. That is, as the gaps in knowledge become smaller, the God of these gaps becomes correspondingly smaller. People with this mentality see science as a threat to their faith. Obviously, were such a view held by the founders of modern science, there would have been no incentive to find answers to the natural phenomena. Understanding these natural phenomena as secondary causes, places God above them where increased ability to explain how they occur not only does not "decrease" God, but adds wonder to His creation." http://www.leaderu.com/offices/o_hel...dor_faith.html

0	Actually, this (if what that article is true, which I am not quite sure) is a healthy part of science. Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare. Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed. Man's theories change everyday, while God's word has remained the same.	For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad.

Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures.

0	There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.	The coelacanth, according to fossil records, and according to evolutionists, allegedly went extinct millions and millions of years ago.Until they were found alive.Coelacanth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaAs if this should be any surprise. The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science.

0	First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition.	You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.
0	Agreed that they are still the same species, much like the "13 species" of Darwin's Finches, and I have no problem with evolution in that respect. I can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time. But I still don't see where evolution, in that sense of the term, can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest, or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland.	No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution.
0	freedom dearie are you serious about pepper spray? just yesterday i presented a story where a taser and bean bag rounds from a shotgun did literally nothing against a 68 year old with a bad heart condition. what can a cheap chemical agent do against an adrenaline charged youth who's got more vitality and health on his side than a senior citizen in new york?	we are all entitled to self-defense, but not all that is legal or moral is advisable. i am not against gun rights, or for the mad-regulators of the left; but if i were zimmerman right now (assuming he is telling the truth) i would be kicking myself now until the day i die for not carrying pepper spray and trying that first. for investigating further when the police told me to keep my distance. for not telling martin i had a gun and i was willing to use it before he got close enough to knock me down. i agree there is plenty of possible damning evidence either way. one piece that would change everything is if zimmerman threw the first punch; in which case trayvon would be defending himself and maybe zimmerman shot him because he was losing. that would not contradict known facts.

0	A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one.	Then banning same-sex marrige would be wrong, and there would be no reason for it. Unless it harms someone, a law should never be passed.

0	Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't "on the grounds," although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property. It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district. The children go to the seminary on released-time, which has been found to be constitutional (although I don't see how).Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are:McCollum v. Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306)McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that "accommodating" religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not.	I live in Utah and every public school has a building on the grounds called the seminary.

0	And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. That's not what a Democracy is about, at least not our Democracy.	If minorities' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives, then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system.

0	The fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method.

Mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others I have spoke with on this subject. I do believe in scientific method, but I also have faith that god is out there.	lol. That's silly. Scientific facts keep changing, because they keep building on what is proven. The actual basis for the facts hasn't changed at all, merely the newest accepted idea is. As time progresses that idea is tested, tested, tested and tested again until it is proven. Your statement reveals sheer ignorance as to the scientific process.

All I'm saying is that the 2 year gap (until more info is given there) can not be considered the biggest problem.	Similarly, if you're boyfriend is happy to have sex with someone 2 years younger than he is (which is a pretty significant age gap at that age)...
1	you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise.	Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.
0	what if it's got nothing to with bigotry? what if, like religion, it takes absolute proof in order to be believed? i think that's what it's going to take. don't you?	no matter what science is out there, even if it spelled out completely that sexuality is genetic. some peoples prejudices will prevail on them. in other words they will never believe it anyway!
0	Actually, it has.      The last time I checked, well still have gay marriages in Massachusetts. As a matter of fact, it seems that it is difficult for most politicians to be elcted in the state without being supportive of marriage equality.	that didn't seem to hold up did it? just because mass and cal. said it was alright did make it alright for the rest of the country.2 liberal states didn't push the rest of the country to follow like sheep to a slaughter.
1	Wow Archie, way to suck the fun out of something. Let me use your words here:	No, you're mixed up. You see, Superman is a fictional comic book character who was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster back in the 30s. Jesus is the true Messiah of humanity who in fact did save the World from Spiritual Darkness. He defeated death and even travelled in ways that defied the laws of physics after being crucified and presumed dead by His murderers. Jesus Christ is the real Superman. Any powers you attribute to the fictional character Superman, you can accurately attribute to Jesus and you wont find him wanting. I'm a real fan of Superman, but I love, worship and trust my eternal life to Jesus Christ. With that said, I'm calling it a night and have no desire to help you continue to mock the Lord.
1	you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.	you flaming liberals are really something else. at least we're generous with our own money. you radicals help the poor using other people's money. then you keep them on your government plantation so they can vote to keep you in power. sieg heil!!

0	what knowledge do you have concerning haliburton?  they are a conglomeration construction companies who, because of their qualifications, get overseas contracts. knowledge of codes and history of quality being factors. you seem to oppose their success. why?	iceland, new zealand, australia, and loads of other countries would just love to see us fall on our over bearing butt's. well good for iceland, maybe if more countries turn down our blood money , we can bring the troops home from the 120 bases they are stationed around the world. put them quarding our borders and growl at any body who even looks our way till the rest of the world forgets we are here. oops i forgot haliburton wouldn't be making money then.  can't have that so i guess we will just continue to be a nation of war mongers.

1	So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.	I believed and hoped in the possibility.It was Jesus, the living son of God.. he had feet, hands, legs - he had a body yes.I never looked at his face, but i knew who it was - for one thing nobody walks around in robes anywhere near where I live. I could also see the marks on his feet when I got up close... My friends who were with me did not see him, but I am not suprised they were engrossed in their conversation, I left their side and they did not realise I had left.
0	Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of "arms" include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case.	We saw this in the recent Supreme Court decision. They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals, but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms. Thus, the Supreme Court chose to "strain at a gnat and swallow a camel" to use a Biblical idiom in their treatment of the Second Amendment.
0	And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality.	People do not like to be cheated. They do not like to be victims of fraud. If economic systems are not governed and regulated, people can be victimized by the systems.
1	knowing more than just a little about my fte compadres, and those that i know personally, they would fight along beside me and i them to preserve our freedoms. to go as far to bow down? when they have taken what smidgen of life is left in me. but in direct answer to your post, jim: they are doing so as we speak.	every person should attempt to preserve what they hold dear.  if the atheist is a objectivst who loves the ideal of freedom and capatalism then they will probably support a battle against the terrorists. if the atheist is a communist, he may not really care if america is destroyed. (i only mentioned objectivst and communist as examples i am aware that their are other forms of atheism and i do not need to be informed of this. i'm also aware that not all communists are atheists.) what do you mean 'the civil rights of terrorists'. i haven't heard any atheists or non atheists suggest such a thing.
0	what does that have to do with the issue being discussed? unless you're suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing. is that the point you're trying to make? beside, by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians, you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is. so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all?	hey archie, have you watched for the bible tells me so yet?
0	Sucide? Isn't that a mental health issue? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person, does that cure depression?   If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide.   If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide.	i doubt it. a story on the news today. those who have firearms in their homes are more likely to die of murder and are more likely to die from suicide. interesting.
0	i'm sorry, but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded. i can see (remotely) how abortion might be considered anti-woman (although it is of course anti-life before being anything else), but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women's suffrage, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, etc.? by the way, do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion? i am catholic, and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned (except abortion, because it has nothing to do with women's rights) are viewed positively by the catholic church, or ever have been. please explain with details.	abortion, voting, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, equal pay and the list goes on. in the us as recently as 50-years ago, the list was endless if the woman was black living in certain us states. we were making some social progress, but that seems to be slowing in several states as our government imposed siege mentality rolls out the same old insecurities. as posted by tastyfish in kinder terms, fundamentalists consider the past century of advancement of womens rights as a bad thing; barefoot, pregnant, uneducated and chained in the hut being their ideal woman.
0	oh yes we can. invoking god is not an explanation for ultimate origins, it's the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declaring further application of the question off limits. simply declaring that god's origin doesn't need explaining does not make that so.	good start. now the question becomes where did the stuff for the big bang come from? you see, this could go on for a while, because the next logical question is 'where did that stuff come from' and so on. no one could ask the same thing about a god. the god of the bible is supposedly self existent. one could say that about the universe, but given the big bang hypothesis, that does not fly. so now what? huck
0	And here our Government recognizes:  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people	Fundamental RightsThis relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.
0	If this is what passes for American healthcare, then your need for change is even more desperate. None of these "treatments" is available on the NHS.	Current 'treatment' includes:Use of a placeboLaying on of handsPrayerTossing salt over thy shoulderPlanting 3 kernels of rice in the ground under your homeSaying the Pledge of AllegienceAnd thanking the Obamasiah for a bountiful crop of beets.Oh, and if you can locate the witch, have her confess to the crime of making you ill...and punished for doing so...you stand a better chance of living longer with said cancers.
1	And I'm sure you of all people know the mind of God... Please, you just take snippets of scripture, and twist it into well this is absolute. God loves gays and lesbians, but you fling god out as a way to justify your slander and bigotry.	<flush>God doesn't accept illicit gay sex sin.And what did Jesus try to tell carnal sinners? REPENT? Where's the repentance?So don't give me that "God accepts gay marriage, etc." garbage. That's the liberal left chanting that, not God.
0	Does the sexual orientation of the would-be single parent even come up?	Folks should be aware that every state in the United States except Florida allows gay people to adopt as single parents. The issue comes in many states when a same-sex spouse tries to adopt as a second parent. Some states permit this and some states do not. It's weird indeed that all states except one allow single gay people to adopt children, but many do not allow gay couples to be adoptive parents together. It makes no sense to me, since two parents are usually better than one.
1	You never bought something you liked? You never went somewhere with someone you liked or went to meet them?	You don't make decisions based on emotion.The only connection between morals and emotion I have ever made was that properly a persons emotions should be controlled by their beliefs on morality.
0	What issues? You drivel on about breasts forming on lizards (even though the most primitive milk secretors we have today don't have anatomically distinct mammary glands, and the earliest mammals evolved from reptiles not remotely like lizards), then triumphantly crown your straw man with what you seem to think is a knock-down point about nerve connections.Yes, SS, the most primitive milk-secreting structures we know are modified sweat glands; your incredulity does not alter that fact one iota. And guess what? Sweat glands have nerve connections to the hypothalamus...	ssues I raised in my OP regarding the initial formation of breasts.
0	The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the "quality of life" test.	A position of pro-choice is pro-life because the lives and quality of life of women are valued.
1	perhaps you would like to explain simplistic.  Is the anthropic principle simplistic?  What natural law created natural law?  Where did the information come from?  Is matter creating matter simplistic? Matter creating information?

I fail to see how it is therefore relevent to any debate on abortion.	...Also, the baby has its own blood, its own immune system, and contains its own calories once consumed. theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion. Just like you need food everyday...
0	Yes, T. Kennedy is the alias of a known terrorist, and Ted Kennedy got punished because of it. And many are advocating that such a system be used to deny Second Amendment rights and be used to try innocent people in a court of law.	Nothing. "T. Kennedy" is an alias of a known terrorist.

0	Sounds like the same skeptic argument above. I don't know about you Nu Leader, but when I'm certain my mind exists. Are you not certain? You are actually required to be, to deny you exist would require existence, and that would be logically contradictory.	If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is "true"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.
1	then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? silly, i 'd say! humans are part of the animal kingdom. mammals if i remember from biology. are you not an animal? if not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon.	for me the reason i don't 'give it credit' is that it's irrelevant--i don't see how it matter either way way if sexual 'orientation' is natural or not. it's a separate issue from the moral one. remember, it's natural for animals to do many things--some species' males impregnate the females and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it's own. but just because such behavior exists among animals doesn't make it moral in humans. in fact i'd call it immoral. there are many such examples in the animal kingdom. natural doesn't mean it's automatically moral.
0	Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said "You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term." I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted.	Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women. Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for "choice" remains consistent.Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children? Do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of China for example? The woman's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her. Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy). Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice?Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples?
0	Well he has further political aspirations..........The 9th circuit in Sodom (SF) is always making law instead of interpreting it........That is why they are over ruled so often.......	Hate to burst your ballon, but the mayor of San Francisco had JUST been elected. He doesn't need to worry about votes for a long time.Judges are supposed to rule on the Constitutionality of laws when asked to do so. They are doing their job. If it violates the Constitution it is illegal. Plain and simple. They are not making law.
0	He had ALREADY MADE the animals. "now the Lord God HAD FORMED..." not "now the Lord God formed..." See the difference? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam. He made the animals before Adam.	That interpretation is fine except that God says, "I WILL make a helper suitable for him." He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.
1	i'm surprised no one has unearthed some stickman figures and announced that the drawings of jesus have been discovered, as recorded in john 8:7, where he's doodling on the ground while some poor young woman is about to get pelted with rocks. what a pilgrimage that would make...	i would love to see the evidence for that. alas, there is none. i think there one italian archelogist who claims he found some drawings that he believes that the 'mount sinia' mentioned is different than generally accepted, but i am skeptical of his claims. there are enough screwballs and religious nuts pretending to be archelogists in israel that it takes more than a concensus of 1 for me to consider something. this guy does seem to be more educated than the vendyl jones crowd in archeology, but still a bit on the fringe. maybe he'll get more attention, and provide a good set of evidence, because it is the people on the fringe that are needed to shift the paradiam.. (then they are visionary, rather than on the fringe).

A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood.	For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to jmake atonement for yourselves at the alter; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.

1	Well, I guess you can refuse to see something that's pretty obvious. It's up to you.	600? Oh really? Looks like the following scriptures are vague enough that they could apply to anything and nothing at the same time. Making vague enough comments can easily look prophetic. The fact that there aren't specifics is a key failure in your argument. If the bible was truly prophetic and scientifically accurate, terms that would easily be seen as represenativive of the natural force would be found everywhere, yet they are not. You are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is. Once again, anything vague enough can be taken for anything in any light under any condition.
1	don't you insult african americans!  i have posted a number of times links and comments by prominant black leaders who infact do support gay marriage. when will you stop your 'don't insult african americans' lies when you know all too well just how wrong you actually are?  oh that's right...never, because you just don't care what anyone thinks if it at all differs from your opinion.  weren't you spanked enough in the 'banned people' forum?	michele, that is a red herring and you know it.........don't insult african americans fight for rights with gay marriage.......

0	Actually, the more educated a person is, the less likely he is to be a creationist. Creationists tend to be semi-literate (poorly educated), rural, poor, and female.	The vast majority of proclamations and assumptions illustrating a cultural gap between science and Christianity, such as this post, are over emphasized and exaggerated as they focus on people who are expected to be out of touch (ie. People educated in the 40's and 50's when higher education was less common) or a very small percentage of Christians. Christians included in mass people of all academic backgrounds who find their paradigm consistent with their viewable (and non-observable) reality and by alienating them in mass by focusing on the minority of Christians you perpetuate falsehoods.
1	Well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.   Careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. Not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb!   You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.   So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.   Thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. Kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and MOST creationists use the KINDS thing as a support for their arguments.	i, as a creationist, do not believe in any of the five evolutionary theories: cosmic evolution: the origin of time, space, and matter, i.e. the big bang chemical evolution: the origin of higher elements from hydrogen stellar and planetary evolution: origin of stars and planets organic evolution: the origin of life macro-evolution: changing from one kind of animal into another there is a sixth evolutionary theory, but it has been proved in a controlled environment, and it is called micro-evolution (variations within kinds)
1	78.4 years? Well excuse me but I intend to live much longer than that. I was thinking about 112.7 years. Yeah. That's about right.	I am a Christian, so I believe that the meaning of life is to be re-acquainted with God and to live your life in according to his Word. Which, in my opinion is a far better life than: "I'm born of chance, I didn't ask to be here, I serve no purpose, so I might as well live egocentrically for the next 78.4 years until my life ends."

It was pretty predictable coming from you - personal attacks on creationists. I quoted YOU because of what YOU said.

0	Of course the bolshevik revolution was doomed from the start as Russia was not indsutrialised and the revolution was imposed by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat (not that there was a proletariat in Russia at the time).	Fortunately, the Bolshevik Revolution failed. 1989, the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down, along with Soviet Ideology.Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it.
0	Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes.	regardless, we have yet to see any evolution of new body parts or its so called "steps" if evolutionists want to suggest that a few decades is too little time
0	The 'teachings' either have no substance, or are certainly not original. Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God, and why this figure commands worship and obeisance.	Your attitude is wrong. Instead of using your mind and energies to disprove the bible you should use all your power to to learn how to obey the teachings of the Son of God and mature emotionally and in wisdom.

0	Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.	Pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not have been accomplished in any other way, is not "raising science on a pedestal"- it's merely reciting the obvious.
1	I don't recall seeing anyone who's for gay marriage come out truly in favor of the idea here that I recall. Can you? Naw, didn't think so. emoticonXSmilie	I think that's exactly why the anti-gay marriage crowd would never go for that idea. That is part of the reason that you see PRO-GAY proponents typically bring up this idea, and the anti-gay opponents typically remain silent.
1	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.	So, you don't judge! Then it's okay to lump all Christians together! Evidently, that makes it all better! So much for being a free-thinker. But then again, you never addressed the issue I asked you about slavery. You claimed to be moral, based on democratic ideals of moarlity... but democracy would have very likely continued slavery in the USA! It was Christians who aimed higher. I'm sorry if you want to talk past that, and say I disgust you.
0	You blame others for your failure to understand the basics.	Over the years these “educated” people through the media as journalist and movie/television writers began sharing their preliminary understanding of evolution as indisputable fact.
0	This is poor example. Focusing on saving lives over burying the dead doesn't do anything to trump personal autonomy.	If you say there is no such thing as a hierarchy of rights, or if you say the right to personal autonomy trumps the right to life, I point you to observe the situation in New Orleans. The relief efforts are concerned 1st with saving the living and 2nd with burying the dead.
1	oh yeah? tell that to the next person you see running down the street wielding a knife. ;)	it is within a mans power to control his emotions this in essence is rationality.
1	Me thinks thou dost be too kind. Yon creature willst make the false charge in any event. emoticonXKill	Well yes, Sarge but at the same time Accipiter indicated that we were preventing Accipiter and maybe others from having their opinions heard. I was just giving Accipiter his First Amendment Due. We all the time, get treated like we are the enemy, and we don't pay that any attention, because maybe to them, we are. However, it seems to me that when we treat them with the exact same treatment as they treat us, they cry foul! Is it a False claim of trying to claim aggrieved status? I think so, but I don't want to take the chance that Accipiter actually feels that way.So now Accipiter has an opening!
0	Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce.	I'm against gay marriage and have been happily married for 31 years, thereby disproving your BS. NEXT!!!
1	i love it when you bash people for stating opinions and no facts when you turn around and the same thing...i take it you have proof of a lie (keep in mind that lying is not the same as being wrong). as for hagel...i will assume he is actually in iraq right now and wrote that. give me a break emoticonxrolleyes	but then the bush people never saw a lie that they couldn't embrace.
1	The first Christians were Jews. Anyone who claims to be a Christian but hates Jews is a XXXXX. An anti-Semetic Christian is like an oxymoron term. And an Aryan is supposed to be someone with blue-eyes, brown-hair, and light-skin. You don't have to believe in 'Aryanism' to be Aryan, and the mortal enemies of Aryans are not Jews. 'Aryans' may hate Jews, but most Jews aren't bigoted. By the way, Hitler did not like just Jews but others he considered 'inferior' to the 'superior' 'Aryan race.'   Do some actual research instead of pulling XXXX out of the air to conform to your screwed up opinions.	aryan was more than, as you put it, "just white"... and as a religion, the mortal enemy of the aryans are jews... you had to be a christian and hitler hated catholics... guess PROTESTANT is the only one left.
0	i'm pro-choice because when i get pregnant, i want to chose whether or not i will abort it. i am not pro-abortion because i don't want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro-life, because i don't want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-abortion, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all have abortions'' you on the other hand go on and say ''hey let's give all fetuses life'' that's what makes you pro-life. i don't want abortion. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal. don't change the title, i just want people to know that we are called pro-choicers.	but you are for abortion in certain cases right? i am only talking to the pro abortionists. if you believe abortion should be allowed you are technically for it. if you are pro choice that implies that you are for the allowance of abortions. if it means this much to you i will change the debate title.
1	So your answer to the question then is "Nothing", Marc?	Well let's see, from your "EvC Forum" link;You gather information from other forums, then use it as bait on yet another forum? Exactly how many forums do you belong to? I would hope you wouldn't be too surprised that others sometimes ignore you.  Is this your main activity in life?
1	if homosexuals don't think, how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators? the fact is, the more homosexuality there is, the less abortions. if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man-wife would never abort once. are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas?	i see you missed the point again! youre not exactly a very bright person are you? by the way you forgot to mention: think, behave morally, and have concern for the future.
0	I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!	I don't think the lightning strike will be proven it is merely plausibe.
0	True, but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it. I know many christians who believe in god, and jesus etc, but think the bible is completely false, and is only a book of fables. Thats what i was trying to imply.	There's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if I analyze it, it will help make my point;The word "evolution" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often DOES mean. If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have. So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that "evolution" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution "with an open mind", and an ACLU lawsuit ensued. Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started. It's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Maybe government could be neutral, if it was small. The U.S. government is no longer small. Do the Christians that you know that believe in evolution, believe that there was no first man named Adam, or that there was no Genesis flood? The term "evolution" needs to be narrowed down - more clearly defined, for these discussions.

1	Are you sure? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida. His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida. If he is retired, he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs. Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time. Somehow 2 tours turned into 4, midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor.   All in all, VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying, lack of education and reading comphrension problems.	Voice of Reason? Hmm…He used to be in Military Intelligence hence the debacle in Vietnam. He probably still thinks that the US won the war.
0	i'm not surprised you would say this. it is the statement of a person who would want power and control over a woman's womb, which, btw, inoygdb.	i'd argue that the woman wants to control who lives or dies. that's scarier to me. emoticonxrolleyes

0	And if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black Americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well. I can't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open...it has to be expected. People have strong feelings about abortion rights (just like racism) and it is naive to think something like this wasn't going to happen.	I think it might show the true character of some people... I may disagree with you and others but I won't go spray painting your house or tearing down any ad you put up. Whatever happened to respect for others? This applies to pro-life and pro-choice by the way.
0	Sounds like the Brady Law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns.	According to this year's FBI Uniform Crime Report, the use of guns in crime rose significantly from 1985 to 1993. However, since implementation of the Brady Law in February 1994, there has been a significant drop in the percentage of violent crimes committed with a firearm. A study by The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence showed that, since it's enactment, the Brady Law background check kept handguns out of the hands of over 312,000 prohibited purchasers - including 113 felons a day.http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/r...h/bradyred.asp
1	So? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman's uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds.	“However the Bible does say "I create you before I placed you in the womb"...this would imply that God created you before you are even conceived.”
0	demon, that was quick were you right there? no resentment in my heart friend. i try to translate an expression from hungarian (again i guess that will be poor but i try anyway) 'friendship remains' (or 'unchanged' may be the better word?)  now here is what you asked:  that is a very good question demon, but i would put one more word there 'who'. no insult intended.	i am offering any of you creationists, christians, etc, the chance to prove me wrong. of course, to have this chance, you must also accept that i have full ability to argue with you. i used to be a christian, but after extensive studying and questioning, threw it away. do not talk to me unless you have a somewhat open mind to argue things. my aim is pikeman852003 my icq is 117686925 my msn is pikeman85@hotmail.com if you want to argue with me, add me. i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of. i have convinced several people to severly question or even give up their faith using reasoning and facts. argue with me at your own risk. i originally posted this on the old forums, then learned they were obsolete.
0	Well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue.	According to the Old Testament, Sodom and Gammorah were destroyed because the rich oppressed the poor (which is nearly an essential part of Capitalism), not because of homosexuality. According to the Old Testament, you must also murder people of different faiths in cold blood by stoning them to death, especially your friends and family.
0	that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about.	the people's interest trumps your right to privacy when a warrant is issued. a nics check addresses the 'with no knowledge' part of your scenario. this is what i support. ca law already.
1	Ok if we can not use guns. Can we use baseball bats? Is that OK with you?	emoticonXLove Indeed, you need guns to protect your free society; of democratic ideals. So, if anyone actually takes you up on your offer, and expresses and idea, then, they better watch out if it doesn't agree with yours!That makes sense. You need guns to protect yourself from people like you!
0	And I'm going to correct you again. The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view. More than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations.	True, but as Lurch corrected me before: It is the theory of evolution.
0	Those abortions that are perpetrated as "birth control" should be outlawed.	Won't work. "danger to the mother's life" has to cover allowing an abortion if there is a significant risk of psychological damage which might lead to suicide. Any doctor, especially in a country like yours with a runaway litigation culture, faced with "I will kill myself and the baby if you don't abort" will decide there is a significant risk (to his wallet mainly). It is for this reason that "convenience abortions" are technically illegal here in the UK, but they occur anyway.
1	lol. says the one who did not even bother to open the specific post link.  huh. again, you don't care about evidence. i gave it to you and you said i never did despite the link to the specific post right there.  liar you call me? well, i guess it takes one to know one.  questionable. all that the author did was state that the evidence rejects yec. he does not argue for another form of creationism.  please stop trying to argue there is only one form of creationism.  my god you are dishonest. still avoiding why arch would replace yec with christanity eh?  apparently you think interchangeability means that the words mean two different things despite being used interchangeably as the same.	well it seems that you basically lie, if you want to come to that basic conclusion. your link went to the second page of a thread. i requested a quote and a post # for the yec = christianity claim. you failed to provide that on this thread. you did not provide 6 different posts. you really do show a lot of arrogance and subjectivity that because you view 6 different posts as being evidence of something, that that makes it automatically true. you're basically saying that your spin is the truth and anyone who doesn't see things the way you do is dishonest. a perspective that is both arrogant and foolish. actually if you read the link you posted, you will see that the author is not just a christian who is neutral on yec, but he tends to favor creationism.

We don't have the funds for Medicare, Medicaide or Social Security either.But, why am I even hopeful that you will take any of that into consideration. You don't seem to have the aptitude for it.
0	Right. And that is the reason for peer review. Creationists don't subject their ramblings to peer review. That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists. Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation.	People have raised scientists to undeserved heights. It is clear that scientists can affect their experiments and observations, even in spite of their best efforts.
0	Because you know the peer review process is biased. Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read. The scientific community's problems are just that big.	Why do I think they are popular books, and not peer reviewed scientific articles?
1	not to me, but let's not quibble about things we can't change. let's talk about something that we can change...for a change. we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that's written. how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in 'special' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals won't bounce us off the walls.	you could go there but it won't change the fact i don't agree with your ideas of what is says. you believe it is saying one thing and i believe it says something else. we have an entire supreme court to do the same sort of interpretation game with our constitution. they sit and make decisions and interpreations based on what they think it says. the bible is the same game.

0	Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.	I disagree. Well maybe technically. Let's look at it this way.

0	i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!	i'm not going to argue with you if he does or doesn't. you'll have to take that up with some of the people in the gay rights movement. my point is that many people who have fought for human rights claim religion as part of their inspiration, and with your all-or-nothing approach, i can only assume you'd still condemn religion even if gets more and more gay friendly. so i find it odd you'd even bother to indicate any distinction.

0	I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.	I wasn't oversimplifying anything, only stating the obvious in that a whack job intent on murdering people can do it very effectively without a gun. But by disarming honest people as you would do, you insure that criminals who have no respect for the law will remain the only people armed in our society once the law abiding people willingly give theirs up. That will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but can't prevent crime from occurring as it's happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings.You anti-second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men. If you look at the rates of violent crimes in nations with stricter gun laws you will see that on a per capita basis violent crimes are just as high as they are here. It's just that more people die from stabbings and beatings than do here. But when all is said and done, dead is dead is dead. emoticonXBanghead

Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief.	And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples' lives as well? What? you don't do that? Bull. You can't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does. But by your logic, that would be imposing on them.Sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt. Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.

0	ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works(2:10). i must admit that im not totally sure what this means, that faith leads to good works? id dispute that. whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith, romans 2:6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds. in the end, the point is moot. i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone (and it doesnt conclusively), my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway.	wrong again, christianity is definately exclusive (john 14:6) jesus did say 'come' but it must be on his terms (repentance)
0	So the initial murder wasn't enough to show "that they are willing to commit acts of violence"? This makes absolutely no sense.	You should also note that the one scenario I think the death penalty is acceptable for is if they try to escape using violence or if they attack another prisoner. This has shown that they are willing to commit acts of violence and frankly have nothing to lose.
0	No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.	with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species wouldn't the old species not exist any more?

0	Well, if they've re-established control in New Orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. If they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (I'm very pro-2nd Amendment, so don't get me wrong here. I'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)I also think that it's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in--just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt. for NOT sending in the military. Now people are criticizing them for doing it???	I personally am astounded at the overreaction of the government in response to a handfull of shootings in NO. Sending in the army in full force, confiscating guns and talking about an 'insurgency' just because of a couple of crackpots have been firing their guns.On an average day in New York there are 10 times as many reports of shootings, yet I don't see such a massive military response over there...

0	So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.	"Even semiautomatic assault weapons can be fired with extraordinary speed.

0	Would you mind telling us just how he determined ALL maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements? To me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so! After all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence! Your claim would seem to be impossible, but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so.	He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.
0	does the grand canyon strike you as a 'crack' as well? like? what makes them so dangerous if it ain't their guns and their willingness to use them?  this assumes that no da is presently going after them. something i highly doubt.  diversionary tactic on your part. wouldn't making guns harder for them to acquire be helpful?	always a case that slips through the cracks... well how about we focus on the genuine problem instead of making something else into a problem. instead of playing the game 'what new law can we pass now' let's do something to focus on the one million dangerous gang members we've got running around free. they've been linked to 80% of the crimes committed in the country, there's no justified excuse for not going after them.

0	Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars.	See the comments section on the blog entry I linked to, particuarly Stuart's own comments ..."Yes, you registered online, but the initial invitation was by invite only. You registered who was coming in your invited group, not just “first come, first serve.”There's a lot of discussion there on that issue. But it really doesn't matter--a private screening of a film is a private screening--they can boot anyone out that they want. I didn't say anything about anyone 'breaking the law.' I'm just showing you a different perspective of the events from a witness--you know, giving you MORE information from which to draw conclusions. Or did you only WANT your information limited to one version of the story, mainly from the account of the one who got booted?? I think it was simply a private screening, and the people running the private screening didn't want them there. That's their prerogative, as it was obviously a private screening and that's the way it works. Again, read the comments on the blog I linked to as they include comments from people who were there, including more from Stuart and at least one by PZ Myers himself.

0	Origins of science, whether truly started by those of faith or not, is irrelevant. Whatever science was, it has become a body of knowledge, through application of reason.	‘The philosophy of experimental science…began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation… It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.'

"Researchers from Knox College find that male college students who held a gun rather than a child's toy for 15 minutes had elevated levels of testosterone and added three times as much hot sauce to a glass of water that another test subject subsequently had to drink."Richard Morin - Perfect 10s and the Odds of a Pink Nursery - washingtonpost.com" 'The finger pulls the trigger,' says Leonard Berkowitz, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin. 'But the trigger may also pull the finger. It's not just that having a gun is a convenient way of settling an argument. The weapon itself is a stimulant to violence.'"Berkowitz has studied the 'weapons effect' for more than 40 years. 'There's no dispute,' he says. 'Even the sight of guns, which people think of as objects that can hurt others, can induce aggressive ideas. A weapon can function as a conditioned stimulus, eliciting both the thoughts and motor responses associated with its use.' "WHY GUNS SHARE THE BLAME - TIME
1	like i said in another thread, the argument i hear most often from so-called 'pro-choicers' is that you cannot legislate morality. well then what can you legislate? every law in existence is legislation of morality! by that way of thinking, then we should have no laws. if someone kidnaps and murders your 3-year-old child, then let's hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality!	what do you see as the major flaw of the view opposite of your in regards to how abortion should be dealt with?

0	even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo.	governmental funding is not available (to my knowledge) without some (if not total) government control of the program. if there's any sure way to install inefficiency in a program, it is to let the government run it. i favor privatization, allowing those who want the program to fund and control it, those who don't to decline. donations would be tax deductible.

Or, if their families had money. went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries.Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services.	Not only that, to suggest that untold numbers of women would seek illegal abortions is a question-begging claim that has no grounding in history, logic, or reason. It is an unfounded, unproven claim. It is a betrayal to sound judgment to make decisions based upon unfounded predictions into the future.

Still, some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language.

0	Maybe you are having trouble with the concept of "low premium, high deductible". That means the monthly payments (premiums) are low, and the deductible is higher (cost you actually pay for services). This shouldn't be a problem. How often do you actually use your health insurance? I use mine very rarely (not at all in the last year). It appears that what Bush is trying to do is get insurance coverage to low income folks without a multi trillion dollar price tag (like kerrys plan carries). This isn't a bad thing, and I am not even a bush supporter.	nslation: the government will tell the citizens what kind of bank account they need to get to save up for their own health costs -- then pay it yourself. We constantly hear that a major reason for the increase in health care costs is the cost of the uninsured. How does it help it tell low-income/unemployed/minimum wage workers to save their money? Once again, businesses will love this. Don't offer health insurance to employees - they're self insured. Or they can get it themselves through their church!?!?

First of all we don't know if a soul even exist, and secondly, even if we had proof that it did, we have no way of knowing when it becomes reality for that person. Maybe it's like sin, you know, a man-made concept ;) You want to consider a ZEF a 'person' - fine, let's apply this so-called 'logic' across the board. If a woman should for whatever reason die while giving birth, then the baby should serve a life prison sentence for murder emoticonXGood Have a nice day emoticonXAngel
0	i have a reputation to maintain. most people stay on this site for about a year. i've been here for almost 3 years now? i guess you haven't learned that you shouldn't try to teach a pig to dance. nor have you learned that you shouldn't wrestle with a pig. you can't win and the pig likes it ;)	then why you keep reponding, i mean i would have stopped posting to you along time ago if you had, so why continue if what i say isnt worth reading

1	Somewhere in the middle? I always though it was solidly to the Right. :p	LOL. You are quick as a whip. :pJP and I have been around and around on this point a hundred times, we both know where the other stands (and the truth is somewhere in the middle :p ). It was an attempt at humour between the two of us rather than diving back into the same old argument that is completely off topic to the thread.
0	oh yeah! i remember tulip. calvinism seems to be more realistic, as it's more correctly grounded in man's sinful nature.	calvinism: total depravity unconditional election limited atonement irresistible grace perseverance of the saints arminianism: humans free will conditional election universal atonement resistible grace fall from grace
0	Honestly I'm not sure if it was ever said in the Bible, but I sure have heard a lot of the Bible thumpers saying free will is a gift from God.	Can someone tell me when God ever said that you have free will?
0	No, there isn't a consensus among Christians, at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing. There is no consensus about method.	2. What about consensus is proof? Is there not a consensus among Christians concerning creationism? Does that make it a fact?
0	It can go both ways. We all doubt. It is what you do with it that matters.[QUOTE=gnojek]If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort?Is faith some innate human tendency?It could be seeing as how there is the "god spot" in the brain, but maybe the god spot wouldn't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural.QUOTE]Look around. Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air. It is obviously part of our psyche. Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith. Even on different sides of the planet.It's as natural as the sun rising.	But why do you think that doubt limits people's ideas?If anything it helps to expand them.
0	It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft.Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i don't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves(a basic human right) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours.Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since?	You liked to David Icke - the guy who beleives that Giant Lizards are secretly running the world today...you need to take this with a pinch of salt.Anyway, I honestly don't really see a problem with salvaging things from the dead that are going to benefit the rest of mankind. It sounds icky, and is to a degree but seems better than feeding them to maggots or just burning them.Fair enough if you want have it as an option like Organ Donors but seems the same thing really to me, especially as there are babies that die because they need immediate organ or tissue donors after being born.Its the allegations of babies being killed to fund this I doubt, seems to be an attempt to sensationalise a piece of news. I stand by the original point that there isn't really a medical use for fetus skin as was claimed, some of the organs might be of more use but thats about it.
1	You're equating atheism and homosexuality with terrorism and drug dealing? Really? Can you stop being a reactionary dolt long enough to convince me you're worth even trying to converse with? If not, I'll understand... and not be surprised.	Well if they're gonna be shelling out that shellac on a shingle for atheists, homosexuals, pedophiles, abortionists, special interest groups, terrorists, pornographers, business owners, prostitutes, drug dealers, illegal immigrants, dictators, the Untied Nations, and ACORN...then is it really too much to ask them to extend the same courtesy to people who actually believe in the Constitution?
1	No - but they certainly have a bias. As do we all.	You are not implying that Catholics shouldn't have the right to use the media to put forth ideas on politics, culture, and society are you?
0	Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion. In typical fashion you make claims which you don't support at all. Here is my post below, point out WITH EVIDENCE!!! what I am distorting in any way; especially that which I hold dear. In other words, write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack. emoticonXDonno	This is why religion may not survive the future.People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.The only hope is if the nuts stop making it in to an adversarial situation.Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, but that is already clear to anyone who knows his work here.
0	Well, the question I am asking is for you to provide a valid scientific prediction based on creationism.	I think you, The Barbarian, and Close_slave_can are basically asking the same question. The problem is, you are all trying to look at these predictions through the lense of the evolutionary paradigm.
1	isn't that amazing that you were the fool all along? oh wait, you are to simple-minded to understand that. carry on.	please do not try to win (win their souls for god) the atheists. the bible says 'the fool has said in his heart, there is no god' (psalms 14:1). better you debate with people of understanding. again the bible says that, 'fools only pleases to express his own ideas, he is not ready to accept the valid things'
1	I am un-aware of a conservative nazi party. Did Howard Dean tell you this?	I don't hate the man personally, I do hate what he stands for and I hate his actions. As for america I love my country thats why I am so angry that my country is being hyjacked by conservate nazis.
1	wow, you have a g.e.d. what happened? dropped out of high school? or did you flunk out? judging by you sentences (if you can call them that), you flunked out. and as for me, i have a computer engineering associates degree and i'm working towards my bachelors of science in computer engineering, so keep that in mind. i suppose the 'really important things' that you are learning that aren't reading and writing is how to roll a joint or take lsd since i couldn't imagine what a person who still lives in his mom's basement learns.	i'm ignorant how? lol well let me tell u how it works were i'm from in california people fight with each for the opportunity to stab rapists yea i'm not to good at sentences or spelling i spent time learning more important things i have never needed spelling or how to write anything really important to b honest but i do have a g.e.d lol let me guess why ur mad becuase u still live with ur mom
1	i have no reason to believe it's false, and reason to believe it is true. relax ladies and gentlemen, that test of the find-a-cook system passed with flying colours. you're having trouble understanding english again, maybe you should hire a translator? if it is not a crime then it cannot be an accusation, and is likely a fact.	dispatchers have no duty to protect you either, neither do the cops. neither are qualified to give legal advice either. their opinion is just that. an opinion .
0	We cannot prove the existence of God for, by definition, he dwells in a reality outside our own. Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace, nor can I disprove it, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists, by definition, in Hyperspace.I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe. A round square, a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously, you name it.	I have to disagree with 1 and 3. If God exists, and he wanted his existence proven, he could prove it. Likewise, if he wanted to have an impact, he could. I will agree with 1 and 3 if you add "as things stand now", or words to that effect.
0	Intelligent design comes in many flavors too.ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?	What about other 'rational' alternatives to your version of evolution; such as that postulated by ID theorists?
1	i find it funny you think article v was repealed yet the bill of rights references article v for passage.  so we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but article v which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? you've really lost it haven't you. what do you mean 'sos' by the way? save our ship haha? i have been saving your ship.	yep i did say that and you don't know why? if you can repeal the bor, any one of them there is nothing to stop you from repealing the articles either is there? in fact, you have made that claim repeatedly. i said you couldn't and supplied the reasons. you sos again?

0	A lot of work has been done on that topic. I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book, but it is definitely worth the read.	5) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design?
1	Explain that one to the thread starter. He claims he is the victim of age discrimination when he states "I am a person 15 years of age and I want my gun, yet I can't get one. Why not?"	Where's the smileys? This is a joke, right?My sons have owned their own guns since they were 11 years old. Of course I bought them, but I bought their shoes, too.Maybe my mind ain't right on this one. emoticonXFrazzled
1	you mean pascals sucker bet? if arch is wrong, he's wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood, a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their 'flocks'. he's prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured.  furthermore, he's extolling others to do so also. because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold, they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude.	this seems to be a mixture of pascal's wager and shocking evidence of eternal cruelty and torture from the god of love. pray tell, arch, what is meant by 'the second death'? will you confirm or deny that symbolic fire means eternal destruction, not eternal torment? can you provide scriptures that confirm that the ungodly will be tortured for eternity in indestructible bodies? why would a god of love torture people for eternity? why would you want to worship such an evil creature if that was the case?
0	oh yeah, i forgot that you believe that the corporate media and corporate leaders have gotten together to create war and put innocents in jail. i will admit that the powers of the executive branch have gone way too far, but i still believe that being at war means we have to treat the enemy like our enemy, and not like american civilians. do i agree with the war? no. but that's only because i feel that we could have done this all with special forces and not with an invasion/occupation. i would still support detaining terrorists captured in battle/mission (and if they're americans, give them a proper trial, not a military tribunal or some bullshit like that).	i found this by chance and really couldn't resist replying: 'these are people captured on the battlefield.' please define whjat is measnt by battlefield exactly, my understanding is that battlefield = anywhere on earth 'many of the ones released have been either recaptured or shot in combat' sorry i don't beleive your corporate controlled bullshit media. 'because they're terrorists!' all i have to say to this revolting excercise in hypocrisy is the following: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4pgpbqfxgo  'this is war people, you have to start entering the reality of the situation.' really, oh well when you put it that way, actually just out of curiosity who are you fighting against, oh yeah, a tactic called terrorism which you use more than any other nation on earth. your true colours are on display for all to see, good day:0
1	Oh come on. If those words were hateful, then you need to 'investigate' probably millions of people, because those are pretty normal sentiments. Canada must have a LOT of tax dollars. I don't entirely agree with what he said either, but I think it's downright scary that your govt. investigates something like that.	The law applies equally to everyone. Religious people cannot discriminate outside of a church, as the printer tried to do. Bishop Henry's comments were indeed hateful, not religious. There are laws against willful promotion of hatred. This type of speech has legal limits. This does not mean all hate speech will be illegal, only that there are limits. I suppose you thought his comments about the state using it's coersive power against gays, was very Christian? Would it not be more Nazi?
1	You mean you're for real? You're not setting out deliberately to make creationists look as if they don't know what they're talking about? Because that's all you're achieving.  Still no source for the trillions, I see.	ya try again.. im 18 and still in high school.. wanna try again with that scientist bit?
0	What we have here is simply a perspective problem, which is the problem with most debates. I see the Bible as sound, and every "error" in the Bible I have researched (I have admittedly not researched them all) have been refuted.	I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal. What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be. However, I believe it is necessary to eliminate the Bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away. Then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago.
0	So everyone thinks that "evolutionists" should seize power or something? If that is true, it is because evolution is very widely accepted.	The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless.
0	i guess this disease is 'contagious' thus due to this contagious disease it can spread rapidly. if he dies then no one gets infected and vice versa. although, i believe that if that is the situation i don't the infected persons opinion matters. if you possibly may kill even 1 person you will probably be isolated from social world and be taken to a place where you have no contact with the public no questions asked.	can you please share how the 4000+ are spared? i think it would make a difference!
0	Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.	We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution,
0	And what if it is one to me? Then your refute is equally refuted. The support for us not knowing lies in you and other's inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person. Your own inability is my support.	I tell you now, a fetus is not morally a person to me. There, you are refuted.
0	The comic relief doesn't even recognize it has passed in on, or attempted to!	I don't know, yours is overwhelming, who gave it to you?
0	Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events.	What is supposed to take thousnds/ millions of years for populations of animals to evolve has just taken a swift punch to the gut by David Reznick.

0	You misunderstand me I believe they should all be locked up. Anyone who preaches against gay people freely living their lives as equal citizens with all the rights and responsibilites should be locked up in the darkest dungeon. There can be no compromise on this issue peoples lives are at stake.	By far most speech about homosexuality from those who don't approve is not hate speech. You've been listening to too much propaganda from gay lobby groups who think demonizing and working toward persecuting Christians for their beliefs is the best means to an end. If Canada limited it's persecution only to those who are trying to change the law, there wouldn't be a problem.
0	I don't know if you ever heard of the UK Poll Tax but I could have seen myself protesting by non-payment against such a grotesquely unfair system of taxation had I been of the age to do so.	CASE 2: What about if you disagreed with how much the government is taxing you. Lets say your tax rate is 25% but you thought that was too much, would you just pay the amount you felt was fair?
0	Bellesiles claimed his data was destroyed in a flood. Lott claimed his data was destroyed in a computer crash. Some people have been calling John Lott "the Bellesiles of the Right." Read this article "The Bellesiles of the Right? Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data."http://slate.msn.com/id/2078084/John Lott has already admitted to inventing a fan (Mary Rosh) to praise himself. That's intentionally trying to deceive people. http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp...&notFound=true	So do Ludwig and Cook. One problem, they really could not find anything wrong with it. They only "THINK" someting is wrong with it. There maybe something wrong with it, but "thinking someting is wrong" and actually being wrong are two different things.Bellesiles is most definately a liar and there is no debate or confusion about it.
1	Ha, that is just an idiotic perspective. We'd have no laws (and many important ones) if you can't make a bill that doesn't affect you. Sorry Civil Rights legislation!	An independant perspective doesn't make it a good thing. Politicians that propose anti-gun legislation don't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect, they shouldn't be allowed to propose it.
0	What would you know about fair and balanced?emoticonXCensoredI know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?	Funny how the truth so often tends to have an anti-Christian bias.If you can find something untrue in the article, point it out and proffer your evidence; otherwise... I didn't think posters were required to "balance" their opinions here.At least now we see what passes for "moderation" on this board. (That's right, folks: you can't put JPS on your ignore lists, 'cuz he's a "moderator." You know, like Glen Beck on "fair and balanced" Fox News.)
0	Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim, that can be refuted through logic, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct.This new claim is an interesting one that I have seen others use. I'll tell you on what basis. Based on reason. To hold that nothing can be known for certain, is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense. I'll start a thread about this claim, it's a hot topic to be sure!	Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?
0	Working on it. Apparently we are still waiting for to to be graded (it was really big, at leat 20 typed pages). I plan on buying from them when they get it back, and maybe putting up a whole page in honor of it.

1	It appears that peddler is finally open to learning new things! (Unless, of course, peddler is simply being facetious... which is not obvious from the immediate context.)	I did not know that. Facinating!
0	your probably referring to the mexican basin crater. mass extinction doesn't prove evolution. the flood as described in the Bible is an example of mass extinction. besides, in order for the asteroid theory to work, the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning. also similiar to the effects of the flood.	The only difference is that the evolutionists are correct. BTW, they've found the crater which was made by the asteroid. The mass extinction is a fact and so is evolution.

0	I think a free society works better by saying "You have to have at least a certain variety to give your customers a choice in products". Businesses should have the restrictions, not private citizens.	A free society works by saying "you can't do this stuff but everything else is up to you guys". If you go around saying "you must do it this way" then you really aren't a free society but you have the government controlling instead.
0	Can we get away from quoting 5 year old posts? Seriously, if you don't take the time to actually read the thread why should I respond to your post?	I wouldn't say one can't be a Christian if they support abortion but I find it really hard to understand how one justifies or rectifies it with the Bible or their faith. Ultimately their are responsible to God for what they believe and how they advise others on what to do in a situation based on that belief. I know that one of the things God HATES and there aren't many things mentioned in the bible that He hates, one of the things is the shedding of innocent blood. If God HATES such a thing then I certainly do not want to support it. I don't know what could be more innocent than an unborn child. I did a bit of research on abortion & the bible a few years ago, here is a collection of what I found - Abortion & The Bible
0	Actually, I've heard it all before and it is wrong. The article is full of misinformation and misrepresentation. It is, as you say, slanted rather than an honest report of the data.	Not that anyone here cares to read the Creationist slant on soft tissue found in dinosaurs...but here it is
1	You really are an idiot if you think China follows Jefferson	so then what did Greece and Rome contribute except what not to do????? Jefferson used all of human history as an example of what not to do. So far so good!! The planet is united except for liberalism.then who, why be so afraid?they will half half our percapita income in a generation at current pace. But even if the became purely Jeffersonian and did pass us we will always be the Father of freedom and liberty. before Jefferson that was true.so great they followed Mao to 60 million dead, and now they follow Jefferson. Does the genius ever wonder why there is nothing in their past to follow?
1	Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis.	As I have mentioned many times in these forums, one's personal view of abortion (i.e., whether it should be prohibited or permitted) has nothing whatsoever to do with whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned. If one supports the rule of law, then they would have to support the statement made by Senator McCain. Also, given that you don't like his stated position on gay marriage (i.e., that marriage is a state issue), it appears to me that you don't like democracy either.
1	Right, expect when talking about the 14th amendment. The way you guys like to define "equal protection" would make it so any restriction is unequal.	I'm not disguising one thing. I am always clear that my argument is equal marriage for same sex couples. No one I know on my side argues simply for "equality in marriage", period full stop.
0	I think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited. Space, time, energy, matter and laws all came into existence together. Of course that's impossible for us to envisage....	the problem then is, how could the universe begin in the midst of absolutely nothing (no time, no matter, no space, no energy)? what could possibly trigger the universe's beginning? (and then of course, where did these triggering events come from?)you will end up at negative infinity at some point
0	And it is. The ToE is a theory, however. It explains evolution, which has been observed. Do not attempt to deny that.	Evolutionists, in an attempt to win converts, have a habit of saying evolution is a fact.
1	You said there wasn't a pro-choice group before Roe v Wade. However I would have to do my research to dig up a group in 1850. Hold on...	show me the pro-choice group from 1850 please.
1	Yeah guess that probably makes me a gun-toten redneck drunk,shooten everything in sight huh.emoticonXKillemoticonXGood	He probably doesn't make a distinction in that. He will count drinking and gun owning as doing both at the same time, kinda like winnie the mute did.
0	Actually, everything the bible say's belies your "atheist answer". The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident. It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior, but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life.	Atheist answer: its relgious PEOPLE that expect us to believe in God. God himself doesn't have any kind of expectations. Theist answer: the bible says that without faith its impossible to please God, and since the bible also says that the bible is God's true word, then we only need faith to believe the bible and by extension to believe in God.
0	On an internet forum why is that so important? The bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is, but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he isn't and adjust accordingly.My guess is this is not the only place this happens. These things happen, you fall, you get up, people laugh, you move on, you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up. Just depends on who you want to be.Sorry I am a sucker for empty milk crates. Can't seem to walk by one without jumping on and taking her for a spin.	I agree, but when you know your opponent will succeed in making you look weak if you give them the chance, trying to look like the bigger man will do Jack for you. I know I'm the bigger man, the only reason for publicly displaying my moral high roadedness on an Internet forum is to prove myself, but if I know my opponent will use it as leverage against me then there's really no point.

0	why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent.	<buzz>wrong, it's the conduct of both parties that need to be reigned in. and that starts with good parenting. for example, when you have a healthy marriage, children will generally model themselves after their parents (disclaimer note i said 'generally' there are exceptions, however disclaimer).

0	To say nothing of the possible threats to people's safety, if not actual acts of violence.	Heck, I'd be proud to have my name there, knowing I was doing the right thing. But I think you may be right; someone needs to report it. What I want to know is, why would they WANT to know where these people live? That's kind of scary.(Also, did you notice the obvious marketing appeal-to-sympathy tactics on the page he linked? The man with a baby implying it's his adopted son or something? I can hear the kid a few years from now: "Hey mom, did you know I was used by the gay lobby industry to lie to people and shamelessly solicit sympathy?" Good grief what a sham)
1	Maybe you aren't aware, but something that hasn't happend but has a possibility or probability of happening is potential, so the word is accurate to describe it. And since I'm sure Steeeeve (the dictionary worshipper) will step in, here is the definition:	But what you don't seem to get is that this will probably happen by default. It's not a matter of 'potential', it WILL happen in most cases unless outside intervention (killing it) takes place. That's beyond potential; that's the rule. An unfertilized egg cannot become a person; an embryo more than likely WILL unless something external kills it. You are inaccurately minimizing the difference there, IMO. One will likely "become a person", the other will absolutely not.
1	i do not understand how sexism, slavery and filicide fit into a being that is supposed to be infinitely moral. care to justify that for me? oh wait... you can't.	you can choose to have faith i whatever you want. some feel the bible represents the historical accounts of jesus. it could be mythical, magical or whatever. but, there are many who feel this is real and was produced to represent fact not fiction. you can choose to believe it or not. i don't think that the harry potter series was ever considered anything but fiction. and, i said i interpret it as i desire...not.others. yes, practices at the time condoned many of the things you state, but the bible was about jesus with many of the practices of the time added as historical color not relevant to the actual text itself.
0	well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort.	legislative solutions and popular appeal are not the same thing. the legislature is hired to do what's right, not what's popular. that aside, where has the gay rights movement used voting as anything except a measure of last resort? if gays knew they could count on popular support they wouldn't need to fight to get their rights protected. we know this. we also know that's there's lots of big money opposing gay rights, and sadly enough money is often the deciding factor in voting. so where is voting being used as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay rights movement?
0	This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.	In reality, there are no concrete 'reasons' for believing in God. If you believe in God, you believe based on faith. There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists... unless you first believe through faith that God exists.

1	Well if you already know you're for guns, then you should know the basic reasons, right? Or was this an uninformed decisions (I heard from my friend that guns are good)? But basically other people have said it. They're protected by the Constitution, they generally result in lower crime rates, and they can be used for defense as well as hunting. Oh, but the burden of proof isn't on the people supporting guns, but those who wish to ban guns. Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable.

0	No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed. It does not mean that "life is irreducibly complex" since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion. And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like "pieces that happen to be fitted together". More and more like a complex kludge. Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one!	It means life is holistic, not reductionist. Life, as is the genome, is a system -- an irreducibly complex system -- not an assortment of pieces that just happen to be fitted together over time via random genetic changes culled by nonrandom death.

1	I'd lo9ve to test your hypothesis sometime by dropping a few Democrats into a pack of wolves and seeing who survives. emoticonXSmilie	It depends on what you mean by "the wild". If you release a wolf in his natural enviroment and realese a democrat in his natural enviroment, I`m pretty sure the democrat will outlive the wolf. If you release a wolf in the democrats enviroment, the wolf will die rather quickly. If you release a democrat in the wolves enviroment, he stands a decent chance of outliving the wolf (he merely needs to get back into a town)

He had to have known that this was part of his duties as the laws currently stand.

0	Forgive me if this seems picky, but I just want to try and fully understand this argument. I should say that I don't necessarily agree with it, and would like to respond as to why. I just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that I can make a sound response.As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.... Where does this right originate from, i.e., is it from the US Constitution via the 14th amendment etc?	Sure.The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will....
0	surely, we can only 'guesstimate' how many living species have escaped our attention ? but how probable is it that only 1% of all the species that ever existed escaped extinction ?  i think your point about mass extinctions may be a key to what has puzzled me.	common sense. the number of living species that have escaped our attention cannot compare to those that have gone extinct over several billion years of life with numerous mass extinctions, remembering that fossils are rare.
0	Actually, the answer might depend more on the nature of the question, or the particular religious cult of the person being asked, etc. In questions of science, fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture.On the other hand, you are characterizing religion as insanity. I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science, then that is insane.	If I was to ask a religious person of a provable way that he found out about his belief he would have to say that he was told. If the person that told him was asked the same thing he would have to say the same answer. Now of course it can go back wards like that for ever, it has to go back to three “possible” beginnings: some one lied, some one was insane/delusional/ect, or there was divine intervention/ect.
1	That post is not only off topic, but yet a further example of your being completely out of touch with reality.	<Flush>People can speak well and be blooming imbeciles, like the left wing loons who think the right for individuals to bear arms is dangerous.What's dangerous are the liberal dweebs who are bankrupting the country with their cradle to grave entitlement programs to the point where we're going to have to start gutting our military just to pay the interest on the debt Obama is running up. Now the turkey wants another $1.2 trillion.That's why liberals are dangerous.
1	Yep, so much for a pastor knowing his sheep(le).  It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.  What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???  As to this case.  I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.  But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock.	if it is true that having a membership of over 2000 members means that you 'really have no idea who is walking through your doors,' then it's not an argument for armed guards; it's an argument against big crowds.

The fact that much of society views this issue differently than the issue of black people only underscores my point. There are lots of people who would and do give full support to civil rights, but not to issues of homosexuality.
0	I think that the type of weapon does make a difference. A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives.	You are FINALLY catching on. This is why we go to war against folks like Saddam regarding WMDs, or declare sanctions against Syria and Irans, but we do not go to war with the french or the british over WMD's. WMD's are inanimate objects, and we all know that inanimate objects are incapable of waging wars. We also know that instable governments and tyrannical leaders are fully capable of waging war, and have done so in the past.

0	I think you misunderstand my view. I think that a third-term fetus is already sufficiently a person, so I would CERTAINLY consider a newborn baby a person. To me, a person is one who has the most basic, rudimentary sense of thought and emotion. A late-term fetus, from my point of view, is no less a person than an Einstein. An Einstein, of course, is much more useful to a much greater number of people, but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person, I would say not.	A newborn baby cannot think mentally like an adult, but does that make him/her a less valuable life? if a woman is raped, and a two year old is raped, is it not an equally bad crime considering the two year old didn't understand what was happening?I have the same view on abortion.
0	wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions	What you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality? The definitions were accurate. It would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation. How about some evidence to support the "theory."By the way, I'm still waiting for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution has changed. What you really meant was the creationists had invented bogus definitions so that they could lump all of science under "evolution," wasn't it?

And there are certainly people here who also can't pass up the opportunity to show such hypocrisy with religious activists against gays, and I don't recall you opposing THEM on that.

0	So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated.

The Tec-9 was banned under President Clinton's semiautomatic weapon order some years ago and is no longer made, but the ones that are still out there can be legally sold."Gun Shows and ColumbineSame for North Hollywood. The weapons were legally bought at a gun show by an acquaintance and transfered to the shooters. The shooters then easily modified several to full-auto.
0	And here you reveal your prediliction for reading what you want to see into the words of others. I described materialism embracing new forces and phenomena which have withstood the rigors of the scientific method. I explicitly described science as a methodology, not a philosophy. You are wrong about me, WW, and the longer you pretend otherwise, the more time you're going to waste on strawmen and the more chances I'm going to get to make your arguments look silly. It's up to you. Argue with me, or argue with the person you want me to be.	Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.

I mean i understand if you do but I would like to make some points about it.....there are also some points procing creation.
1	That would be the fault of you rather than us. Everyone knows a small mind can't see what's beyond it's comprehension level.	maybe the ammo has gone to your brains and the lead has really affected you gun loonies, for there is no much sign of intelligence in any of you.
1	i love how the apple fan is illiterate. what exactly is the great thing that apple invented?	samsung produces apple clones for several years, they have ideas or concepts on they own. it's pathetic and unfair.
0	if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation (i,e., six days, man from dust, fruit of good and evil) then what is its use? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated, or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical? genesis 1&2, in the literal application, has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without: 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises. now if genesis has it wrong, then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible? from all scientific perspective, genesis 1&2 never happened, and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned.	do you define weight as numerical or some kind of rating system on who is the most important church father. what part of darwinian evolution does the church not agree with? that link also had the following quote. should modern science be able to prove without the shadow of a doubt that man evolved from amoeba, reptiles, animal life into what he is today, orthodox theology would be able to make the transitional acceptance far more readily than western theology for all the reasons stated above.
1	Hey, Jack, in case it missed your expert scrutiny, I'm first normally responding to some pro-gay argument that's referenced in a great many of those posts. There's scores of you guys defending such iniquity at any given time. Just look at the last twenty posts and it's five or more of you pro-gay pundits vs. one or two respondents. Seems to me it your cause to promote and defend, just like we're seeing across America. Make you guys a deal: You shut up about it and it will greatly please me to never mention it. I don't suppose you will ever do that now, will you? LOL!	Are you kidding? He's absolutely obsessed with the topic--and not just on this website. How hilarious! (For the record, in the 2+ years the poster in question has been on this site, he's posted more than any other user, even those who had several months head-start on him, the overwhelming majority of which are on the topic of homosexuality. And no, I didn't take the time to count them individually: just go to the members' list and sort by number of posts. You can also do a search by user name and forum, but the engine won't find more than 500 matching posts, and he's way over that on the Gay Rights forum alone. Talk about a definition of hypocrisy!)
1	Not only would I throw the switch, I'd pay the electric bill, too. emoticonXGood	George W. Bush is very anti-choice and pro-death penalty. He loves to pull the executioner's switch. See next post of Bush's mockery of Karla Faye Tucker.
1	If we did not have criminals, we wouldnt have "shoot outs" as you so call them.	So the solutions to gun violence proposed by gun activists in this thread seem to be-1) More prison time. 2) More guns and have more shootouts between the bad guys and good guys. Yet, in other developed nations that have much lower rates of gun violence there are a lot less gun owners and people in prison. So are gun activists trying to sell people snake oil? "More than 5.6 million Americans are in prison or have served time there, according to a new report by the Justice Department released Sunday. That's 1 in 37 adults living in the United States, the highest incarceration level in the world."http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0818/p02s01-usju.html

0	It's been reported in the Telegraph as well as several other news outlets. Want to slander them as well or do you want to try to disprove their story based on its content. I suggest the former, because the University has already confirmed the authenticity of the e-mails and documents. emoticonXRolleyes	Ah so, the extremely biased right wing rag owned by cult leader Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church cult which believes that Moon is the Christ.
1	How do you know if they WANT to believe in a deity? They simply don't.	Second, the majority of the world believes there is a god, and the others don't want to believe (hope there isn't) a god
0	In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.	You still haven't showed us where he is a self proclaimed Conservative Christian rather than just a conservative republican OP. Would you care to support that claim with actual evidence or is it your intent to once again just lump everyone on the Right into the same pot of Funamental Christianity so as to slander us all as a group ? Is that your idea of fair and honest debating ? Some might take lies about them as personal slanderous attacks on their character and respond in kind. I thought you believed in elevating the quality of debate to being intellectually honest ?
1	You forgot about the youth recruitment efforts as well. I am president of the local chapter of "Get 'Em While They're Young." Our mission (agenda, if you will) is to recruit and convert the kids in an effort to increase the prevalence of homosexuality to 20% by 2015, then 51% by mid-century when we will have total control, muahahahahaha!!!	There is nothing at all absurd about this take. The Gay agenda has been to normalize homosexuality and what better way to do it than to indoctrinate the young and desensitize them to the negatives of the lifestyle while they're still impressionable. That way they know that within 20 years they will have normalized this abnormal lifestyle.
0	oh yeah! i remember that one... abbynestor was going off on everyone, so i told to to calm down and then everyone (including the people she was ripping on) starting yelling and calling me a dick.  like honestly dana got called a bunch of nasty stuff, i try to defend her and she gets snappy with me...like what? that's why i'm going to stay away from that stuff now.	yeah and there was one debate that i had to stop because it was getting out of hand.
1	You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic? Talk about ABORTING.	poor boo-boo...You want to talk pain?I wish the pro-infanticide zealots could experience being dismembered and having their skulls collapsed and their brains sucked out so they'll know what an innocent baby feels when it's being aborted.
1	Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!	Okay, let's look at evolution.
1	I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.	The first reasonable alternative explanation is that it never happened as alleged. Prove it did, and we'll consider your present foundless belief a little more seriously.

0	The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved (even on the balance of probabilities) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith.	Where does one need faith, exactly, to make claims about evolution (hint: faith is not needed).
1	In the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt.	Even better were does it say that evolution is proven?
1	Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.	Actually no such right exists, for you or anybody else. Not in the US Constitution, not in the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
0	Not sure how you can tell that since very little is mentioned about his methods.	His method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability.
1	wow, this was up to 6 points at one time. down-voting it without a rebuttal surely refutes it.	given the following:  -there is no evidence for the existence of god. -there is no evidence against the existence of god. due to the fact that there are an infinite number of false premises, and only a limited number of true premises, it is better to err on the side of skepticism. this is why the burden of proof rests on the believers. until such time this burden of proof is satisfied, the logical position is the position of skepticism. i cannot say with absolute certainty that god does not exist, but i will live my life as if that were the case until proven otherwise.
0	Might be something to be said for that. Are there any studies that show possible causes of suicide?	...is that they think that ...they aren't loved...
0	Come on, people. You don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. There's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. And if no one else would have, I would have.	We aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child.
0	What basis do fundamental rights derive from? In other words, how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right?	No, anyone who denies one freedom is a slaver. If you think about it, slavery requires life.
0	I would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then. That is a new species, and it is not man doing it, but rather nature itself.	As theorized, the concept of evolution is analogous to slow morphing, rather than quick abrupt changes in a species. MORPHING!, as can be done with computer graphics programs designed by intelligent beings. Evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change -- but morphing is accomplished by unintelligent random processes, or at least that's how the story goes -- the created universe and life were random events. I have been patiently waiting for many years but to date have never seen or heard of any species morphing into another species. I am aware of genetic defects that limit species but unaware of mutations that perpetuate new species. Clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed, such as poodles and great danes, but they remain members of the same species.Mankind has thousands of years of written history and I am unaware of anyone observing species morphation(Is that a word?). Although it is approaching 200 years after Darwin hypothesised how species might have originated, we are no closer to observing a species morphing than Darwin. Humans attempt to create new species, such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers, but these "NEW" species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves. Besides observing it, the way to demonstrate evolution is to manipulate a species until it developes into a new species, but alas, then all you will have proven is directed efforts of intelligent beings create species. Hmm, wonder what intelligent being(s) created us?
0	like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized. http://kevinantoine.com/holytrinity.htm now why does that matter? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man. you have made absolutely no progress towards that end. do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility.	what do you care if i type it out or someone else does, as long as you get the information? and it was good information that was presented to you. but i guess you'll never know, will you? tsk tsk... this ought to be good.  tell me when you believe the trinity was 'invented,' and who invented it?  you need to start backing up your half-baked claims.
1	So what's your point, Bush is as Liberal as the most Liberal Senator in Congress?	Bush's first act as President was to hop in bed with Ted Kennedy and pass the NCLB Law. Then he attempted to appease the AARP by passing a $Trillion prescription Plan for whiteheads. If that isn't appeasing liberals and moderates, what is? emoticonXRolleyes
1	you really need to stop reading such biased, uninformed digital-age fishwrapper. i can think of at least one instance off the top of my head, justice alito's confirmation. the democrats threatened to filibuster bush's scotus choice. the gang of seven democrats agreed not to filibuster in return for the republicans not to use the 'nuclear option'. it was in all of the papers. i'm surprised that the leftwing rag missed it. emoticonxrolleyes	howard dean says kill the bill. a great ed show interview with arianna huffington viewable at this huffpost link.  also an interesting exchange afterwards with joan walsh and brad blakeman. as ed says to joan -- the key question she never answers while disagreeing with dean -- is when did the republicans ever need 60 votes under george bush? it's a shame, grasshopper, you don't read or view anything from sources you fundamentally disagree with (including the declaration of independence, i gather), so therefore you cannot discuss it. after all, you might have 7 years of bad luck. emoticonxrolleyes
0	No, it's often an emotional show. They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing. The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him. There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticonXWow	Were you hung-over? I can tear up to the most silly programes when hung-over. Heck, I once cried to a re-run of "XXXXX eye for a straight guy" (or something.. I`m not sure about name in english)... I was mighty hung-over though. Note that I`m not saying there is anything wrong with displaying emotions unless your drunk or hung-over, I cry even when I`m not hung-over I`ve just noticed this weird relationship between movies or tv-shows, crying and hang-overs.
1	Math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it.	This standard gets ever complicated. The 22wk old baby inside the mother has "less value" to you it seems. Actual location determines a value...someone else determines the value on someone. It really is confusing. I just don't understand how value it relative to other things....even more so when it comes to humans
0	should we clear up what we're talking about at all? i think adultery is legal in 24 states, and i'm pretty sure adultery laws have been pretty much completely unenforced since world war ii. i don't know of any states where a polygamous relationship with no marriage involved is illegal. now, certainly having multiple marriage licenses is illegal...	polgamy is against the law, living your life as a lesbian is not. that is why i said if i saw a polygamous marriage situation, i would contact the authorities, because in more cases than none; young women are being taken advantage of by someone much older; the tom green situation. but, the way your life is lived, i would protect to my last breath and continue to work for equality for one and all.
1	yes, it's david koresh's fault that the fbi burnt children alive, right? disgusting. however evil or deluded david koresh might have been, nothing he did compares to gassing and then setting on fire large numbers of children, an act you apparently applaud.	the fault is the cult's, not those that came to enforce the law and were met with gunfire.
1	Well if it's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades? And while you're at it, supply the names of the companies who're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions.	So easy to do in America, a nation which refuses to acknowledge the need for responsible gun ownership.
0	Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory. Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved.	Do not deceive yourself into thinking that "literal" Biblical Creation would be proved true if evolution were proven false. We would need a third theory.
0	Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again.	If abortion is made illegal I predict that you will see across the border abortion clinics, in canada and states that still premit abortion. Are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions? Prolifers better becare for what they wish for. Prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like taxes. They better get ready to pay, in taxes, for the extra prisons and social programs needed for all those abandoned children.
1	really? damn! i wanna be awesome too. are you selling awesomeness or do i have to develop it on my own? if it's a lot of work, i might just settle on being mediocre.	yeah, i've been absent more often than not lately thanks to life. but i will tell you i'm pretty awesome. ;)
1	Aw shucks! And I reckon in Kansas they won't ever care whether or not you learn how to spell ATHEIST.	This is a major defeat for the Pastafarian Movement and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. If Intelligent Design Creationism can't be taught in public school science classes, then there's little hope for FSMism to be taught as an alternative. All we wanted was a little balance between science and faith and for that balance to be initially manifested from the bottom up, not from the top down, which has been the case ever since the materialists and athiests. . . .the athiest materialists for some time to come. . . .well, there's still Kansas.
0	So the stats come from John Lott.... Wasn't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause? http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may...on/oe-wiener31http://whoismaryrosh.com/....a bizarre individual who I don't think can be trusted.	http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdgcon.htmlWhat is so doubtful about it? It makes sense to me.
1	No, this is the point of the 10th amendment. Article 1 Section 8 applies to Congress...the 10th amendment grants all powers not listed to the states or people.   The 14th amendment is not the "federal government can do whatever" amendment.	The constitution does not allow states to do whatever they want for what they may call the general welfare. That was the point of the 14th amendment.
1	Is it possible to be an adult and be as clueless as you seem to be?  This was in response to the question did Jesus not believe in evolution.  Only someone with similar mental capacity to yours would ask such a question.  It seems unfair I have to answer this senseless comment you added to the nonsense.	and the validity of your arguement here rests upon the yec reading of genesis, so it is not conclusive.

1	oh really? then why don't we go naked and live in a forest or jungle? ................ i did not mean to say that i say we are different but the same.	controling the population what population. ----------------------------------- the population of cats and dogs.  =============================== and a human is a animal we are no different. -----------------------------------------  oh really? then why don't we go naked and live in a forest or jungle? ====================================== just because they can't say no they still show that they don't like it. --------------------------------------------------------  yes, animals don't like it at first. they feel pain from the procedure, but it goes away. animals also forget the mental/emotional distress, while humans do not.
1	Or maybe they do? Could this sick, perverted individual be the spokesperson for the so called "gay movement"?	Interesting how when you search this article on google, it ony shows up on anti-gay sites. No pro-gays printed it!Maybe because they don't agree with it
1	So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed?	at least not the kind you chance-worshiping evolutionists want.
0	too right. l. ron hubbard is the closest thing the modern world has to jesus: skeezy, probably un-bathing, secretly greedy but always with a generous front. well, i guess mother theresa would be a close second to l.ron h. xenu.	it's a fictional book designed to brainwash people into following and giving money to a certain organization. the bible has limited truth, if that, and shouldn't even exist. the fact that it still exists in modern society is just a sign of how idiotic people can be.
0	So what? If somebody wants to die then they'll kill themselves no matter what.	Now firearm deaths in the US in 1999 totalled 28,874 of which more than 16,500 were suicides, 10,800 murders and the rest accidental or undetermined.
1	Yep, Martha is in trouble and the democrats are panicking.   I think the strong Independent support for her opponent is due to Martha's own lack of appeal.   By they way, I have to ask....since "The anointed one" was in your neck of the woods, did you get a peek at him? prehaps even wave at him (with all 4 fingers) ;)	Well, as we all know he has been and he is gone. Surprised he had the guts to come and support what appears to be a lost cause. Even if Martha (or as Teddy's son Patrick calls her Marcia) wins a close race, there is a message for Obama and the democrats, "stop shoving things down our throat". Maybe that is the way it is done in Chicago or some third world country run by a dictator.
1	i have never heard a conservative who was pro gay let alone pro same sex marriage. do you know of any? there is an old term that seems to apply 'if the shoe fits'. please i would like to know who these conservatives are that want gay people to be able to legally marry. who are they? since as you say i speak in generalities then you should have no problem listing these pro gay or por gay marriage conservatives. just because someone believes that the government should not be in the marriage busisness, as a libertarian, doesn't mean they support gay marriage.	he implied all. not that i care, i'm libertarian. when i see somebody painting a whole group with one brush as matthew did, i say something about it. it doesn't matter if you think he did or not, imo he did.
0	simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately.	cute, but not quite. the claim is that we want everybody to have guns. so i'd like to see some proof that gun owners have called for the repealing of the federal age limit that covers the purchase of firearms, and for the prohibited persons list that keeps felons, the insane, the drug addicted, and those that beat their wives, from legally buying guns. if those of my chosen party have made the claims that we want criminals, terrorists and the others in these categories to have guns, then i'd like to see them. otherwise the claim that we want everybody armed is nothing more than a lie. the private property of whom? we have security stops along the mexican/american border to search for drugs and other contraband. how is it not possible on the way to and from dc?
0	You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved.	Of course you are.  The American Psychological Association has published research showing that women, for the most part, feel relieved.  Still meaning, either way, it's the woman's right to choose.  Well, it's their decision. Between that individual and their physician, and anyone else they freely choose to involve in that decision. Right or wrong for them, it's their decision to make, not yours or mine, and none of our business.
0	Except that the word for day in Genesis 1 is 'yom' and was understood to be a twenty-four hour day.	The Bible says that God created every thing in 6 days. That does not neccensaraly mean it only took 6 days. The meaning of the word "day" in the language the Bible was written in means basicly "a long period of time". That would explain why some fossils are millions of years old. That does not how ever prove evolution.emoticonXSmilieemoticonXSmilieemoticonXAngel
1	So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?  Interesting...	keep it up zardoz, you only condemn yourself with your anti-christian zealotry and hypocrisy. you claim to properly interpret a bible you admit you don't even accept as truth. the hubris you exhibit would be laughable if it wasn't so pathetic. dr has more humble truth in his little finger nail than you have accumulated in your whole spiritually destitute life. if you would sincerely seek a truth greater than yourself, you might actually be set free to find it. and i sincerely do say this out of love. emoticonxangel

1	i just love how you attempt to be mr. forum police here steve. if you want to be a moderator so bad why not apply? i'm certain this board could use the help. as far as your scenario it's rather laughable but whatever. point being is if people demand evidence why not give them that? i'd rather be an open honest man than hide behind a handle any day.	the admin wisely deleted the link. it was a foolish thing to do. not only that, you don't know how that might come back on the owner of this forum. let's say something did happen and they find out it was because of this forum. next thing you know a free forum owner has a lawsuit on his hands. probably not gonna win it but you still have to deal with that.  rule number 1: 1. do not give your name or any personal information that could be used to identify you. do not request personal information, including age. you're not five, act like it.
1	Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional.	Intellignet design seems to have a large following. The fact that somebody believes in intellient design does not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution. A lot of folks (I would say the majority) view it as evolution used as a vehicle for intellient design (basically "god planned it and made it all happen").

1	For one to have evolution as their foundation belief, means that one cannot be certian of anything.....	People make definitions. They then make statements that make sense according to those defintions. You interept their statements terms of your own defintions. Maybe your definition are in a sense better but many people adopt the position that when someone defines things you interept them using their defintions AND THEIR DEFINTIONS ALONE. You do not seem to think this should be done. This is the main reason why people treat you the way they do. It actually has little to do with them practicing objectivism or scientism.
0	is this a case of the truth hurting? then i guess it would work both ways. how do you feel about 'christians' slagging off non-believers, declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god? conceited? yup. could i give a toss? nope. how do you think non-believers feel about the smugness of christians? and it's not just me who thinks they're fairytales and that christians are delusional, as you well know. so why personalise it? apart from that, a lot of us here have a thick skin. this is a debating forum, and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others.	that they are fairy tales is merely your conceit, as is your idea that they are delusional. they and millions like them would not consider them as fairy tales and would feel insulted by your attitude in this respect.
1	i just told you how. if you want to change your gender, then go ahead... but comparing it to changing clothes is just idiotic.  oh yeah! i forgot, you already think the entire human race is stupid... so i guess you have an excuse.	how is changing clothes not like changing genders? we are control of our own lives and if we want to change ourselves we have all right to do so.
