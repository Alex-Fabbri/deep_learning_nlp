0	well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.	How in any sense is creationism the alternative?
1	yeah, ez is what will come back to haunt you. hay ez you know why i can say anything i want about jesus with out consequence? it's because jesus never existed. sleazy, when are you going to grow up?	- revelation 6:8 beware of what you say about jesus because i guarantee you it will come back to haunt you.
1	Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?	So the debate is just whittled down to two factions; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs.
0	That sounds like an honest answer. How did you feel about it at the time? How do you feel about it now? Just trying to educate myself more.   Huck	another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on (acording to the doctors i spoke with) - i would be unable to work - that's four months, and while right now i am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that, back then i was just starting out, and would be unable to do so.
1	Why would I want lies , deceptions and superstition? I mean, if believing in Jesus makes people act like you, NO THANKS	Then read John 3:36 because it applies to people like you who deny Christ.
1	Looks like my first response to this was deleted? I'll risk it again since this post was not deleted.  Anyhoo,  This post just wreaks of the emotional and psychological development, maturity, morality, character, and integrity of SOME Republicans/Conservatives. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy	well, when the civil war begins, i have no doubts we will win..afterall, we would be facing wimps, sissies and snivelling little brats
1	Care to post some proof or should everyone just believe it because you say it?..	Hitler was definitely gay.He couldnt have proper sex with a woman.He surrounded himself with big beefy males .He liked to walk around in leather shorts.Have you seen his speeches..they are as camp as you can getHe loved to watch musicals.he had an enormous chip on his shoulder and an inferiority complexHe was gay alright.As for Goering.....
0	It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!	Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?
0	you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are. any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what "morals" should be drawn out of the biomorphs.	So, this magical program that is supposed to represent life actually can also produce aeroplanes!
1	loll i love how you completely ignore the link i posted ehh?? and then you downvoted me and tried to sound smart afterwards, but actually made yourself look like twice a fool. :d. you better upvote me again. smh. hah.	if it is bs as you say, then you should be able to easily provide rebuttals to each and every acronym, no?
0	Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.	The fossil record does not support this.
0	Almost? Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.	The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population.
1	So, am I looking for attention or am I mentally ill?	Once some of that turns up, I will start to keep an open mind to your side of the story.
1	much more is happening in the world today than your little gay crusade matthew. but keep your single issue, and totally limited perspective in life, that's what you're good at. could you post where i said that revelation speaks to the rcc vs the protestant reformation ms ? as christ was a jew trebor, his followers wont ever cease to exist, just as god has preserved the jew according to his promises. i'm surprised you can't appreciate that my friend.	actually, it will continue till christianity is a dead religion, cause 'jesus' is not returning..
0	Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By "true human" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent. I have got to go to school, continue this later.	It begins to look, then, that this is a piece of crude propaganda (see note below), deliberately manipulated to give the false impression that the fact of evolution is seriously under scientific question, and that the fanciful notions of creation `scientists' are contributing to that debate.
0	No. I never mentioned grades. You brought that one up. I'm saying that having guns on school campus isn't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area.	So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?
1	"while at home" huh. When did your right to self-defense end at your property line?That is quite a stretch from an old bubble gum chewer even like yourself sliiiick.Thank G-d I live in Texas!!! Those facists states are already failed states so it is semantics anyway when the slaves get restless. criminals are a tyrants wanna be best friend.Everyone should know by now that the cops have no duty to defend anyone no matter the excuses...you are on your own. Everyday I read about the predator leos preying on the electorate so which is worse?	I don't believe Mr. Hamm was refering to the issue of CCW at all, just the right to defend oneself while at home.
0	You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples.	This entire issue was dealt with on this threat here, starting at post250.
1	are you kidding? uh, i hate wasting my 1000th post on you, but here goes. i don't believe that the pm was vile and profane, because jitobear doesn't do that unless you get her really ###### off. second, you're not the most credible person on this forum. and no one has lost it. maybe in your mind, but not in reality. is this how you react when you're cornered, when your bible rhetoric fails? because its kind of pathetic.	but there's still hope for you all if you'll turn from your anti-biblical folly and quit with your failed moral relativism.
0	Well that is good that you recognize our society eats too much meat and too much protein. Now will you agree with me that you can get all the protein you need from whole wheat bread, oatmeal, beans, corn, peas, mushrooms, and broccoli? Now granted some vegetarians eat alot of junk food, and in that case they are NOT getting the right amount of protein. But many vegans like myself dont eat ANY junk food and follow the recommended food pyramid for vegans. I follow it very strictly and I know beyond any doubt that I am more healthy than the vast majority of Americans out there.	It is only because we eat too much meat and I had said that before.
0	I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.   Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.   You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth.	however, most religions that i consider 'christian' are really not the same as 'catholic.'
0	The anti-abortionists claim a load of **** on many issues. I don't listen to them. To put the "life" of an unfertilized egg above that of a person is grotesquely sick IMO. I support any such stem cell research wholeheartedly.	The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.

0	So God gets to do these terrible things, but He gets a free pass because He's God?Kinda funny what happens when you show Archie that the Bible doesn't even support his beliefs, isn't it guys?I still like the fact that the Bible says not to count children under one month of age as persons, yet here Archie expects us to count a zygote as "a human life."	If your knowledge of the bible, and your understanding of Gods holy nature is so limited as to not know the answer to these questions Matthew, then me answering them isn't going to change your mind about anything you currently believe.

1	Other than the Soldini firearms were purchased legally there is no proof that he had a concealed carry permit. If he had the AP and the rest of the left-tard media (redundancy alert) would still be shouting it from the roof tops. Just because the Brady bunch-VPC says so doesn't make it true. Then what else can we expect from a self confessed torturer of helpless small animals and arsonist?	Six people out of, at the very least one million, at the very most five million.Are you really gonna prosecute one million plus people based on the actions of six individuals?
1	Ah yes, the 'Let's pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult, therefore god exist' routine. That arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique, or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to Christianity. It does drive them away, so please, be my guest and keep on trying to use it. I figure the ratio of people you drove away from Christianity to those people who were converted to Christianity from you must be way lop sided.	And I say you're both spiritually-challenged and don't know what you're talking about.Jesus is Lord and all who deny him are antichrists (1 John 2:22).And anybody who's a Trebor-trekkie can't be all there anyway.

0	Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.	It seems to me the corollary of the phrase "abortion is murder" is "miscarriage is manslaughter", and that any consistent pro-life advocate must urge any mother who accidentally loses her child due to actions she undertook, be charged with manslaughter.I wonder, is this actually the case?

0	State courts can rule based on state and/or federal law. In this case, the answer was found in the state constitution, so the judge did not need to pursue the issue further.Also, a state constitution can offer more protection that the federal one, as long as, in so doing, it does not contradict the federal constitution.	The California judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the Federal Constitution; it would have to be taken to the Federal Courts for that.

0	Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them.

They will not necessarily get paid less, there will just be fewer of them.

The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.	What if the answer to that was 0?

0	No Peeling, it would be, "We proved it was possible to evolve as humans have, so why can only we do it?" Why hasn't one other creature on Earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution? If evo is real, then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that weren't forced into extinction, but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years.Unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever. And that is my claim and belief.	I can't recall the name of this particular fallacy, but if I were to name it it would be the "If it were possible, someone would have done it already" fallacy, the consistent application of which leads one to believe it is impossible for anything to happen for the first time.

0	I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.	Because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist, "ToE", that is, that such novel trait changes/'expressions' originate from-- "Random Genetic Mutation", coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that "Natural Selection" does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring.

First thing I want to say is that I dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option.

0	you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there.	as i said previously, 'tookie's' defenders seem to be overzealous in their defense of the man (i can only take your word for it since i really haven't been paying much attention), but i do not see how their accusations have anything to do with hate crimes, and your perceptions of how they're enforced.

0	addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails	If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created.
1	as i observed earlier, you seem intent on attacking islam. why else would you devote so much energy to a thread entitled 'muhammed's child bride'? you've said it yourself, as in... and... howard suggested to you that you might learn something about islam by reading rumi. you asked me to quote to you from rumi? very well... spring is christ, raising martyred plants from their shrouds. their mouths open in gratitude, wanting to be kissed. the glow of the rose and the tulip means a lamp is inside. the wind is the holy spirit. the trees are mary. the scent of joseph's shirt comes to jacob. a red carnelian of yemeni laughter is heard by muhammad in mecca. and... moses, the inner light of revelation, lit up the top of sinai, but the mountain could not hold that light.	though i realise this in itself is predisposing me slightly (maybe significantly) to one side, i think it is important to be able to argue your point from the opponents side if you really want to convince or convert someone.
0	so you get to whine and moan and complain (lie) that i didn't address your points, then when i challenge you to support your points against my counterarguments, you say that you don't need to. you're a hypocrite, archie.  ignore it? bhbcu64 made a valid point and made significant elaborations. the only responses we've seen are 'you're wrong' with no explanation, and two 'why does this follow?'s, apparently due to ignorance of that pesky little thing called law.	in fact, you know that even they got it when they ignore it.

If Christianity included gays you would still be one JJ.You think Jesus hates you so youre getting your own backemoticonXRolleyes
0	You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.	You just wish to ignore them as you do everything that contridicts your belief.
1	* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)	true

0	And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world.	I hope you dont believe everything that is written in a textbook that has been changed over and over.

1	You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men.	My question is thus, should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child's unruleiness?
0	AGREED!!!!That has to be BY FAR the best series I've ever read!Also, Asimov's Foundation triligoy is good.

I think Orson Scot Card who wrote:Enders Game,Speaker For The Dead,Children Of The Mind,Xinocide,Enders Shadow,Shadow Of The Hegemon and,Shadow Pupetsis by far the best author that ever lived or ever will live!!!

1	that's me, and proud of it. but i guess you get your jollies when pagan religious symbols or a pagan religious event can be displayed / practiced, but to heck with anything that might resemble christianity? real nice and equitable there, moose.  it got me a lot of 'excellent!' and 'way to go!' remarks from a number of co-workers.  bull. i've seen it, though it's been many decades now. get real. halloween itself is a pagan religious event, if you will do some research for a change. once again, pagan-related religious themes are fine, but screw the christians.  aren't you one of the libs who tries to sell their 'tolerance' (except for anything christian)? reckon so.	did that move get you voted employee of the month from your co-workers?
0	Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist.	I don't have the right  to make accusations about logical fallacies and how do you know I don't know what they mean.
0	I responded to your posts on the thread of "Lets discuss the actual..." I suggest we continue that discussion there.	You made a 'just-so' statement about what is scientific method, and your own talkorigins site suggested this was one of several philosophies.Further you said definitions don't need to be justified/proven, and again I cited talkorigins that shows this isn't the case.

0	Well, their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig. No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all. Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it's money and political and emotional capital. Stick a fork in them Lucy, they are done emoticonXHoho	So according to the Anti-gun side, we should see a humongous progression of citizen killings of innocent citizens, or in other words, criminals, as the number of Concealed Carry states pass their laws and allow permit holders carry concealed handguns.
0	No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.	Evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change
0	This is a push to promote lawlessness. The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example. People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws. This is a devastating precedent for our Nation.

1	Oh, I get it. So you believe, but you don't exactly "believe".	i am agnostic not atheist, but its close enough for close minded people to understand
1	What's sick is your theological comprehension.  God took Ananias and Sapphira (Acts chapter 5) off the earth just for lying. And you want to give JFK, the serial adulterer, a pass? That's how lame your theological thinking is.	have you never sought counseling for your malady?
1	Sigma, I was only joking. It hit me this morning though that if I'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God, I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up "women's rights". ;-)	Not all who are "left" hate God.
1	Speaking from ignorance once again, eh SP? Did you, by chance, ever read the 2000 Census form? Did you happen to see the category "unmarried partner"? I didn't think so. Now, go eat some crow. emoticonXHoho   http://www.census.gov/population/www...0/samesex.html	Yes, JP is using his usual tactic of bait and switch, starting out with a claim, and then replacing it with something that he thinks we won't notice is different.As foundit also pointed out, his statistics show "same-sex" households, which can mean roommates, etc.
1	So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others, should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not?	The figures for the number of gun related deaths in the US should be evidence enough that 'the people' cannot be trusted with guns.
1	Hmm.. does that include the Muslim Communities you were associated with too?.. We know as rational people that Denial is the Christians best weapon. You should seriously consider increasing your medications..	Especially since I, a born again believer is here adamantly denying that I or every christian community I have ever been associated with would ever support or endorse a christian oligarchy in the USA.

0	Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.	ANY aspect of science that can be discredited helps strengthen the creationist stance.
1	I dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  Once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  We are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but I am sure the preacher would condemn that too  If you read the link you would know.  If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  You really should try to use your little head more.  'Lets stay on topic' who made you a mod?emoticonXChicken	and for someone who doesn't tolerate government intrusion, you sure seem to like government intrusion when it comes to interfering with marriage.
0	Use some basic comprehension indeed. How do you think Dohzhansky 'produced' assortative mating? It was by letting the laboratory population go on interbreeding for enough generations - exactly as happens when assortative mating occurs within or between natural populations. What, did you imagine he operated on them, or something? Geeeeez..	How do you ignore that?
1	Yeah, and we all know what happened when they did that with Galileo. emoticonXRolleyes	Because the RCC has held for centuries that their version of "THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH" trumps scientific fact.
0	Because, when each is in its natural habitat, they are reproductively isolated.	so why do they call polar bears and brown bears different "species" when they can breed and produce fertile offspring together?
1	Strange, I thought it was supposed to be a global flood that wiped out all of man except the chosen few. That would be 'involving Australia' one assumes.	It's more probable that the other culture(s) stole it from the descendants of Noah in the first place.As for Xcaliber's Tourette Syndrome rant about having to go to Australia to pick up Koala bears, God doesn't need to do that.
1	i think you underestimate the intelligence of a 6 year old and what they can comprehend............... and that 6 year old is not only the people but the future which makes it even more imperative that he or she know the sacrafices others have made to make this country the great country it is........ i am not surprised you call it brainwashing though....... emoticonxrolleyes	and i think you have it a little mixed up, this country is the people.

1	But you sure don't hesitate to portray them that way when you use one to bolster the other! Or when you fail to actually (GASP) qualify the matter by noting the differences as well as the similarities. Hey, it's just accuracy, so why get in a fuss over it, huh? emoticonXRolleyes Why not go ahead and invoke the Jewish genocide while you're at it, or call anyone who has a different opinion "Hitler?" I mean it's the same sort of generalization.	In the name of all that is evil and unholy ...Jyoshu - I have never said that the civil rights movement of blacks and gays are identical!Not once!
0	But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority.	The problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people.
0	So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?	I don't believe in any gods, but thankyou for assuming anyone who disagrees with your ridiculous assertions about proving gods non-existance must be a theist.Just like creationists assume anyone who disagrees with creationism must be an atheist.You're just as bad as them, and your arguments, if you could call them that, just as short on substance.
1	like in afghanistan? hopefully it will go a little better with this puppet, his own bodyguard was the latest in a slew of assasination attempts.	no one likes war but you got to do what you got to do.

0	So producing a child is the defining characteristic of a marriage? What about love, trust, respect, companionship? My wife and I may decide to not have a child, does that mean our marriage should be made illegal? Again, you keep posting nambla this and nambla that. Nambla is a group of deviant pedophiles, homosexuals despise this behavior too. GROW UP DHARD...I mean DMG2FUN. ;)	When two gay men get together and have sex that produces a kid is the day I will defend gay marriages.Plus if this is ok then why do gays need organizations like nambla to recruit children into the gay life style.
0	Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?	Not in matters of science.
0	No more so than the Scalia/Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case.	And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.
0	And as their populations grew over thousands of years, civilizations seperate out and independent nations form, laws are set up, and some prosper while others wallow in poverty, how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets? Nice dream, but real life does not work like that.	As much as I'd love pacifism and peace and tolerance and all that wonderful stuff, and I do believe, as my signature says, that violence is the last refuge of the incompetent, it can't be helped so long as we live in a world where people think they need violence.
0	take a look at your post no. 80 time-stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said ...in response to my post #79 wherein i said: does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say? back in post #77, i requested that you quote and debunk the links. you merely scoffed at them (as i expected). prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument, please explain the above. i'll be back next week.	not once did i change the meaning of anything you said, so unless you'd like to quote where i did that, all you have is baseless assertions and a cool method of squirming out of statements you cant support

0	so what about jesus' life is credible if the source is unreliable? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead? what did the authors get right? i mean, i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace. but you dont. so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did?it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true, otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have.	Some may believe that it's the unadulterated word of God, but looking at the above passage it's also easy to believe that it's also the work of common people.The rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line, and I believe I've shown that a reasonable person might not, so I'm going to skip to your next paragraph.
0	The majority of criminals don't want to deal with trouble. Most aren't looking for a shootout where there's a risk of them getting shot at and most don't even want to shoot period. Most are just looking for the free stuff they can get or in cases of rape they're definately not looking to fight an armed victim. It has been shown that criminals are less likely to break into a house whose owner has a gun.	More likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance.There is no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand-gun
1	I think that might mean that you should shut your trap about other people and not pass judgement on them (i.e. Carl Sagan right here in this topic, etc.). What do you think?	Romans 2:11You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
1	If by "We the People" you mean a handful of self appointed persons with strong financial intrest in the running of the country...   The document is largely a copy of the theories of Montesqieu and John Locke.	At the risk of becoming embroiled in a seemingly heated exchange, I think I might interject with a little history....To answer Smiley's question: “who wrote the constitution?” I would say the answer is found in the preamble to the document: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” (bold emphasis added)
0	I don't that it's selfish so much as self-interested. There is a difference. Most people want to live a long life. Is this selfish? The idea of an after life is merely an extension of this same idea.Why do you think belief in an afterlife leads to contempt for society?	I am inclined to believe that the desperation of one to "exist forever" is a very selfish conceit and leads to contempt for the rest of society.
0	The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong?

1	Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.	so if that satisfies everyone's dues then this is done with.
0	maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points.	Again show me something other than an opinion.
1	That is a completely subjective assessment. Thelmoose and Unkerpaulie were already quick to dissociate themselves from any smugness or self righteousness on this very thread.   It's a schism!

0	I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures, such as the literal reading of Genesis (which was never meant to be literal to begin with, but that is a different matter).It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people.However, when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe, science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being.	1) Science has disproven the young-earth Creationists' God.
0	really? wow! my parents did the same thing! we had a water-cooler bottle that my dad put change into for years, and when we were little kids we went to cash it in, all of us helping to roll the hundreds of pounds of coins, and it ended up being worth over $900! ever since then, i've been a coin fanatic. people are so quick to throw away change. my friends know that i'll always take a nickel or a few pennies if they don't want to carry them around.	anyway, my sister and i took them in... about $1000 but now we don't have any coins.
1	It's only obvious to the delusional ones, as I did not lift it from anyone. Just stating the truth. If it hurts, tough.	(And by the way, don't think it's not all-too-obvious that you lifted the "credibility" line from Thelmoose's comments to Jim.)
1	are you clear as to what you are questioning here? or just kicking up dust? sounds like a are you still beating your live in lover type of question from the gunners seat.	would a prosecution for shooting an intruder in the states demonstrate the illegality of using a gun for self-defense in america?

"OK, just for you, one more time, now concentrate like a laser beam...."Irrelevant to the issue of same sex marriage.
0	So have you found figures pertaining to the rate of mountain growth? It is not enough to see with the naked eye the way erosion is. This explanation would also cause some mountains to fall as tectonic plates move away from eachother. Again after billions of years all rivers in existence would be deeper than those in the grand canyon without the material coming down from mountains.	This is know and quantifiable given that all branches of sciences and all current forms of dating back it up.

0	Now you are confusing me. In a previous post, you wrote this: "A gay couple has no more right to marry then two brothers"But now you say that you never said there "is no right to same sex marriage." So are you arguing that two brothers do have the right to marry? I am reading your posts, but you seem to make contradictory arguments. That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway. It sounded like a nuanced argument to me. But apparently that is not what you were saying? Can you clarify this?Thanks.	I did not say there is no right to same sex marriage and I did not say that same sex marriages should be illegal...I thought that you read my posts..you obviously do not......

If you or the others are bothered by his ignorant banter please let me know, and I will stop forcing him to give answers on subjects that he so obviously has no clue.	Just trying to read through a page of this, it seems disjointed at best.
1	oh hun i am sorry, i'll get right on that :) but yes i retouched her scars, she's a cutter for sure...	for work of course, not for my birthday present.
1	We are figments of our own imaginations, sent here by Satan to annoy the faithful! emoticonXAngel	I guess people who think homosexuality is "just a behavior" must think celibate homosexuals don't exist.
1	Er . . . how do you know that god hasn't told anyone to kill enmasse (in the last 2000 years)? Does he run all his orders by you?	I am humble enough and introspective enough to look at my own past, recognize my own human frailties, nature and shortcoming and humble myself before His perfect wisdom and knowledge to see clearly that which isn't clear to me at the time.Also, just to clarify, God hasn't told me or anyone else to kill anyone enmasse in 2000 years since the advent of the Age of Grace which Jesus, our Messiah ushered in.
0	Just like the Brady Campaign. Often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals, most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with, or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens-rea and weren't crimes to begin with.	Those given to emotional rhetoric don't mind one bit if it suits their agenda.
0	Among other things, generally adaptions to a colder environment.    As for your theory as a whole, doesn't the whole 15, 000 year gap between the extinction of the Neanderthalls and the development of farming (particularly the grains youre talking about).	There are quite a lot of other differences between modern human and neaderthals other than just 'brain size'.Well, right... neanderthals were short and stocky and big-boned...
1	are you retarded or just ignorant? either way, get your facts right. limbaugh and savage do not have tv shows so if they want to listen to beck they still can on the radio. second, you imply fox fired beck...umm, no. third, the glenn beck program was the third most watched cable news program between two other fox news programs.  i'm not a fan of the glenn beck tv program but at least i'm not going around making stuff up.	his listeners will have to go to limbaugh, savage or some other purveyors of tea party issues.
1	the ones that make you stupid. you are so passionate about this thing that your judgment is impaired. i am kind surprised that you let your emotions influence your quest for truth. atlas shrugged is as dangerous as the bible and people like you are as bad as religious fundamentalists.	i am there... sorta, but i want to debate not talk about how much i agree with someone :p you know... it was exactly the kind of situation someone like you belongs in.
1	Yes, it doesn't agree with your agenda so it must be trolling.	This post is IMO borderline trolling...
1	Of course you don't. It's the natural humanistic way of thinking.	that's right, i don't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.
1	Wow, that must be some good stuff he was drinking to keep him 'under the influence' for THAT long!! :p	Whether or not this affected his thinking is a question which should to be considered when asking questions about mormon theology.
0	if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?	people have been warning for the last 30 years that deindustrialisation is a really bad idea, and that loading up massive amounts of personal and public debt is an even worse idea.
1	Society highly values the creation of future taxpayers, especially under deficit-spending socialist presidents. :p	Cause frankly I fail to see the benefit of your marriage to me or anyone else outside of your family at all.
1	Yes, mulitculturalism is wonderful. You know what else is wonderful? Fact checking:Archie swallows own foot againIt was the second link when I googled his name. At least try to not look like a jackass every time you post.	Many said that Alghabra’s key supporter, councilor and Liberal party member Khalid Usman who came from Markham, took the podium with Alghabra, announcing, "We have the East, we have the West, and now we have Mississauga!"
0	is this what jpsartre meant? at any rate, to say that there were large numbers of gay men, being infected in the u.s., is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself. there is a connection when there is active sexuality, gay or straight, and aids is a sexually transmitted disease. we actually don't know who patient zero was. what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men, and fewer heterosexuals, to the best of our available knowledge? this is a disease, and unknowingly spreading it, no matter who you are, is not murder. the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group, who had sex among that group, before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it; that would also not be murder.	becuase the thread is primarily focused on the initial outbreak and spread of aids in the us, and to say there is no connection between that outbreak and spread and sexuality either demonstrated that you are either completely and totally ignorant of the facts, or you have utterly blinded yourself in the name of political correctness.
0	But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.	...if we see relatively few creationists on these boards, all that means is, theres relatively few creationists on these boards.
1	I think pedophilia is a disorder as opposed to an illness but I'd have to look back at some psychology books. How do I define illness? Well, I have a few contexts for this. The flu...obvious illness. Christians feel that sin is an "illness", so in that sense we are all rather ill :). As for wrong...same deal.	Well, I define illness based upon the way medical professionals define illness, in which case, homosexuality is NOT an illness, and pedophilia is.Upon what criteria do you define illness?Upon what criteria do you judge them as wrong?
1	why? that doesn't make alot of sense. we say gas go over $2 during a period of relatively low demand. why would gas stabalize that a price that is lower then what it was during a period of low demand when high demand is projected with increases consumption in china the us and the industralized world as a whole? oh yes, i'm asking the person who thinks that cds are good investments during periods of low inflation. emoticonxrolleyes	this is grat news..............so much for the gloom and doomers........i think you will continue to see prices fall and the price of gasoline will stabalize at about $1.85 a gallon.................. the reason why gasoline is so expensive in other countries,especially in europe is because they have huge taxes built into the price..........
0	Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles.	If the intent behind the Chicago handgun ban is truly racist then why allow blacks to own rifles?
1	Then what's Mississippi's problem? They must be run by a-holes because they are being forgotten.	Perhaps his problem was not being able to deal with LA a-holes?
1	Well that lets out most of the supreme court when RvW comes up! And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote. Perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea!	I see that many of you are busily discussing angels on the head of a pin questions.My view is that no man ought to have any opinion whatsoever on a woman's decision of whether or not to terminate a pregnancy unless and until she asks him.
0	that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?	that is something i'd rather not do and i am forced to.
0	Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood. And it goes way the heck beyond speculation. Check out how homeobox genes work and how regulation by master switches is understood as just two examples.	On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as “temperature and embryonic diet” might cause proteins to fold differently and thus “whip up” complex systems such as “eyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shells”
1	Yeah, lets tax those rich greedy jerks!!! I mean really, why be equal when you want something for free right??? SCREW FREEDOM I WANT MY HEALTHCARE!!!	You get what you pay for in this regard.
0	based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not.	see... http://www.catholic.net/rcc/loveboth/chapter27.html http://www.factcheck.org/article336.html the number of illegal abortions is also overstated...some estimate it is only around 100,000...considering 1973 only had around 800,000 abortions it doen't seem likely that a year before 1million were done illegally.
1	And so goes the fact you're more than willing to let rapists and murderers go free.	There you go again, conflating questioning with disobeying.Da*n right you should question the cop who pulls you over.
1	But AA's not responsible for that, because he is an A-rab.	He also forgets that an estimated 20 million native americans were killed by smalpox introduced by europeans, or "Joe Christian" as JP puts it
0	Form 4473, question 11a reads as follows:11.a. Are you the actual buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.	Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.
1	And you can be described as a "pre-dead corpse" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???	Baby can be used to describe a human fetus.
1	Your signal to noise ratio was too low for my tastes: too much "wackiness" (I assume "wackiness" was what you were trying for) and irrelevant side discussions.	This is a PIE adapter that goes into the factory AUX/CD changer controls....Listen to one and you will hate the cassette thingy,,,,
1	pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ?   your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.  My advice to you ?  keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.	my age is irrelevant to the fact that i simply know more than you can comprehend.
1	Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.	So we advise against relying on any ‘evidence' he provides, unless supported by creationist organisations with reputations for Biblical and scientific rigour.
1	I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?	You'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent, before I'd agree that they are as bad as you imply, but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes.
1	and yet you ignored the specific link mentioning the current regs while asking for it at the same time.  no, i dislike your techniches because they are unethical, hold double standards, and aren't based on facts.  oh yes, who was the one who asked for the reg link while ignoring it at the same time?  the fact that you quote newsmax says much about how much credence anyone here gives you.	you come up with more unrelated **** than anyone else on this board.
1	So, I guess in your view, educating people against prejudice and intolerance is a bad thing.	I'm sure you're right, but then again, they are also disageeing with countless other people on that point as well.
1	jos 24:15? what book of the bible is that? i thought i knew the names of all the books of the bible used by protestants but i don't recognize jos.	jos 24:15 'if it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the lord, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the river, or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the lord.'
0	could you see language evolving in non social animals? it wouldnt have a reason to.	why would intelligence not evolve in animals that do not have complex social behavior patterns?
1	I guess we all missed your point Justine, whatever it might have been. emoticonXConfused Better luck next time. emoticonXGood	Obviously you missed the point.
0	Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age. What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is? What is the importance of knowing if somebody's white, black or mexican when they're buying a gun?	A more logical explanation is that there may have been racist gun laws during a certain time period but gun control isn't inherently racist.
0	End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.	and you consider it drivel because?the amendement reads:A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
1	Senior citizen yachties stand little chance of defending themselves against pirates.   Piracy needs to be dealt with using military might.	So why should merchant ships be required to go unarmed and defenseless in dangerous areas?
0	If Congress decides to remove the law, what can the military do?Nothing.Logically, they're not a barrier...	...and how military personnel are no barrier to repealing gay exclusion rules, its good for a laugh.
1	** This is the best response you've got!?! What a loser!!	What couints is the functioning of the system as a whole.
0	This is a separate issue, Voice of Reason. Some didn't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally wouldn't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other's right to do it, and that's what I was answering.	The fact you always ignore is your not just doing it to your body.....
1	He didn't pursue the "master race of white Protestant." He was a pure Aryanist, genius one. The very least you could do is get your facts straight, but you probably like spreading this bullcrap on purpose. (Seeing as how you're an atheist.)	why did hitler pursue the master race of white protestant...
1	I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.	the formation or expression of an opinion or theory without sufficient evidence for proof.
0	Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child? Not likely. I think she will still suffer through those thoughts. Killing the baby complicates this. What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion?	The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis....
0	why didn't you think of it? it took me no time at all to find the actual article, who authored it, and how to contact them. from what i have seen of your post, you rarely think at all.	when he responds i may email him myself :)
0	i love how every line, except number 3, has a winking emoticon at the end. haha	oh well, at least i met my 50 character limit.
1	Yeah, there are quite a number of dumb Republican bureacrats running Califorhia.	Correct but its California where common sense is dead and bureaucrats rule supreme.
0	But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government.	Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me.
1	It's also a noun. But since you're unable but to repeat your self, maybe a few more times will make it 'true'	If you take a fish from the arctic seas, and put it in some chilled water (say, 5 degrees celcius) then that fish is going to think it is very hot, despite the fact we would call the water cold.
0	i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a "possibility of existence". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: "greatest possible being". the "greatest possible being", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole "proof" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as "the greatest being possible". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled	Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.
1	As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.	As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off.
1	Damn, takes some real gonads (wait, you're a Lib, so scratch THAT one) to claim the power to get inside the minds and hearts of the masses...a protest by Conservatives MUST be racist, but a protest by Libs is pure and righteous, correct?	Even Fox News puts the attendance in five digits, yet FW tries to pretend they are much larger.2) Pretend a uniformity of presence behind a rational banner, when the truth is that a LARGE segment of attendance sits behind a looney banner (like calling the president racist or Kenyan or secret Muslim or fascist / socialist / communist / nazi).THAT is my point.Or an even more popular one?The strawman argument!
1	What is it that you disagree with? My statement of fact? Or the fact that I made a politically incorrect assertion? emoticonXConfused	Jake, while I don't agree with JP that this should be an issue of blame, with all due respect, your point here is a bit disingenuous--smallpox isn't easily spread by engaging in a given behavior as HIV is--HIV is a sexually transmitted disease.
1	First off, your sick. To actually want to see more death and destruction.  Are Americans somehow less intelligent? Your notions are racist for lack of a better term. What to meet stupid? Walk out your front door and sample the people on the side walk. You'll find the same stupid around the world.	i hope they do bomb the us, but actually get the pentagon this time.
1	Funny. Foreigners are always cited when liberals talk about how great gun control is and how much good can come from it.	You're not even in the same hemisphere.
1	Apparently in Marc9000's small, small, small world, if you're not a Christian, you're a atheist.   Thus over 4 billion people are atheists. emoticonXAgree	It pretty much puts an end to the argument if you're an atheist.
0	Very sad news. I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery.	His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up.
1	That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.	OH, OH, OH.., How much you'd like to relegate your immorality to the devil.
1	So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?	Therefore, we can conclude that teaching evolution is not teaching knowledge nor science, and as such, is teaching ignorance (defined as lack of knowledge).
1	I won't hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you've composed. Guess we'll chalk it up to puffery.	What he doesn't want you to know is the depth of lawlesness and infringement is already in effect and is only working to punish innocent people and has nothing to do with crime control...it is all about ultimate disarmament and loss of Second Amendment rights.
1	And the Brady background check has not been repealed either so by your "logic" it must be effective.	There's been no mass adoption of these laws by various states across the country, and there's even been cases of them being repealed due to ineffectiveness.If gun control laws worked at controlling crime, and the presence of firearms actually had the potential to increase crime rates, these facts would be reversed.
1	so, global warming no, but weather control devices, yes? perhaps too many people are playing red alert these days...	as long as catagory 5 hurricans have been happening, it doesn't make sence that catagory 5s are created by a cold war device.
0	were they assigned the ultimate task of interpreting the constitution and determining which laws violate it? if not then their opinion doesn't matter.	even with the supreme court ruling, sinjin and chet have said otherwise... on the day this was posted!
1	so, you admit defeat to a child? you have no argument and can only name call. answer my posts with something other than ad hominem or admit defeat.	if you have no answer to #64, please just concede.
1	So if it was deemed by 'those with the knowledge that give their opinion weight' that a fetus can feel pain and stress during a termination you would agree that the termination should not be carried out..well done	Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight...
1	Really? Well, when I have a kid, I'll be sure to just leave it in the woods, since it can apparently care for itself.	The key issue is that once children are born they are not physically dependent on a particular individual.
1	Balderdash! Atheism isn't science. That's nonsense. And science is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is.	Atheism, (thinly disguised as science) creates the hypothesis that there is no God, and works backwords [sic] to find evidence for only that hypothesis.
1	ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked. 'but of course.' he replied and with that...*poof* he was gone. that explains why he doesn't do anything. no miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...he's gone. and, for those fools who doubt this, i refer you to the book of job. witness how god jumps to the tune of satan when god withdraws his protection from his loyal and faithful servant...merely to prove a point to satan...without cause!	god can do anything.
0	You could've just as easily revived the last thread, commenting on how the antis are unusually silent.	At least Ian responded in a friendly way, and me and him don't even agree on this issue.
1	So, Steeeeve, I take it you are not for a FAIR society?   Is an unfair society a moral society? Please explain. I find it difficult to comprehend.	yes i believe in strict government regulation of business.
0	This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do.	What parts of the Bible are true, and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true?
0	Of course not. That battle has already been lost. Creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class, even when it is called "creation science" and the data is distorted and mininterpreted. The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board (and yes, they were YECs) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution, and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards.	I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase "Young Earth Creationists" in any official capacity, nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught.
1	So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders.	They just make people want to kill.
0	I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think thatthe terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not awareof any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris.	I thought at issue was simply the impossibility of determing precise data.
0	that explains it, post 60, page 4. look what comes up for me. i have my forums settings at 40 posts per page. post 121 which came up was the first post at the top of the page.  regarding ip's, the region/part of the country or world they are from can be determined, so i'll make you an additional offer; if he shows that both easyrider and my ip's are located in the same town in nh, i'll still agree to being banned. i say this not knowing where rider is from but i assume he doesn't live in my state.	either you didn't take a look at the link, or you did and your browser didn't take you to the bottom of the page ad you were too lazy to look for the post.
1	if you can find an impartial judge, i'll take you up.	I will take the position that they should not.
0	And you will cowardly ignore the validity of the difference, as you whine that there is one ...A person goes to the doctor, that information is NOT public information. A doctor / patient can claim doctor/patient confidentiality. It's a recognized and valid situation.But with the "knowthyneighbor", these polls are PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. The purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud.If you weren't so intent on trying to bash, you would recognize the obvious distinctions... emoticonXRolleyes	Now you will come up with some lame excuse for a difference between the two but in the end both are bad ways to deal with the issue.
0	But it's not detecting any "new" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye, but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver.	If a telescope can see a new color, how can we observe the information?
0	That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your "apple falling" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple.	The equivalent of ID is doing all the experiments with the apple, measuring the mass of the apple and the Earth, and figuring out gravity, publishing it, and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments, with no refutations or flaws, and then some people coming along and saying, "well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does, ever think of that?
0	Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.	which kills the women.it is not child birth that kills those women.it is an attempt to abort.if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died.Having a child, is not a trajedy... its just part of life.its not a wrongful burden... or a flaw of existance.. its nature.dah... do you even read what is being posted?-Mosheh Thezion
0	oh yeah i said that because what he said was a sweeping statement and i was just pointing out what he posted is not always the case.	i responded to you because you said 'i beg to differ'.
0	I hope I have already begun to change your mind.	I want to see the evidence.
1	Sheesh ! What a way to bring goodwill to all people in the world, "yearning" for democracy. And if I remember right Saddam was our toady during the first Reagan Administration. Hmmmmmm, wasn't George Herbert Walker Bu$h our Veep then ?	I got the number from the Documental Centre for Human Rights in Iraq, although I did some research on them and they are affiliated with the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, so they're not exactly Saddam friendly.Human Rights Watch puts the number at 290.000 deaths.The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
1	The fact that you think the 9-9-9 plan is good only proves you are as stupid as Herman Cain is. Maybe you and Grover Norquist can get with Herman Cain and start construction on Utopian dreamworld, and don't forget to stop by and pick up your other dumbass Ron Paul on your way .	If you pay attention to the papers or news you will have a heavy air of stupidity around you.
0	so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?	if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy works as long as you do it in the presence of gravity, but that smacks of a circular definition to me.
0	Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.	it may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if i have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, i will have to delete this first half and move it to the end.
0	Yes, it is, and I'll gladly excuse his grammar compared to my zero ability in Hungarian.	Seriously, is English your second language?
1	i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around.	you are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they aren't connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms.
1	that is an utter contradiction. he knows what is going to happen, but wants to preserve our freedom of choice? what freedom? please, explain so i can understand, this 'freedom' which gives rise to only one possible future! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny. no ifs, buts or maybes. this isn't about god deciding our future, it's about whether we can. well, that's one interpretation. another would be 'not sticking our heads in the sand'.	it basically means that god knows what's going to happen before it happens.
1	You know my answer: There is no god and no one "created" mankind. But the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under "Religious" or "Philosophy" section, not abortion.   Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?	You didn't mind commenting about God ('the Lord's prophets') just before I wrote my question above to you, so why are you running scared or bugging out now?Looks to me like you couldn't answer the question.
0	Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, "Turkana Boy" It is also sometimes called "Nariokotome Boy". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil.	I gave you the name and a thumbnail...if you aren't bright enough to go look at a bigger picture than I can't help you.
0	no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe.	if this were the case than non-humans that are biological alive should also have the right to life.
1	Yeah, cause there are sooo many 100 year old corks just kickin around.	The point is, how old the wine is, not the cork.
0	You said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. How is that a misinterpretation?   You're asking for proof of a negative. How many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? We don't know...   Erm.... You're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly. I'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class.	what i'm advocating is that we stop this naive belief that we can save lives by banning guns on and around school property, because the victims of columbine and virginia tech will tell you that this belief is wrong.

0	I didn't answer or you didn't understand? Actually I did answer. The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it. The skull, even though I gave it very ape-like features, is from a biped. There are many examples of what I described.	"Outside of a nutshell, you still didn't answer the question.
1	i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel	to me that makes sense as well, but i just wanted to clear up what it was saying.
1	what country are you from? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law. the legislature writes it, the executive approves it, and the judiciary interprets it. the people have no direct say what so ever.	its because if you want to change law you shouldn't be able to exploit the judiciary..you need to do it like everyone else has (up until 50yrs ago) which is go convince the people and run it like a democracy.
1	Not quite sure what you are talking about, Iangb. And I really don't have time to crack the code so if you have a specific question, just ask it already.	Hey, does this mean you've found a definition for 'life' that you like yet?

1	Why would I worry about a book of myths and fairy tales?	You will all have to bow down and confess Jesus is Lord once you meet him at the Judgment.Recommend you read Romans chapter 3.
1	So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized "Good morning, sweetie", that would be an answer?	You did not ask for a quote which says "we should ban guns" and you posed the question TO "anti-gunners" you did not ask for anti-gun comments.
1	Whose culture are we talking about, here?I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?	That "one iota" we're discussing is a major change: part of the very heart of what marriage is.
0	Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two.	You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.
0	So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant.	If they don't believe in what they're selling, why should I.
0	And where exactly did you hear this? I find it hard to believe a governent that couldn't keep an affair or a low-level break-in under wraps could keep something like that secret.................

1	Say hello to my little friend! We the people, through our State Governments!	Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox today threw his support behind the National Rifle Association's challenge of a City of Chicago ordinance banning possession of most handguns by filing a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court.Cox's amicus brief -- a document filed in court by someone not directly related to a case -- supports the request by the NRA to the Supreme Court for an appeal of the U.S.
0	as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'.	surely, then you are not saying that whole structures such as feet formed complete...that would be a contradiction now wouldn't it.....so answer my question: what about the feet?
1	making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists, with no real knowledge of their situation? archie has no problem. but when it comes to christianity, the obfuscational ploy of 'i don't know all the details' comes out, followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details. she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so. the bible lays out exclusive reasons for 'divorce'. this isn't one of them. this is yet another example of religious intolerance, even to the extent of violating their own religion.	well i was going from the guardian article which was rather more in depth on the specifics.
1	Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone?

Well, since the government passed the gun control laws that gun hater pilot wanted the government should be held responsible. That means the tax payer will pay for gun haters pilot gun free bs!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones at columbine can freely walk around and kill their victims!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones on 9/11 that used box cutters to take over airplanes crowed with people!	Or is that just your style, to avoid any questions that might make you think, keep twisting everyones words around, calling them gun haters and racists, and making yourself sound like a total XXX?
0	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.	Surely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism.

1	Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?	The truth is that all the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare.
0	Besides the hundreds of cases in which such things are directly observed, I guess you're right.	This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist.

0	pay attention. age of consent is still the topic and point. if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five-decimal point factor, that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good/bad societal interpretation designated by non-teens, would it not? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non-status unless those non-teens making the laws had another agenda.	is the question will education and contraception help reduce teen pregnancy?

1	Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers).	It is possible you had the title of Christian without the relationship which gives you this title.
1	What's that? Campaigning and use of taxpayer funded facilities like transportation for political purposes? I suppose they paid the cops for going out of their jurisdiction too?	Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda, and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value, but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that.
0	Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent. You said this:	Why must we make more assumptions based on what will happen in the next 10,000 years?

0	Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.	Why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when I offer my vote/opinion, I am imposing something evil on you?

IF he is writing as Lurch, and someone else comes onto a board, as Ungerdunn, who is just as rude (which is what you are saying), you assume it's the same person? Or, is it because they both claim to be biologists? I guess that having another person enter a forum, and claim to be a biologist would narrow it down to just the same person emoticonXClown All you've done is said you know it is him because one writer is as rude as the other... and that this gives his identity away by some mysterious process, probably I don't understand this as I've never read set-theory! emoticonXWow What should be a very easy question becomes you repeating "I know it is him".Also, has he been banned as Lurch on these other fora?

1	Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. Quick search reveals NO mentions at all. Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical.	And, whether it supports my POV, as I believe it does, is not the point.

1	Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.	If they had wings, they may be blown into the ocean and drown.
1	Even then, your statement does nothing. They aren't "getting themselves pregnant". A doctor is doing a medical procedure, that may or may not result in a pregnancy (ya know, those little sperm thingies?) emoticonXAngel	The number of people that do this is irrelevant, alls that counts is the very fact that it happens, and so it invalidates the the sweeping statement that suggested otherwise.
0	What are you talking about? Please define information. What does "new" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism.	Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information.
1	No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word "prayer?" Why not?

1	point me toward the right way then? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs. please tell us how creationists were wrong. i would gladly like to see you try!	Look at pretty much any post on this forum and you will see this.
1	Yawn, again you keep repeating this. You not only refute yourself by providing an example of knowledge of the unknowable, but you gave an example of what is unknowable, by telling me I'd never be able to know you!	You have claimed god is real, and unknowableTo claim knowledge of the unknowable is self-contradictory.

1	Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders.	In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders.

0	just a question, can someone show me where symbiote posted at all on the thread?  4forums.com political debates and polls - search results he's got 4 posts in the past day. none of which are about what cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08 says they are.  sorry giantorio for cluttering the forum. and thanks cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08, you just proved my point. when i prove you are wrong, you just change your argument and insult me for failing to prove your new argument you just created. you did this as yankee fan on lw. you did this here as cashburn. you're doing it again as roesgen08. same exact story.	- - one would think that someone (such as yourself) so concerned about people posting truthfully about other posters would do so in their own posts.........
1	I still haven't seen an adequate rebuttal to this. Why can't people marry themselves if they are in love with themselves?  I must have missed your response.	All they would need to say is "come on, everyone thought gay marriage would lead to the downfall of man, but it hasn't, and neither will legalized [insert marriage concept here]" Your argument is evidence of the gradual process you purport not to exist.
0	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.	Likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning.
1	oh no you didn't! not g earnst website?  oh yes you did! that would be like me quoting from nato's website.  po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie  potomac river humm.	perhaps you could clarify.
0	Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max.	I see far to many religious people that know absolutely nothing about the universe they live in as a result.
0	that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. were is the biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created. in fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. it is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat. pride caused the fall of the son of morning, not scientific discovery.	by the way how did lucifer become the devil??
0	The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.	why not?Life is cheap and I hold no silly notions.Science should be used to benefit life, not ignored.
0	Umm.. again they are identified as Messianic Jewish. Google 'Messianic Jewish' if you care, thousands of hits. So you now try to personally misidentify this 'Jewish' group on your own terms? A Messianic Jew is a Jewish person who believes that Yeshua (Jesus) is their Messiah. Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post. You seem to be inferring that I am suggesting that such 'change' means a change for ALL Jews, sic, obviously I am not suggesting that.	Can you tell me where in the New Testament it says that the Sabbath has to be done on Sunday?
0	In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use "his/her" or "he/she"... it just gets tiring after a while...)	Separating siamese twins where there is only one heart, allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area.
1	Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so "self-confident" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.	Do you think a blind man can make a watch?If you think he can I am not surprized that you think Mr. Dawkins has superb logic.
1	where did that happen, in your dreams? please note the word ' extreme'. extreme lefties have been just as blood thirsty as extreme righties.	then, we let all the remaining nutcases gather in their own corner so that they can babble amongst themselves.
0	Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible. I hardly consider a 1500 year old book "making clear what he wants". Particularly given that even among those who believe the book, they still can't agree on what God wants. And of course, that doesn't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible. You may personally believe that you know what God wants, but if so it's not because God has been clear about it.	I would say that if a diety can't go out of his way to demonstrate his existance and make clear what he wants This may surprise you, although we cannot observe not test this, God has come down to Earth many times throughout human history.
1	That's like looking at a rainbow and insisting it only has the color red in it.	See I view human sexuality as being the exclusive province of the monogamous heterosexual marriage bond.
1	then why have you attacked kerry and other democrats for voting aganist abortion bills that did not have such clauses?  oh yes, i know why, because you're a lying hypocrite.	i think it goes without saying that any time the mother's life is endangered then and abortion can take place............ as far as rape and incest if and abortion has to take place lets hope that it is before the last 3 months of the pregnancy........
0	d. adams? :)  this is, of course, an entire debate unto itself. i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere. but that it's probable? we simply don't have the data to make that leap. we've got some good theories about how life started here, but we don't know exactly what happened. and even if we did, we don't know how common those conditions are 'out there'. if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years, and for all we know they might be, than we may well be the only life in the universe. logically, we just can't say. we don't have enough info to apply logic to the problem.	space is really, really big, so big it bigger than you can think of big.
0	Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment.	The monks?
0	Depends on the usage. Generally, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population.	Does the term "evolution" refer to ONLY the "advances" of life over time?
0	You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt.	Common sense says that if we are all on a downhill slide that mutation/selection – being the conservative/degenerative devicees that they are -- could have never have explained the origin of anything.
0	I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood	My point wasn't to show that the unborn is a person but to show that the real question isn't "Who gets to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy, the woman herself or some nameless faceless bureaucrat?"
1	wow, there you go again. first we can cut health care costs by hiring lots and lots of doctors and nurses and building lots more hospitals... which have to be, you know, paid for. now we can cut postal rates by hiring lots and lots more delivery people! who have to be, you know, paid. in your view it seems that any cost can be reduced by spending more money... it's fascinating really.	ups and fedex would hire more people where they would be able to cover the vast plains of the united states.
0	This is the most asinine argument yet. The man was making six figures as a radio talk show host. Why would he leave that job to hit the road for 18 hour days away from family merely in the hopes of hawking a few extra books? He had an ESTABLISHED platform to sell boks viz a viz his radio show, his frequent substitutions on other programs, and his status as a darling of the Tea Party. The man could line up paid speaking engagements to hawk his book. Why would he trade that for unpaid speaking engagements to hawk his book?	und the country using those talking points without any actual knowledge of what he's even talking about, and when confronted with the reality that he knows less than a rock about any given subject... well that's just stupid.
1	You would say that, because you are neither a woman, nor gay. Families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist by the way, and women and children had few rights. The family structure was "secure" that way. Yes, the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage, is just such a good thing in and of itself. This meant fewer people burning in hell, which is what is really important.emoticonXRolleyes	I wouldn't want to go back to that time, but it definitely had it's pluses.
0	Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.	It has been addressed several times on this forum and the best evidence available shows that effect B is greater than C.
0	In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic "mutation" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained.	If this mutation is random doesn't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as, in the long run, only the offspring of the mutated species would survive?
1	I think you're VERY mistaken.I'm not a republican. Nor a democrat.Never been registered as anything other than 'independent'.I'm such because I think.Unlike a party parrot that you seem to be yourself.Since I'm neither...who the hell can "I" be in the minority?Must be your biggoted knee-jerk reaction to think that anyone who doesn't think like you and slurp the Flavor Aid is the opposition and as such must be in the 'enemy party'.And you are a hater because you verbiage is hate filled, caustic and ever insulting. And not in a funny, jestful way but full of vitriol and bile.	You do a good job of regurgitating all the Reichwing talking points.
0	One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies.	is it that creationists are making assertions without understanding what they are talking about?
1	I would argue against this but I would need to introduce subjectivism into the argument. lolemoticonXCensored	It's the principle, not whether the organism is sentient at that exact moment, but whether it as a category (species) is sentient.A sleeping person doesn't lose their rights because they can't pass the mirror test unconscious.
1	Are you kidding me?! You think that blacks living in Third World Carribean and African countries are "content?!" They're starving by the tens of thousands per day or living so far below the poverty level that it's unimaginable. Maybe you should wander off the beach sometime and see for yourself.	yes criminals existed, but not in the rampant way we see today.
1	But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?	In Genesis, humans are created seperately from all other creatures, but apes and monkeys are not specifically mentioned.
0	You can do so, and if I don't check your source I guess I'm SOL, eh? I've seen the story many places, but this is beyond simply a site dedicated to outing Bush since its a radio show :P	All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past.
0	They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?	I see no duplicity between the two.
1	Functioning? The fetus breathes freely? It cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable? It demands attention? It smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it?  Wow! Didn't know that fetuses were that active and functional.	but that only makes sense when the womb is empty.
1	funny how all those previously plentiful miracles, burning bushes, and personal appearances dropped off so suddenly 2000+ years ago... innit? enquiring minds want to know. non-enquiring minds don't want to enquire.	i mean i'm not asking for anything more than a personal appearance.
0	Well you don't need to doubt it. I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need.	Granted these are all not necessarily plausible, but never-the-less they are just as plaussible that the dog was subject to a random bout of evolution.Further, you said..."Just to show what my personal feelings are on God, if I seen him appear in the sky right now and waved at me, I'd drop all my previous ideas and accept that he exists without hesitation.
1	And you offer none for your's. Heteros engage is risky business as well. Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage.   It's not just STD's, it's all sorts of physical issues as well. Cancers, hepatitus, bacterial infections, that result from anal and vagina sex. Add one word and BAM, it works aganist you.	Thats what I thought..... no defense for your perverse behavior.
0	Very well said. However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected. That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights. However, safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense.	It worked just fine for the first half of the 20th century.And training should never be a requirement for exercising a constitutional right.
1	Don't get your panties in a wad, 38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control this clown can dream up.	The Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer of the nation, is "the enemy", but this is not paranoia.
0	How do we know anything for sure? We can't be certain of the Earth's age in billions of years, but we can use carbon dating to figure out it's older then 55,000 years, which refutes creationism.	#4 - How do we know without a doubt the world is billions of years old?
0	Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us.	Global warming may or may not be the result of what humans are doing, although it sure isn't helped by our destorying the environment.
0	...i usually go to the one on morena. and heres why i'm telling you: it's a big ass world out there and you don't know what i look like. also, it's a fantastic costco and i'm proud to shop there.	btw, which costco do you go to ;)
0	You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?And to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?Smiley	What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death.
1	You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts.	I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime.
0	So what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions.	Either way, the theory of evolution can explain the DNA change with fewer assumptions.
0	You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience. A discussion about the various methods (and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html	If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest.
0	I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.	Removal of body parts by whatever means does not change the dna of the rest of the body.
0	Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is "treating them as breeding animals". Kind of an odd thought.	No, it doesn't make it right but it's not right to treat women as breeding animals either.
0	Our side? I don't get the impression we're on the same side.Besides, I think the subject is decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies.	Yeah if we could get a good portion of the pro-life people on our side we might stand a pretty good chance of significantly decreasing the amount of abortions.
1	Wow, what a group of rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error. I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are. That's why the bible say's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God.	In terms of our lives, that's not important.It amazes me just how dumb creationists are.
0	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.  In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work.	S Africa has the most restrictive gun laws on the planet.
1	O.K. lets' play your game. Gun control has worked exactly WHERE?	I agree with this but you have to remember what works in one place may not work in another and visa versa.
0	No, the question is why you let violent individuals remain free in public.	The key question is, really, whether guns make violent events more lethal.
1	Oh, it gave me quite a shock when that happened! I wasn't expecting it at all! emoticonXRolleyes	Tell me Dzeron, are you at all suprised when provided the means to prove his claim, VOR fails horribly?
1	Oh, so this only happens here, huh? Every single hardcore drug addict is here, huh?	Not a coincidence, just a stupid population to look at to understand whether marijuana does or does not lead to "harder" drugs.
0	Because Humphreys went out looking? How many should we allegedly find?	There are not enough stone-age skeletons ...
1	The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.	It doesn't agree with the study done by the Violence Policy Center.
0	Yes California is following European socialism. Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes.	You need look no further than the current state of California to realized that the United States is heading towards socialism just as Europe has in the past few decades.
0	Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers.	Losing a fetus should not be a big deal to the pro choice lot on this forum, considering the effort they put into arguing that a fetus is either the equivalent of a parasite or a piece of tissue with no value .
1	Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure.	He was arrested and spent several hours in a cell when plainly he had not broken any laws.
0	prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator.	when have liberals ever been upset and outraged over a criminal being given a deal?
0	that's fantastic! i say you go for it, and... um... pics or it didn't happen.	i think he's nuts!
0	Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.	variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation.
1	Sure you don't want to address the gaping holes in your argument. That's up to you.	All right, I'm not going to bother picking this apart line-by-line every day....
0	oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free-will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise. there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it. but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free-will i have not bothered to collect it. humans do not have free-will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of.	regardless you still put forth a premse in your rebuttal which is not subject to either proof or disproof.
0	[quote=mae] land that didn't belong to the un or israel. or current american aggression? what's the difference? both are imposing their ideologies by force. you make it sound like choosing a sports team; for or against based on personal opinion.	[quote=georged] 1) crucial difference is that the un gave israel a piece of land in the middle east.... not so for china in tibet.
0	rrriiigggghhhtttt.... do you really think your opposition to ending medicare / medicaid would just come from the recipients? no. it's like kids being afraid of getting their haircut. it's much adieu over nothing. and then when the haircut is done, they realize it's not as bad as they made it out to be... and they eventually recognize the need for the haircut...	anybody honest enough to denounce our socialist leaning predecessors in congress and the whitehouse could never get enough financial support from those that suckle off the gov't teat calling themselves 'democrats' of all things.
1	But if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. You are a rightwing hypocrite, Archie Baby.	It should also be noted that according to the Mass Constitution, the people have always voted on such issues.
1	Well, I guess this all just proves that more brain dead crack babies are surviving than I originally thought.	I think I should move to another country.
0	this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional.	scotus could rule that ffca isn't applicable because it is a license issue and not a statute.
1	Is this another attempt of yours to paint all that believe in smaller, less-intrusive government as loonies? Very transparent, sorry. :(	Your anger isolates you.Your vitriol isolates you.And furthermore, to quote Mr Williams..."Until he embraces the whole country what else can I conclude"Bush catered to the Republican extreme minority on a variety of issues.Where the heck was this talk then??
1	wow, good response. you know, attacking foul language instead of making a proper rebuttal makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.	throwing out the f bomb doesn't lend you any weight; it just makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.
0	It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.	On the subject of analogies for genetic information, would "computer language" (code) be a better analogy?Indeed mutation and evolution *could* be shown with computer viruses.Of course this would require some familiarity with computer code.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language
1	To summarize, since penfolds reasoning has been shown to be both ignorant and short sighted, his only recourse is to offer a trollish quip before skulking away like the irrational philosophical coward that he is. At least you're consistent penfold. emoticonXRolleyes	I defer to your greater personal knowledge of the depths of ignorance.
0	Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. "judicial fiat" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals.	But that of course is the fear that many have, i.e., that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat (whether at the state or federal level) rather than through legislative means.
1	wow many false gods beat an actual one. christinity may only believe in one god, the god.	they could easily defeat the father, the son, and the holy ghost.
0	Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual. What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for "walking in a mile in another's shoes". Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?	I do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother's life is in danger, otherwise they should live with it.
1	And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing. Science should teach currently held theory.	While most of the commonly held conjecture certainly fits the evidence at hand, there may be other explanations, explanations we have not even thought of yet, that also fit the evidence.
1	So says a ghoul who delights in digging up the body of a dead man.	You do realize that the man that Brown is replacing was a drunk that killed a young woman, went home to sleep it off and THEN reported it to police 8 hours later, right?By Kennedy standards, almost anybody is a step up the moral ladder.
0	yeah horses are so cute i love it when they eat sugar right out of my hands it's so tickly	horses are my favorite animal.
0	You benefit from all of these. They may not be direct benefits or even benefits you want but when it exists we all benefit. Frankly, the IRS is just an idiotic one. Your whole argument only works if you have the IRS to enforce these policies. Could we go without SS and Public education? Probably, but I prefer a system where society decides on what is a "public good" and we go with that.	Social security, IRS, EPA, the public school system are at the top of my list.
1	I'm not a "TROLL" unless of course disagreeing or believing differently from you makes me one. If so then I wear the title with pride.	If they are not trolls, then ignoring them may give them the time to focus and actually respond to some of the posts in an intelligent manner.
0	this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic	God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature.
1	Whatever. emoticonXRolleyes I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here, but that's up to you.	I think part of the problem is that you don't need to "explain" that to me at all.THAT is my point.You consistently criticize the gay side for not acknowledging that it's their "belief", but you are repeatedly "not addressing" their side regarding the ACCURACY of their belief.
1	And Anarchy. Am I allowed to kill someone if I feel like it ?	Voting isn't a third way, it is the rule of the majority by virtue of their posession of the greatest force.It is where voting does not decide, but where individuals are allowed to decide for themselves, that there is freedom and justice.
1	Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions?   Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?	Can you guarantee that what appears to be a simple mugging will come to an immediate halt once the mugger is complied with, and that he won't push for more than mere material goods?
0	So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?

0	I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. "Evolutionism" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?	the notion that the bible is completely and uncompromisingly true is paramount to christianity.with all that in consideration, it should be no surprise that christians will do everything possible to show evolution as false
1	And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be.

0	Marriage is a secular condition set up by various Societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders.Religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it.You don't curse the Church you lobby Society to see if you can effect a change. People who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change.	BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry.
0	You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.	What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education.

If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she can abstain from sex.
0	I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the "I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me".So yes, I "a real pro-choicer" agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type.	then why can't a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue is just that a mass a tissue.
0	Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.	It appears to me, that if slavery had been put up to a vote in Texas back before the civil war, and Texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks (which they would have), you could as simply say "Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it IS."
0	marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence.	it would keep you from getting the federal benefits--the legal context.
1	oh yes liberal: anyone who disagrees with vor regardless of their political standing. you would call frist a liberal if he disagreed with you, hell you would even goldwater a liberal if he disagreed with you.  i'm going to mentally replace farfignewgin whenever you say liberal, after all, they have the same meaning in your context.  you can support the troops by disagreeing with any mission that is unncessary in terms of security and any mission that puts troops in unncessary danger. explain to me how you can support the troops by supporting a mission that doesn't help america and gets 1600 of them needlessly killed.	so let me understand this from you libs..........you can support the troops but hope their mission fails?
1	Yep, you libs would love that. Then you could party on end without having your carnal consciences tweaked, LOL! No sin then no need for a Savior.

1	orion's follies: some other goodies from that site... never linked to those specific articles.  but before orion gets too self-righteous, let's look at some ot the topics he considered 'funny' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum: christian crimes - pastor molests widow's boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush's faith-based failure - pastor molest, guns, drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd's 'white ('n' word)'  is this funny? it's apparently real funny to orion. his link also had a pornographic sub-link on the virgin mary, describing her in graphic, profane language.  orion - christ-deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help.	one of his more assinine attempts at intelligent design.
1	Then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. He was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. It was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. He made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. Bush doesn't send kids to Iraq. First of all they volunteer. Second of all, they are older than 18. Please let me know what comments Michael Moore made that you thought were worthy. You might have trouble.	I thought for sure that he would be "outfoxed" to use a pun.
0	So now Wiesmann's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree, but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution...	Wiesmann's barrier has been breached, and in many different forms, some of which I mentioned already (see box 2).
0	i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right.	and here is a link that puts all those quotes in context.
1	Except, of course, the evidence is totally against that. Plus, there is the little matter of infant mortality... and lack of resources.   But hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you.	I'm not sure of the correct time, but there is nothing that says it couldn't have happened in that time period.
1	If you can't prove or deal in absolutes, then the basis of your argument, the "absolute" nature of logic, just became pretty shaky.	i can not prove 100% that God exist, the atheist can not prove100% that God does not exist because absolute proof is not posible.
1	Non-aggressive, yeah. That's why it's Israel that's the occupying force in Palestine and not the other way around. emoticonXWow	Simple, because Israel is a non aggressive Country surrounded by 13 very aggressive Countries who not only vowed to destroy her but have combined their military forces multiple times to try just that.
1	Yes. So you are indeed committing the genetic fallacy. And apparently unaware of the semantic ambiguity of the sixth commandment. Thanks for clarifying.	Ok. you dont have a clue where your morals come from ..is that comprehensible?You are not clear what the sixth commandment means..is that also comprehensible?
0	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.	Yeah, that's generally the conclusion that I come to which is why I see nothing wrong with abortion.

0	i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.	so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it?
0	No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat. To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers. None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing. But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin.	In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.

0	if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?	the 14th amendment further says that the states cannot pass any laws the abridge the rights you have as a federal citizen so a state cannot pass a law either that gives preference to a different faith than your own, the same limitation as the federal government.

1	reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could.	-reproduction  - if the person is religious (i do not believe god will send gay believers to hell, not sure about atheists)  - if he wants to.

0	Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.	We fundamentally disagree there.How long have you been arguing the gay marriage issue.And you state that you SUPPORT equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold-out, right?If YOUR mind can't be changed in all that time, why do you think that we could win over the nation just by having Democrats come out hot and heavy.Furthermore, THINK about it.HOW LONG have we been pushing for ENDA...And we just tried the vote, and it failed...EVEN ON THE ISSUE THAT HAS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORT, the anti-gays are able to stop the win.What do you think will happen on an issue we DO NOT have majority support on?

0	And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because "we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact.	Gravity is a fact because we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it.

There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a "fully developed" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were "totally useless", is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions.	When they reach their fully evolved form, they may have been of use, but until then, they could serve no purpose, and help the dino in no way at all, serving only as excess weight, and larger profile, hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement.

It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses. Different personalites process and categorize information in different ways. Unfortunately for many children, this is one of them. :( And unfortunately I'm speaking from experience.	Do you really believe not spanking your children will make them less likely to hit other children?
1	Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it.	A third or fourth eye is simply a copy of an existing body part.If it's a FIRST eye that evolved, then that'd count.You can't create anything new by creating copies.
1	so, clive, everyone that believes that god created the earth is an idiot? you need to spend some quality time with some that do and i think you'd change your tune.	he's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing xxxxxx that you get frequenting these boards (i can't say i blame him on the latter point).
0	Common sense? A collection of human cells as yet not developed enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human being? Uncommon sense IMO. Just the use of the term "unborn" is ridiculous. Are the rest of us the "undead"?	I don't subscribe to ANY religion.It is just common sense that murdering an unborn human being is wrong.
0	You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.	I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake.

0	I've been posting at least a few times a week. That's a lot more than once a month. I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. I think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked.	You come around about once a month, scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun, and you use that single incident as if it's evidence that there's a serious problem that threatens the entire nation.
1	Gee, and in what year did he state that? 2005? No way. 2000? No. 1995? Nope. 1990? Nah. 1985? Couldn't be. Without more information I can give an exact date, but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984, he must have said that at least 21 years ago (and if he said it in the middle of his life/career, it would have been more like 60 years ago!) - he did not know back then what we now know.	Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”50

0	The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .	In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation.
0	Why can't you answer questions directly?anyway, I support ct in passing civil unions or marriage lite as I like to see it, but It doesn't confer equality. If it is really equ8al than it would be marrige. Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that, but we don't so far and we cannot ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage.)If it is good for straight couples, it should be equally good for all couples. . No one is more superior. Everyone should be equal. Marriage for all is equals.	So you don't support Connecticut passing a civil union law?

0	Those who set the rules can do with them as they please. It isn't illogical nor hypocritical. It IS illogical to assume you can chew gum if the rule is "you cant chew gum" and the teacher allows one student to chew gum.	It would be bad enough if it was just the teacher chewing gum and telling the students don't chew gum.
1	Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???	Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right because of a physical feature is more like the slave traders than everything.

0	As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?	There is a right to own property and to travel as recognized by the US Supreme Court.
0	Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals.	While anyone can accept that a “perfect” judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before.

0	Actually, it's true. One Darwin's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection.	False and that doesn't invalide evolution given how it's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory.
0	And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?	The Christians who want to teach Intelligent Design in schools are an extreme minority that the media, in all its story-searching rating-mongering glory, is blowing out of proportion.
0	Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.	and the lie that the embro has gill slits.
0	so what you're saying is that you can't?  as a political move to satisfy the pro-life constituents that put them in office.	i don't have to do that.........if there were not abortions being performed in the 3rd trimester then why would the u.s. senate pass a bill banning it?
0	Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.	He is a prime example of what I mean.

0	unkerpaulie, thank you for this explanation. boing! eureka! i have finally concretely grasped what a 'strawman' argument is. creating something that does not exist. making mock, in a sense. sorry, i just have to reiterate the term in my terms to paste it firmly into place in my cranium.	i suggest you wait for someone to make a statement then attack/address it, rather than presuming statements that were not made and arguing against them.

0	ooo, the slippery slope argument! always a classic. the right to not be discriminated against based on her sexual orientation perhaps? what part of the dress code was she going to violate? she was going to wear formal wear. it's not like she was going to show up in ripped jeans and a slipknot t-shirt. rules designed to exclude her. their wishes don't supersede her rights.	what right was she standing up for exactly?
0	by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god.	individuals within the church are to use their god given gifts for the building up of the body to love one another and show the world what love is.

0	But is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder? It's pretty easy to find information on the FBI and the CDC websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings. People defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership, not the net benefit when it comes to safety. That would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative.	More importantly, when one gets into a car, they know that they run the risk of crashing.

0	To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition', sure. But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect.	That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition.

Perhaps you should reconsider since you're getting your ar$e handed to you with every reply I write. ;)	My dear Archangel, I wasn't aware that I was required, when I visit these forums (especially when I'm low on time like I was then, and only posted to something that caught my eye and then got off the internet), to check each and every thread to see if you graced it with your presence and to respond to that instantly.A Thousand Apologies, My Lord.
0	Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.	There's no difference between Christian Creationism/ ID and the Wapuri warrior ideal creation myth which focuses on the divine Parrot.If you are focusing on Christian creationism vs Evolution, there is more than one system of creation, and it doesn't necessarily revolve around one omnipotent, omniscient being.
0	Iangb, I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims. I also thought that (by now) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in (in this thread or by private message) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest.' At this point, I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood's definitions?

0	Well, it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain.	I am left with having to trust scientists to distinguish between the two and scientists seem to agree that one needs a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order to register pain - which does not happen until the start of the third trimester.

1	First of all a man cannot terminate tissue he isn't carrying.The father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is.	If a woman who is pregnant with a few "cell clusters" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation.
0	theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them. so i guess yes, its 50/50 so more or less half of these are likely to exist right? every imaginary thing that i could make up, half of that is probable to existing if they all can't be proven or disproven?	big foot, dragons, unicorns, mermaids, there are scientific factors that makes their existence unlikely to live in the current environment.
0	insult? i'm not sure if you're joking or just have a bad memory. but you have been making false assumptions 'aka' insulting me also. i'm not trying to insult you. i'm simply dishing out just like you are buddy. and i don't have to back up anything to a stranger i'll never meet. i know how successful i am and what degrees i have. all these false assumptions you're coming up with aren't phasing me at all. stop dishing out if you cant take it.	they still let old people like you get a ged, so i think you better get one as soon as possible.
0	exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him.	in fact, it's probable, given his devotion to science and reason, that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration.
1	Like you were raised? Looks like it didn't work and now those hormones must be kicking in? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax...their favorite victims? Males.	That would be beating the bejesus out of a kid as opposed to teaching him or her how to govern his or her impulses by themselves.
1	Calling someone a "liar", "fool hardy", "[corrupter] of the truth", and unobjective is considered complimentary where you come from? Odd, but OK, I'll go with it you lying brainwashed fool (hey, this is fun! I like using Archie's compliments!).Actually, my "sick hypothetical" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry "Corrupter! Blasphemer!" and run away. Is this your idea of "witnessing"? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat.	And regarding your sick hypothetical, it isn't a valid question at all as its based on lytes unproven third hand slander, so I see no reason to play a what if game with someone who only seeks to corrupt the truth rather than discover what it is.
1	Let's allow same-sex marriage only. Then heterosexuals will have the same right to marry someone of the same sex.	To me it has nothing to do with equal or civil rights.........It is a special right that gays want....They already have the same rights I have when it comes to marriage......They can marry anyone of the opposite sex...
1	Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?	What's the scoop here?It seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the United States because of all the gun happy nuts running around, everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting.Good idea simone, when do you start your training.I understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they're deep.

0	'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.

Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision.	When was the last time a man's life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant?
0	What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes "conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift.	But I would love to see you try and explain how 30 months in prison, a felony conviction record, and $5,000 in fines for buying two guns in one month is fair, reasonable, tough on crime, and constitutional in nature.

1	No EasyRidden.. It's you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution. America is a nation which has always had a population of christians, but it was never a Christian nation. The Words God, Jebus, Holy Spirit.. are NOT included in any of the founding documents. You can continue to ignore the history, you're the one looking like a buffoon.	Considering you left-wingers have been wearing out lawyers for the last 100 years trying to get all the vestiges of Christianity erased from our halls of government, our history books, etc., America must have been more of a Christian nation than you will ever admit.

0	You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be. This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs.	by gun nut logic children should be able to tote guns around at school because it wont make a difference because if they really wanted to kill each other, theyll just find another way to do it if they dont got guns because you know what guns dont kill people, people kill people!

0	Huh? With a 26" barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards. With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500, but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 (1.51 miles).	Then again that might be wrong and these short action calibers might have a 1,500 meter effective range, meaning that the claimed abilities of the .50 BMG are mediocre in comparison.

0	what makes you think they're not true? jesus arose from the dead. that's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not.  many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale. none succeeded and a number became believers. you guys are playing with absolute fire. if you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. big time and forever. do you feel lucky? well, do you?	for someone seemingly hellbent on accusing atheists of not understanding any other points of view, it's pretty damn idiotic to threaten us with assertions that we know aren't true.

I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.	It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
1	if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane. 'i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.' so you want the government to brainwash them?  are you kidding me? what planet do you live on?! 'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?	i don't think that killing people as a form of punishment is setting a very good example to the rest of the world - if the public start to see authorities giving people death penalties, everybody will just think that killing is ok and it will be a vicious circle!
0	Actually, I don't have any respect for creationism in most of it's varied forms. I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met. But they earned that respect.	Man, you don't have any respect for your opponents.
0	"A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon."The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm."In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'"The News regrets the error."CORRECTION	Ridiculous paperwork traps that even caught and surprised the Queen of gun control!
0	Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another, but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body. They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations' as if that justifies anything. There are things that cannot be morally obligated, no matter the relationship, so the argument tries to prove.	Blood relationships are never based on choice, yet they entail moral obligations, nonetheless.
0	could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess.	i did say that if birth control failed (condoms do sometimes too, i think their effectiveness is at like 97%, but that's not 100%) abortion should be acceptable.
0	People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things.	So if Utah made a law or a governor stated that christians didn't need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws?
1	Where, exactly, did the article say that bacteria exhibit intelligence????	Life at every level -- from humans down to bacteria -- exhibit intelligence and very often cooperation.
1	So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?   If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?   If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?   You are confusing me. Please explain.	the infirtle couples who want to have children and are capable of doing so with sciencetific methods may be married.
0	final, switzerland 1 spain 0. spain, one of the favorites or perhaps the favorite to win the world cup, loses to switzerland. what a shocker. of course with two more matches for all teams in this group anything can happen, but the pressure is on spain. they can not afford to lose another game, even a tie could mean not getting to the round of sixteen.emoticonxwow	that will go down in world cup history, especially if the loss of two points causes england to miss the final 16. i shouldn't have happened, but it did and the poor guy will live with it for the rest of his life.
0	I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The "you believe in evolution" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that.	I don't think this approach is all that new, but I have to admit that I haven't been around as many of the old-school creationists.
1	Oh yeah right, like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them, can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling.	She thinks the university's leaders should have been more open about their failure to provide the killer with adequate counselling, among other things.
1	and mythology. you forgot mythology. for example, the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths. and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed. and, of course, the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology. do you know what logic is? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy, not logic. the myths of noah are not history. and since we are talking about noah, i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed. and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history.	also, the old testament is a testament of history and prophesy while the new testament is a history of the life of jesus, the stories he told, and the letters written to churches about him.
1	Ok genius, explain to me how come it is that I dont believe in monsters, in ghosts,in luck,the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, and so many other things that a lot of people believe in, but yet I believe in God. Do I have some deep seated delusional fantasy or something like that. You seem to be wise and all knowing( maybe all powerfull as well). Yep, im convinced you are a legend in your own mind. You believe what you will, and I will do the same, and in the end we will see who is right and who is not.	I have heard that 'I used to be an atheist' nonsense by so many, yet I don't see the understanding about what it means to be an 'atheist'.
0	Considering your previous comment, that isn't you. Once again, that opinion is based upon who you read.	Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.
1	Isn't the point pretty obvious- that exposure to a gun can raise testosterone levels and trigger violent and aggressive thoughts and actions?	Posting nonsense like this proves nothing, other than the fact that you're an internet troll.
0	then why is it that closeted homosexuals that are completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate? they aren't persecuted or harassed at all since no one knows they are even having these feeling? it is self loathing that feeds their desire to harm themselves. people who know that what they are is right and good, don't harm themselves at all, but defend and support who they are even when persecuted by others. that's how it was for me when i converted from islam to christianity. all of the persecution i received just made me stronger.	umm no we feel these things because were indoctrinated by your pastors, your prayer leaders, and grow up feeling like were scum because you people have nothing better to do than scapegoat others to make your own crazed beliefs more believable.
1	So you are truthful, but I am a liar. Just like you are clever, but I am stupid. You have no respect for me, WW; I've never seen you demonstrate respect for anyone.	Why would you doubt me?
0	You lie. You keep saying the same things over and over again, that doesn't make them true. Your addiction to violence is showing.Tony Martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away. That's not self-defence, that's cold blooded murder.It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them. You don't get to take the law into your own hands. Munir Hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street. That's not self-defence, that's revenge.	Something like this belongs in the crime debate area, where I'm currently handing Jo his head over and over again.
1	Wow that worked well. Please explain where his logic is flawed in the point he made. You cant, because its not. This just proves how much this "point" along with all your other arguments have "flaws in logic" if you will.	This "point" is just mocking the other poster for flaws in logic.
0	Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.      In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak.	in fact, i have never witnessed anyone basing their entire gun control argument on the fact that 'gun owners lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand-to-hand combat.'
0	"Ready to go", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.Barbarian, regarding mutations:There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? .	So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go.
0	How about getting the government out of marriage entirely? That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry.	On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it's accepted standard in this country?
0	well, i can't say that i'm surprised. just another politician for ya. they're all the same.	remember a little while ago when the quite conservative governor of the quite conservative texas, rick perry, ordered that school girls receive the vaccine that can prevent cervical cancer?
1	i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!	you don't seem to want a written constitution either, or at least one that isn't as vauge as ours.
1	You resort to the Bible, just in whatever way is convenient to what you want it to say. Just like fundies do. Zardoz, the problem is that when you play devil's advocate (which you like to do), you ONLY take a fundie approach toward the scriptures. In fact, you're often more fundamentalist in the way you approach scripture than fundamentalists. You'd make a good fundie, the best of them, I suppose.	Just like Arch does.I counter that and use the scripture (which is good for the education in all things) to show what these 'believers' should have done.Now, if you want to actually study your bible and use contradictorary verses to support your stance, feel free.That'd just support the concept that the bible is self-contradicting.
1	The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot.	you could probably start by not calling the majority of people anti-moral, anti-family, anti-equality, anti-American, homophobes.But thats just me emoticonXRolleyes
1	probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.	Why don't you try to make George Walker Bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroying the nation of Iraq, for murdering tens of thousands of innocent women and children, for causing the deaths of nearly 3,000 young Americans who left behind mourning mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, in some cases many children who will be left to the mercy of our nation's horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their lives.
1	Because the soundbite "survival of the fittest" was coined to explain evolution to the stupid masses.	And where does the macroevolution feature in that combination?
0	Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge).	They aren't like puppies or chickens, can't get them fixed or make bar b que out of them.
1	Maybe you are and maybe you are not. You can criticize but there again you may incur the wrath of ole Doc too. emoticonXSmilie	What you choose to do about your laws is up to you.
1	He killed thousands of failed athletes? I must have missed this in the news.	I suppose his shooting of failed athletes was okay by you, also.
1	No. Not only are you wrong, you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. You oppose evolution you say, but you have no idea of what it is. Most educated creationists not only admit evolution, they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh.	You tell me that Job and Jonah are fiction.
1	oh yeah, all the most famous scientists, composers, writers, bands. all girls of course.... no, not really. yeah whitney huston, obviously way bigger than the rolling stones, beatles, who, led zeplin...... yeah great. take a step back, and read some good literature, you might learn something, un biased. opera the most powerful woman on earth> if she is, why will she die in the next 30-40 years, and how come i had never even heard of her until a little while back? how come, if she is so powerful, she is not out curing terminal diseases. oh i guess sitting on some leather sofa trying to get more ratings is way better!	oh that is a sad thing to believe :p dear boy (obviously) whitney houston beats michael jackosn demi lovato beats justin bieber karen carpenter beats every singer on earth<3 opera is the most powerfull woman on earth, obama is said to be the most powerfull man on earth, but i seriously think that opera wins this one too.
1	It might be telling that super heroes typically don't use firearms. That I'd prefer my crowds to have few if any guns concealed within hardly makes me pro-crime. Nor does it make me a pacifist. I'm a big fan of violence. The hands on kind.	He would also break the speed limit, but not run a stop light...but he protected innocent people with violence toward criminals.
1	i am surprised scientists havn't made so much of a fuss about you. wow......	is that like a dude + a pony?
0	Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.	Or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage?
0	good questions. its not a condition, i don't agree.  jesus doesn't open the lock to the pearly-gates for some people, he is the gate. do you see what i mean? that's what he said, 'i am the way... no one comes to the father except through me'. i think its like saying you shouldn't put conditions on the way into a house, you should be able to walk in from any spot - and saying that having to go through the door is a condition. why would people not choose heaven? its a hard road.	i know, you're going to say that people are refusing to go when they don't accept god, jesus into their lives.
1	You still don't get it do you, Smiley... emoticonXBanghead If cupcakes were human? It would.	This does not make it an individual (noun).
0	So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.	When San Jose, California, police test-fired an Uzi, a 30-round magazine was emptied in slightly less than two seconds on full automatic, while the same magazine was emptied in jus
1	Well, I guess you got something there. . . . . .can't put the cart before the hose!!	Yo shush yo mouth!Doncha knows that tha bible is fo believahs!Yas gotta believah furst!That's right, if you read it without believing first, you'll see the flaws and contradictions.
1	Are you jealous because they won't let you out of the institution while gansao get's to run all over the place?	What are you calling it?Are you simply jealous because you lack writing skills and no one has considered you for anything outside of menial labor?
1	Are you trying to be funny in a "I'm the one who drew attention to this aspect in the first place, but now I'm going to criticize you for talking about what I drew attention to" type mentality?	Focus on the reason for the arrest rather than the issue that caused his refusal to leave.
0	I would be interested to see where I made such a claim. Prove your assertion.	Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as "assault weapons" are "inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip".
1	Actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. And anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides.	The same history that led John Major and Anthony Blair to apologize to the Irish people.
0	Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.	The bill would also protect gun manufacturers and dealers that have allowed their weapons to fall into the hands of criminals through their own negligence.
1	thats true. i helped. my next bible will be 10 times better if i get around to finishing it	The Bible was written by many of the wisest men in history.
1	accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'.	you attack bp by focusing on its mistakes so that it can be held accountable by trial.
1	What difference does it make? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents? If so doesn't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas?	Like, how many shooting in Germany?Like, what's the ratio of shootings to population in the two nations of Germany and the U.S?
0	once again when is my life, what i do, and who i love, who i marry, any more thier business then theirs is to me? you still haven't answered my question. why do they get a say in my life yet i don't get the same say in their lives? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious xxxxxx are is just cruel and evil. it is my life my family not theirs. they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust. you are defending an unjust system.	people aren't going to stop standing up for what they believe in, and doing what they think is right.
0	What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842).	BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!
0	if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing.	ok, lets use that logic.... to the gay folks i say marry a woman.
0	I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.	We do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation.As for the secular rights, I don't think this is right.From a religious standpoint, I've never seen more ignorance, hatred or twisted lies put into words as I have on this board from some of the folks who are Christians.
1	Which is why the "medical establishment" endorses smoking, drinking heavily and a fatty diet, with no excercise, because they believe we are predestined by our genes, right? Why do you persist with these blatant lies?	ythe medical establishment has convinced people that we are what we are because what our genes say we are
0	What's a "marriage officer"? If that's like a priest or minister, than certainly they shouldn't have to perform a ceremony that doesn't coincide with their beliefs. But if it's a government position, like a justice of the peace, then they should either leave their religion at home when they go to work, or get a job that doesn't conflict with their beliefs. Religious freedom does not give you the freedom to deny freedom to someone else.	They did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it non-mandatory to some extent:"But it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her "conscience, religion and belief.
0	Criminals continually inform the public that their greatest fear is a victim capable of fighting back against them and possibly killing them.	Criminals, being the lowlife, deviant scum they are, would never be smart enough to anticipate the possibility that their victims might be armed, and would thus never take along guns themselves.
1	jesus christ srom!!! you live in the stone age... i'm surprised you have internet access.	no, i don't watch fox news because i don't have those channels.
0	He's pointing out that the situation is about the mother and the baby, and that the baby's right to life ends exactly where the woman's right to personal autonomy begins. That's the interesting thing about rights-based ethics, that the rights of any individual are limited precisely by the rights of all other individuals.	What are you talking about?
1	Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so "self-confident" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.	If you think he can I am not surprized that you think Mr. Dawkins has superb logic.

0	I think that the bad guys will be happy if any gun control law goes into effect, because then there will be less chance of the victum having a weapon for their defense, and the crime rate will rise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Well I have to say that I beleive if we banned all air guns that violence, murder, carjackings, rapes, and all violent crime would drop.

1	Do you have something-other then words from a dusty old book of myth to offer as an explanation?	Because science continues to LOSE GROUND in its search for explanations for origins of the first life?
0	Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them :)Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.	Monkeys show sense of justice Absolutely amazing.
0	I don't understand this business of the UK and England at all. It seems to me that somebody has a chip on their shoulder. Who cares? Chomsky is not as bad as the terrorists. That's an obvious fact. What is equally obvious is that he provides aid and comfort to the enemy and that's the definition of a traitor.	:)  On the issue of Chomsky, are you saying his writings on American make him as bad as the terrorist who kill and maim People ?

1	I don't know about you..but being shot in the back is more human than being taken apart piece by piece. If I recall correctly, Chinese inmates sentenced to death are executed this way to minimize the pain.

0	Well, thank you for this thread Santafeur. I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff. The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me. In fact, I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about. What difference does it make? We are here now. Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?	what is so fascinating about something you'll never live long enough to witness if it does exist and that you've seen all there is to see of if it doesn't exist?does anyone here really lack in something to validate themselves so much that they have to turn to a bunch of dead animals to find a reason for living?
0	Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.	How can what did not erode for 100 million years to expose a full dino print, now be eroding only within the last 40?
1	Archie, the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says, every accepted definition of the words socialism, statism, capitalism, fascism and nazism. If we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words, it STILL does not work because the argument is STILL illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it.   Face it. You got pwned. Are you really not bright enough to recognize that?	While at the same time, right now, aren't we seeing our own government promoting increased regulations in overseeing the control of these corporations, just as Hitler did in Germany?
0	Sounds pretty neat. I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?	I have been there and felt the chill when I saw what could only be prints of very old humans co-existing with dinosaurs.
1	so you reference shakespeare to explain the song of solomon? seems rather convoluted, but whatever.	you go to the public library and look up the oxford english dictionary--which i explicitly named.
1	Oh, I think you take delight in spelling it out in excruciating detail. Otherwise, you'd reply on point.	I didn't feel that I needed to spell it out in excruciating detail for you.
1	My mistake; I read it wrong. And guess what? I do know what the moon is ;)	I had said "what if" the Moon (You know, that big round object which appears a lot in our night sky.)
0	That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources "until the newborn dies" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.	Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).

Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.	the only stupid gun laws are the laws that arent strict enoughlike the law that gun nuts wanted that would allow children to tote around assault rifleshow stupid can you be
1	since when has religion been pragmatic or based upon systems that works?  Obvious answer: never.	did you read the news report about bush's former friend who taped him regretting his former days of indulgence?
0	well, i'm back from my rejuvenating outing. did i have any epiphanies, you ask?  what, one wonders, could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted, their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived, without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times, and ennoble us in our daily pursuits.	well, my views are probably shaded by my anger of religion, after being under its influence for all of my childhood and a better part of my adult life.

0	Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims. PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.	IM2L844: The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved.
1	Cool I want to be free of the regulation that I wash my hands before preparing other peoples food.

0	religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected. why? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes, unless you are a black gay. it is the way each class is treated that is the same. coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people. the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth.	as explained the last time we crossed paths matthew, there is no evidence presented that would suggest homosexualism is in any way a legitimate aspect of life for differentiating one from another.

1	So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?	It seems clear to me: if you are not sure it's not human, don't kill it.

0	deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said. You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought. In fact, some of the cited refute such claims.	I got no idea what you are talking about.
1	You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican.

0	i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.	the reason we can tell this is that virginia and those other named states do not have higher crime rates than the cities with strict gun laws.
1	You actually have some full insight into gays and what we have gone through and think were pathetic. Once again insults and a bigoted view Archie. You never cease to amaze me.	You may have bought into that image lesz, but I can plainly and clearly see the full extent of the misery index which comes with the homosexual lifestyle.
0	i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?	the point i'm making is the rejection of these doctrines does not make the fundamentalist protestant churches any less christian, nor is the rejection necessarily incorrect, and the same principle applies to reform judaism.
1	Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases.	That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists.
0	With regard to this statement you have to consider:1. How can anyone know what product an "intelligent designer" wanted.2. Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia.But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants.	An intelligent designer would design a system to produce the product as easily as possible.

0	I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.	It's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal.

0	Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to "polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it." Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it.	Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious.
1	to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion.	maybe it could have been a better plan, but what we have now is better than the nothing we've had under mostly republicans.. clinton being the only democrat who also failed to deliver ....
0	Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce "remotely" from Virginia.Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS.	Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely, if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else.
0	i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost.	hard to make people happy when you attack other countries causing you to spend well into debt thus lowering your economy and bringing other economies with it.
1	your daddy plugged your hole?? is that why you are so sour. i guess you ate too many beans recently, and that made you full the holy spirit..	then call the police, or whoever it is you're currently whining to, if you don't like it.
0	and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance? or for credit cards, for that matter? the cost of a policy, or card, is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer. don't want to pay high premiums, take the risk on yourself. period. i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another's morality. we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know.	it is affordable and obtainable for those who do not actually need it, but impossible to get or unaffordable if you can.
0	But my relationship is between a man and woman. You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that. Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman.	OK, are YOU willing to settle for legal recognition of your relationship with your spouse under federal and state laws as a "civil union" only?
1	That sort of warms the cockles of my heart. Namely that some Europeans might be disinclined to visit or stay here. Don't let the door hit you in the buttocks on the way out.

0	See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.	Diseases used to be ascribed to God and it was thought that those people who got sick deserved to be sick because of their lack of piety.
1	I can understand your disappointment. Its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions. No easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim.

WOW, in one fell swoop you completely destroyed my faith in God.
0	When was the last mass murder at a UK university then?	with tens of millions of gun owners, and hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and you think the guns are still the problem....
0	Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.	I thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage.

1	Your "opinion" was a kindergarten question outlining a "problem" that never existed, a "problem" that was explained to you 3 or 4 times.

I just realized it's a waste of time sharing my opinion with you self important XXXXXX who think you have such a grasp on science that you dazzle yourselves into a frenzy.
0	You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean "will", "must", or "shall" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it "CAN" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun.	You should really think about what you say before you say it.

And I'd think the explanation would be that oxygen content was much different before the flood

0	So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's "weak gun control laws" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?It seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to America, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons. They've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there, they can make whatever they need or want.	You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms.

0	an innocent person can be convicted of a crime--i thought that was what the topic was about. just because they are convicted, doesn't mean they are 100% responsible, guilty, etc for that crime-but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system--they are guilty. that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years--they are convicted of a crime. i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics, then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence. okay, everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on--what is it with you people? like i said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.  comprende' ?	are you saying that in the past no one has been wrongly executed when we are now seeing dna and other tech freeing inmantes basically every 2 months?

1	So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is.	Frankly I thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agencies and organizations which they may need to interact with in the future.

Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government.	Right is one thing, but duty?

0	dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views..	if a man can't exercise that self control, to a point where he rapes a woman, then he does deserve jail.
0	Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe.	No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced.

In Plessy the Supreme Court ruled that black men weren't entitled to the same facilities as white men, rather they had to have their own private facilities, separate from those of white men.Forget precedent, the Supreme Court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled.
1	business is a purely private association. you mean like interracial marriage? 'social harm' is just another term for 'things i personally find distasteful'.	i am hopeful that once we get a democrat in the white house, that will change.

0	George Bush won the majority of votes (the first majority winner in 16 years) in an election with the highest turnout in US history (>117Million voters). The Senate Minority Leader was defeated by a nobody. Democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the House and Senate, something that never happens in a Presidential election year. This gave the Republican majority in both branches of Congress even more control. 11 Liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins. If liberalism ISN'T dead, then it's in ICU on a heart and lung machine. emoticonXRolleyes	I would like to point out that it was hardly a land slide.
1	Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:  Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?

1	So you think that ID is actually Christanity?

0	Oh, really? Does that mean that pesticides will be OK on marijuana plants? NO.	* Smoking tobacco is quite unhealthy even without pesticides.
1	And you're baffled that you don't have more intelligent debate with people. I'm shocked.	There is nothing wrong with honest intelligent debate on this issue, but the anti-gun crowd don't bring honest intelligent arguments to the table.
1	oh really, a combination of the words expel and arm mean to expel arms? wow, she was a creative genius! i think what he meant was rowling just takes all the stereotypical magicy stuff and mashes it all together into a tacky and overused paste.	i think expelliarmos means to expel (get rid of) arms (weapons).
1	Did you notice how what I was responding to was said? I didn't think so. Your tunnel vision is showing again.	Its not what you're saying its how you're saying it.
0	what is capitalism? can there be something like 'responsible capitalism' and, if so, what would 'responsible capitalism' be? my view is that the term 'capitalism' has a multitude of meanings dependent upon who is defining it and that 'capitalism' could have a multitude of modifiers to further refine its meaning. is to be a capitalist to be utterly free of responsibility and blame for the evils that capitalism may cause?	if it is, i don't share your sentiments.

0	This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?	I wonder how many of these "great physicists" also believed that night air could make them ill?
0	Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton.	So a piece of stonehas the force of gravity as its own property does not it?
0	but why should i care about their emotions? they obviously don't care about mine. this is in reference to the jonestown massacre, where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink (i don't think it was actually kool-aid) laced with cyanide. okay.	as for the kool-aid: i often see this referenced in arguments between americans, i have no idea what it is.
1	Anyone speaking English could well be an illegal from the UK then, right? I guess Puerto Ricans better watch out too.	It is reasonable to suspect anyone speaking Spanish in Arizona as being an illegal alien.
1	I was eight at the time. I'll read up and get back to you. Mind your manners.	It was these same gun control nuts that chose to intentionally not require private transfers to involve background checks.You missed the opportunity back in 1968, you have no room to gripe about it now.
0	Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.	That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4.
1	So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies.	Why do you talk past me so I feel like I'm eavesdropping on a post intended for someone else?
0	Not quite. To be more correct regarding government and guns, the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence.Our political philosophy is very clear on this:"that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" - Declearation of IndependaceYou have the right to try and revolt with violence. You don't have the right to win a revolt.	One of the biggest arguments against gun control is that if the government became too oppressive, the people wouldn't have the capacity to carry out a successful rebellion.
0	How is that a strawman? Your challenge directly relies upon something you assume to be proven, but has not been. Therefore even in a hypothetical stance, your underlying arguments are invalid, thus leading to everything else being invalid. You're not doing so well on this forum.	And where, pray tell are you pulling THIS strawman from?
1	Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity ).	How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God?
0	i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills.	there are many problems with society depending on which part of society one belongs to.
0	Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick.	This is not true.
1	Why not? My mother has been 39,for the last 39 years.	''No, actually the earth is 150 years old.
0	I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress. It's all politics.	So why, in this gun-hater's dream come true of congress, did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law?
0	Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.	And why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ?

0	are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire.	the size of mortgages is such that even a small rate change will push many over the limit of affordability.

0	Oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? They're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept.	Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring
0	walking-fish: has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10^23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe. what is it about science that you don't understand?	ok ill ask it in a different way has anyone obseved us evolving frmo monkeys?.....

0	Actually, there is no such thing as "an evolutionary mutation of a gene." A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?	An evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed.
0	Mythology. But nevertheless, shipbuilding has been going on for a lot longer than 500 years. There have been a lot of skilled shipbuilders who have passed along their knowledge from generation to generation. Do you think that every time someone builds a ship that they invent the whole process? Nah. 300 ft is about the limit for wood no matter how you design it. Even worse it you cast a big box adrift in a huge storm. How did the animals survive the rolling and rolling?	And you do realize that Noah was about 500 years old when he started the ark.
1	Amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term "light year."   If I am so ignorant, explain how your argument does not require exactly what I said: That God operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young Earth Creationism.   I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar.	The ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums, much less this ONE.

1	Um, Bassman, so you, the one person in the world who is as "pure as the wind-driven snow," is the one who may judge others, including Democrats. Um, for the record I grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of "wind-driven snow" and it was not particularly pure. A feeble and laughable metaphor.	Democrats are not clean and pure as the wind driven snow, they do not have an absolute birthright to govern, and they certainly are not the only ones qualified to govern!
1	btw, jazyjason, before you edited out your complimentary comment about howard dean. just wanted to say i'm surprised you said anything to associate yourself thus with a such an irrational far left commie. must stay with the mudflingers and lynch mobs and, especially if they're jesus lovers, ya know. so ... i understand why you took it down. merry christmas.	although i think it was feingold who said that obama has gotten the bill he intended to, from the beginning.

0	Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).	Would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity, mind, consciousness or existence in actuality?
1	Well, maybe the pistol and the hunting rifle, what do you need an automatic weapon? Have the deer gotten faster?	Now I think it does get a little extreme with owning several M-16s, but if I want to own a pistol, a shotgun, and some fancy automatic, well that's my right.

0	Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person.	My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, fetus, etc., is a Someone.
1	Where did you here this XXXX?Some cheap detective novel or something?Once again, my sincerest apologies.	Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever is left, however improbable, must be the truth.

1	Well, considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are, I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others.	So, when we believe the gospel, the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Christ's body, and our sins are forgiven through His shed blood.
0	Just curious, is it beyond you to make a post that includes common sense and logic? I'm thinking it is since all of you posts seem to be based on rhetoric and emotion. Three paragraphs and all of them contain a falsehood/ lie, congrats your batting 1.000.	Every time I see another story about another shooting in America, sometimes ever two or three shootouts and killings, it absolutely thrills me because I know that the NRA has armed even more Americans and more Americans can now go out and shoot and kill and maim.So, carry on, NRA!
1	Not true. I googled "helpful mutation" and got a nice list of examples. I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions.	The failure to observe even one mutation that adds information is more than just a failure to find support for the theory.
0	Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc...	I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old.
0	But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No.   Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No.	Marriage is to promote children bearing and making a family unit.
0	I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.	Is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax?

0	But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the "discrimination" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ... emoticonXRolleyesAnyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess.	Some Iowa county recorders say they have contemplated refusing to give a marriage license to gay couples who walk into the office, but so far none is vowing to do so.“This is putting us in a very, very difficult position here,” Wayne County Recorder Angela Horton said Thursday in an interview.

0	that explains why your politician can work together i bet your current government is made of a collation ? in the uk parliament we still have a first past the post system where the party with the majority form the government.  it is slightly different in scotland we have a hybrid system of pr and first past the post, the politics in scotland has changed slightly in fact the executive is made up of a collation between two parties. this has the effect of making our politics more consensual where parties can actually discuss and negotiation solutions without party politics and vote scoring.	very representational with a 4% floor concerning the national parliament (that is; you need at least 4% of the votes to be given mandates in the riksdag (national parliament))

0	i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?	i think your question should be 'why did god make commandments?'
0	No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God.	of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard "n" is right next to "b" last time I checked).
0	i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate. as for my personal take, 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that. do you disagree? prejean should not have lied about it. anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy. seeing some of hilton's work, i don't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody. i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about' is exactly why he was chosen.	wow, foundit is apparently quite the staunch anti-indecency advocate.
1	How about not clicking the "reply " button twice (heh,heh,) No, we didn't (Thank goodness) AND! PM Blair is recanting from the Kyoto protocol. Bully for him!	Yes, we've signed it, how about you?How about Iraq for not "respecting national autonomy"?
0	You only say that it won't make a change because you support the effects it will have.	You may have the right to keep and bear arms, that doesn't exempt you from being treated differently on the basis of your choice to do so, anymore than your right to free speech exempts you from being treated differently if you advocate segregation or paedophilia.
0	Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.	It's a good argument for doing away with the death penalty and their expensive trials.
1	Kill or be killed, survival of the fittest? No compassion, the rule of tooth and fang? WOW, color me impressed!	I suspect the correct religion is the one practiced by all non-humans on the planet.
1	So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.	creation is so easy to know.
0	well, signorile certainly didn't back up his opinions in this instance. how do you know it's the truth? if it were definitive, i'd be more inclined to agree. it's not 'common knowledge' that merv griffin was gay, at least not outside of hollywood. i'd never heard it myself. i don't see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were (like having sex with someone of the same gender).  and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 80s is absolutely opinion.	it may have been an opinion piece (as are all blogs), but he indicated he researched these facts for a book he had written.
0	The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc	I'm new to this idea that science has over-ruled Creation.
0	thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression.	so lets see how many other people are being targeted by the inquisition for their faith by the big three.
0	What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent.It's the woman's body that carries the fetus. It ultimately the woman's decision. As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion.	I'm sorry but the baby is a part of both of them.Should it be that the mother decides to keep the baby and the father want's her to terminate the state will still come chasing for child support.Why the father didn't get a say on if the baby was born or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law says so.
1	Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion.	I CAN EMPIRICALLY PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE GOD OF THE BIBLE VIA ITS CENTRAL CLAIMS
0	i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?	from now on, they should just fire all the judges and lawyers and let me decide.
1	Turned?  What do you mean turned?  (Oh man! Got you one more time! Brutal! lol)	guess i'll turn in now....beings that i've done turned nerd...
1	It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?	The laws are strictly enforce although they can still be beaten.
0	Now, now ZSU, we learned from comrade star gazer that GW created the Continental Army. I am sure these gentlemen have some equally illogical and inaccurate 'facts' to scatter around the barnyard emoticonXHoho	Ah the non human part.
0	And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology.	Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins.
0	No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system.	More concrete than the thought processes which dismiss out of hand the flat statement of the US Secretary of State opining that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, but allow them only to be lawfully held by the state?
1	If it isn't so hard then why haven't you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.	“Not that hard to figure out dude...What is your proof?”
0	do we want to have control over ourselves? some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. i dont know much on this matter, im only 14. but, ive been to a conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. its a narrow minded hellhole.	no i mean why not for people.
1	what did i previously tell you, i.e. well hey, moose, you're in a topic which highly relates to the bible. if you want a secular response there's plenty of those guys around. if you want to chat with me i'll usually be coming from a biblical perspective. but i'll be glad to talk with you on a secular subject if you want. what are you looking for? p.s. please hold your 'honest attempts at discussion' rants, ok? i could easily claim the same with you since you are out of god's wisdom. but i won't. what did you want to know? again, what did you want to know?	i say your interactions are not honest because you persist in these diversions, instead of directly answering with ideas that came out of your mind.
1	are you talking about this one??? he was talking about 'god'. he never said your 'god'. and i am both amused and bored by the fact that i just explained to you how evolution and a belief in a creator can co-exist, and you completely ignored it. but you're going to continue to claim that they are mutually exclusive, won't you...	did you not see the post by obvious child that i answered foundit?
1	This is great. You mean none of the Davidic line ever copulated with women to produce their descendents? LOL!	Which of course, , would not have made him the 'seed of david', because the 'seed of david' could only be through the unbroken male line (no women in the mix).
1	B.S. simone. He was the perfect age for Vietnam. Why hasn't he released his draft card? I know, they only sent them to citizens.	It wasn't necessary for President Obama to be in the military when he was coming up but he sure wouldn't have crapped out like George W. Bush and sent someone else to die in his place in Vietnam.
0	And if God was so against killing the unborn, why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn, why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women?I bet you won't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do. See my signature for examples.	He was declaring war on an unclean people whom He commanded the Jews to wipe out in a time of WAR.
0	I got ya, but I still disagree. if free will doesnt exist, then why should I make an effort to do anything? if I am destined to be wealthy, then no matter how lazy I am today, I'll be wealthy sometime down the road. and if Im destined to poor, no amount of hard work and diligence on my part can change that. why wouldnt I just drift along life and allow destiny to take me where I will inevitably end up?	I am sayin that salvation is not a choice.
0	He is a hell of a lot wiser than thee.	Let's just point out, as far as the article is concerned, just how many of your fellow Americans you're talking about.And what they must think about someone like you.
1	You do realize you just disproved your own basic points yes?   The pictures you posted are falsified because abortion clinics and small health clinics contract out to places to have their medical waste incinerated.   Good job on failing to realize you just proved Cunx correct.	Can you imagine the cost for every abortion clinic if they owned their own medical waste incinerator?
1	Actually, I read that the god of the bible was really a macaroni monster. He likes cheese, too.	It doesn't really connect to your comment, the whole Paris Hilton theory spawned from eating a whopper and trying to be a nuisance, both of which were highly successful.
0	john mccain is nothing more than another rino. he is the media's darling from the gop.	even though i am extremely liberal, i kind of liked mccain--until he kissed up to bush after bush and his people crapped all over him in south carolina.
1	You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.	You know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non-sentient life forms victims and referring to martin Luther King Jr. to justify their views.
0	Any belief system is a religion loosely defined. I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?	Your belief that a fetus deserves the same rights as fully developed people does.
0	think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is "wrong" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image	Since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect.
0	"He" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality. For some of us it's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day. But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists, it does nothing to lessen His reality.	No disrespect intended in that I agree with you in that "he" is real to you, just as Santa is to children whose parents told them there is a REAL Santa.
0	No, not really. All that is different is the number of steps.  What is YOUR definition of 'macro-evoution'? Is it speciation? Or is it a brand new genus?  We have observed speciation, where new species happened.	It may be perfectly legitimate to make these inferences, but the point of the statement from wikipedia  was that micro-evolution is directly and (more importantly) currently observable.
1	And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?	And when you're high, you're too ignorant and doped up to know that it's the marijuana that's making you act like a XXXXX.
1	I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?	I will not alter my foundational belief in marriage and family just because some cry for freedom at all costs.
0	Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems.	The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.
0	So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.	It turns out, the Johns Hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life.
0	First of all, it's not a precedent. this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional. Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called "lawlessness". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some "agenda" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us.	People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws.
1	That's nice, but have you ever thought of reading your own religion's Holy Book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that Jesus and his disciples said?	in Philly so I know my catechism...That is what is important to me..........
1	As usual, you shoot from the lip. I have no illusion of perfection, However I am convinced that as long as you live I will never be the dumbest man on earth.	I am sorry the only perfect man that ever lived was Jesus Christ and maybe you in your own mind
0	is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers.	no doubt that people who are determined to be anti-bush will always try and find something wrong with it, but i think bush's speech last night was very good.
1	What prompted this?  I guess I need to check what website I'm in...  Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. But, I've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.  But, carry on, Orion. You've shown your true colors now. Cluck at will... emoticonXChicken emoticonXRolleyes	you'll pardon me, please, if i view your response as that of an idiot or dolt.
0	So we should just say "god did it", and give up?	The fact is foundit, that creationists and I-Ders understand that there are so many unanswerable questions, so we know we can't answer them for certain, because Man just doesn't have the knowledge to discern the truth from the minutia.
1	Has the American Medical Association decided to recognize that aluminum, steel and polymer and addictive narcotic substances that can drastically alter a person's mental status?	What about a firearm junkie?
1	Primarily from your side of the aisle in all arguments. You really described yourself a T.	Sinjin, have you ever considered the problem of murky, misinformed, not to mention willfully ignorant, understanding?It seems to be something that one encounters a lot in these here precincts.
0	because it shows that your data is not absolute, and that there is supporting evidence for both sides? it also stops you justifiably saying things like... the data speaks for itself. in america, guns save more lives than are taken by them. fact. did you know that in the uk, i am statistically at least twice less likely to be killed than you? fact. it works both ways...	ha...what is the point of posting data if you are just going to conclude there isn't enough data?
1	you're kidding. just because your life is 'a fricken breeze' that doesn't mean the other 7 billion people on this earth have a breezy life. have you even watched the news lately? it's either that, or you live on another planet.	i don't know what people are complaining about.
0	Very true, especially since when someone asks "is there a God" they are most likely really asking "does the God in which I believe exist"	they could just as well not be there, and life as we know it would be the same.
1	3101 posts! what a waste of cyber real estate! at least you are brief.	Al Bore is nothing but a political opportunist to the Nth degree.
1	honestly did not know that acorn was such an evil organization that was based on evil-ness.  but really acorn seems like a very good organization based on helping those in need of help. i was under the impression of something totally different. i guess don't believe what you hear on fox news =]	http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/10/did_obama_lie_about_ayers.html  as for acorn... yeah, these guys look like real sons of bitches... everyone knows trying to help the poor makes you a radical commie.
0	And if the "natural process of evolution" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked?	So, when Miller says "I believe in Darwin's God", he is saying that God sustains the natural process of evolution and an intermediate agent.
1	You mean you don't think you have your own made-up religion?? How interesting! Do you really think you're fooling God? Or us?? Or even yourself??	Do you really think you're fooling God?
1	Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.	It's unparsimonious.You don't need absolute proof for something to be valid.
0	oh yes, the rhubarb is one of my favorites too. a fine choice..you get a cake emoticonxbirthdaycake	oh my how i love pie.
1	there is no problem in what you 'believe' in. science is irrelevant in many beliefs. just sole belief in a deity and his disciples, is what many religions revolve around. but, i am astounded by your god's name, no harsh feelings. a dragon lord king is quite a mouth full don't you say? can we just call em, greeble. :)	now, let us pray to the one true creator of the universe king greeble the dragon lord.
1	Now, that logic is so bad, it's worse than circular reasoning. It's figure eight reasoning.	God IS GOOD all the time and in the end God will win meaning creation beats evolution every time.
1	I guess the European union is a great failure? Is that why the Euro is trending 1.5 dollars as liberalism creats misery?	The idea is that Conservatism works every time it is properly implemented.
1	have you considered a career in advertising?  by the way you f***ed us too. Australians troops were cannon fodder in WWI for the British Empire, remember Gallipoli?	we gave you 'f*ck' too, but do you really think that 'australia: so what the f*cking hell are you waiting for' would be an appropriate ad campaign just because we started the word?
1	No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is "pro-evolution". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's "faith-based" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach	As for who plays 'word-games', it seems that you missed this... #19 "New peppered moth stuff"He went on for some time trying to undermine my posts based on the use of a word which most people have a problem with.There's also the problem with Darwin claiming a tautology was a better term than "Natural Selection", this was debated for some time, even though I posted the actual words of Darwin.The thread "Unto the Ages of Ages" developed into a debate over whether something could be both ''more accurate' and wrong, thanks Ursus!WJA and SLP argued over the word 'applied', then 'published'; whether Dembski had, and then changed this to 'proved' (see "Looking for intelligence" thread)Lurch/Ungerdunn etc over what is a 'noun'.
1	Hey, someone has to clean our toilets. This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education.	Families that embrace ID/Creationism are increasingly deciding that their children have no place in the "classroom".
1	are you completely incapable of making sense? penfold used deliberately obtuse language. this language was then explained to you. now you are arguing that 'turn the other cheek' is completely different, and in no way similar, to 'revolve/rotate' the other cheek. if you turn something, you revolve or rotate it. you're so busy being affronted by what people say that you come off as even more simple than they try to make you appear.	but for anyone to actually argue that penfold used clearly descriptive language in getting his point across, proves that you all are either too ignorant to know any better, or you're just taking this stance in order to stand against me.
1	And, let's see, when did the job loss actually start?   Oh yes.. We can trace the troubles starting in 2007, with a big melt down in August/September of 2008. Let's see.. Obama must have been a terrible president to have caused that.. oh WAIT. That wasn't Obama, that was BUSH.. Excuse Me.	It's the loss of non-government jobs that people don't like.
0	So was I. I did say I was playing devil's advocate. As far as I'm concerned, Tiktaalik is a triumph of scientific deduction.	I just was impressed that the fossil was not found by happenstance.
0	I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed. an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human. this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.	my opinion, their banning a gun because of the way it looks they seem to think an ak47 is worse than a regular gun because it looks like a military gun the only true (assault weapon) is fully automatic i have.
1	Did you even read ythe OP? Did you even read the title?   Pointless distinction? Huh.   I understand what you are saying. I also know you are changing your argument. When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it.	Either that or you're pretending to not get it.
1	And you wonder why people call "republicans" racist, women hating bigots. (hint: it's comments like yours)	The only reason Obama is even in office is because blacks are voting for a black man and free stuff, Hispanics want no borders, and most women don't know or don't care how bad the Obama liberals are digging America into the ground financially.
0	That's certainly your right, but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda, not a scientific one. He may want it disguised as a scientific one, but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire.	I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.
0	Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'.	It can certainly be a false theory, however, you can rationally show that it is or is not (to the degree determined by your evidence).
0	it is no "story"........i am debating on the whole evolution thing... look at the facts. so many great ppl, physics people, niels bohr, he was for evoulution, then he found out all of the facts that it is junk, so he became a christian	Is this a debate over the accuracy of the Genesis creation story or just a debate over the general idea that God did in fact create the world and it's inhabitants?
1	Hmm maybe I should take that one to a local patent office...	Glory holes in public conveniences is a gay invention not mine.
1	And, I'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker, right?	I would just want the woman to ask that question before she spreads her legs.Dono
1	So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws).   But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal.	How can you think that a baby that isn't born yet a nonentity?yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what "abortionist's" say is a load of ****!!
1	Is it not extremely cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not suffer from hypothermia due to the extreme cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not fall from the sky and break near all his bones when the wheel well opened for landing after a lengthy flight at 35,000 feet? Do I have to give you the flight number and type of airplane in order to get my stuffed animal circus prize?	For example, when and why did he die of hypothermia?
0	I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are.	They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) ...
0	How do you know carbon dating is so accurate? Would you bet your life on it?	Carbon dating is only accurate up to a point, and that point is WELL beyond creationism's statements.
1	Does this mean that you have finally repented of your multiple divorces??	[B]Let it not be said the grace of God for salvation in Jesus Christ is not freely available.
1	Another red herring gay argument. Ever hear of a medical power of attorney? You don't need marriage to have one, you know. emoticonXRolleyes	It's amazing that someone would list making medical decisions for a loved one who is unable to as a benefit.
1	Ahh, pointy tailed devils with pitchforks, more of your menagerie of divvels, demons, saints, angels, demigods, ghosts and other varied superstitious nonsense. Which of your gods created them, Snerdley?	That serpent, the devil, has been having his way with you for some time now.
1	Come on down to skid row with the rest of us 'lower class' I'll even buy a bottle of MD 20/20 on me.	Alas, I can no longer drink any sort of alcoholic beverage, although I used to love to drink the excellent foreign beers, high grade gin, scotch, brandy etc., in other words, sipping whiskey as opposed to the cheap raw stuff that the lower classes guzzle up.
1	oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.	Don't know about anyone else, but I don't think you have that much impact on our lives SS Who's more arrogant?
0	I know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but I think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has, what post number this is, how many are left, any comments concerning going outside the rules, etc.	Once the debate has begun, I will not make another post until the end.One week sounds reasonable - you might want to post within a shorter gap later on, but that will be up to the person posting.
0	What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking.	That's my claim
0	What possible concern is any of that to you?    Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon.	Do you believe that you will hear an understanding of God that you've not heard before, or are you of the belief you are open-minded on the subject, and might well have an epiphany?
1	Simone, read the sentence again please. It was "Saving lives is "not just" a Republican goal." It concerns the subject of abortion.   The only way it relates to the politics of Iraq, is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to "volunteer" their services for Iraq.   I can't let one statement you made go though. Terrorist continue to terrorize us? Where have they attacked in the U.S. since 9-11? Consider continuing this in an appropriate thread.	Saving lives is a Republican goal?Then, why have the Republicans condemned us to this ugly, nonproductive war in Iraq?The terrorists continue to terrorize us because we have deterred our efforts against them to Iraq, (and Bush intends to widen this nonproductive war into Iran and Syria) where nearly 700,000 Iraqis have been needlessly slaughtered, where more than 3,000 of our young have been sacrified in vain, and you have the audacity to say that "saving lives is a Republican goal.
1	your "minds"? How many do you have? Oh, and "I wanted to see what inferior it was"? Nice example of your supposed superiority.	Not because it could effect what was said (it was pointless to your position) but because I wanted to see what inferior it was.
1	'slaves, tortures, drones, dictators' hmm, what does that sound like? oh yeah, the history of most european countries, including germany.	america invaded more countries, today has less freedoms (patriot act and so on), of all countries in the world germany is the only one, that hasn't a 'shady' history, cause everything has been come to light and regretted.
1	Yet another of your posts that wouldn't pass the Turing Test...	If he had not, we would still be living in the stone ages.
1	French like turkeys even the yanks eat turkeys. What has a turkey got to do with the French voting No! By the way, why do you spell turkey with a capital T?	When I said that I heard commentators saying that Turkey and fears of globalisation were the main reasons for the French no vote, then the same posters who had earlier claimed that the French no vote was a vote against Chirac now changed their tune and said Turkey and fears of globalisation were reasons as well.
1	I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds.	So far there is no mechanism for an organism to grow wings when it previously had none.
0	then where do rights come from and how do you know they exist? i commented on the part i felt needed to be commented on.	anything granted is not a right, things that are granted are priviledges.
1	Very impressive how you argue science. Are your arguments science, or are they anger? When Dawkins argues it with his above statement, that Darwinism is as all-encompassing as God is stated to be in the Bible, is it really science, or is it religion?	I could claim that you sexually violate chickens…The absolute absurdity of this guys arguments is stunning and perfectly deserving of unabashed taunting....BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!
0	I think its actually the states job...the judiciary does need to overturn Roe v. Wade to get this done though...which doesn't mean it becomes illegal.	It's ashame that everyone keeps looking for the judiciary to do the legislature's work.
0	And I think that if I fall off a tall cliff, I'll die. Does that mean that gravity and science are either evil or incorrect?	( Now remember, people actually thought this way in the name of evolution and science!)
0	oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you "think" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.	The life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.
0	yeah even i have to agree you were making a joke. i may not agree with your stances on things, but i can see when you're joking.	and some people have no sense of humor and take everything way too seriously... which i find pathetic.... just sayin'
0	again, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. Please show me where it is anything than a belief. Evolution was always considered science. It used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. Until the "theory" of intelligent design does that, I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief.	Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance.

You are exposed to ultraviolet when you walk outside in the sunshine.Every chemical that they used is readily detected in interstellar molecular clouds.	In these experiments posted the scientist are stimulating the simulated environmet with chemicals.

1	Well, the pill has the ability to not let it implant, which "God" already cause for around 60% of its contemporaries. The pill doesn't destroy the "entity" at all.	The morning after pill has the potential to destroy that unique post-conception human entity.
1	Lemme guess, in real life you're a lawyer, correct? You must be because you're extremely hypertechnical to the point of absurdity. It doesn't matter what you call them, be it criminal or gang member of dope dealer or home invader, if somebody breaks the law then they're a criminal and it's as simple as that.Seriously dude, you're trying to get off on a technicality here. Like a lawyer trying to argue "Your honor my client isn't a prostitute, she's a female escort". Doesn't matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as, a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is.So which is Ripskar, do criminals have guns and are likely to shoot you in the face and kill you, or do they not have guns at all. It's one or the other, it can't be both.	Ripskar pointed out that gangs (criminals, but not necessarily burglars or muggers) tend to have guns.

0	My life was a gift from my parents, no more, no less. When i look in the mirror, i do not see an embryo. If someone gives you something, they have every right to take it away if they feel you are not suited to handle it, or if they had second thoughts. I would think this was ok if the baby was stopped in an earlier stage, but once its in its third trimester, you have no right to kill it.	There is absolutely no thought whatsoever in the baby, its all about "how can i live easier without this problem?
1	Here is yet another example of Duo holding other people's arguments to a higher standard than he holds his own. Duo, you said "Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity." Are you right? Anyone claiming to know age on these boards without evidence is insanity? Duo, if you are right, you are calling yourself insane. That's not going to help you out on the credibility meter. Perhaps you might want to amend some of you posts?	How can a 13 year old have served in the military for 46 years?Here's the full post
1	You apparently know as much about law as you do about science. You wouldn't be arrested for having someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant was a controlled substance and last time I checked, poppy and weed weren't cancer cures.	.and that's because the medical establishment has made it illegal to treat any disease in this country with anything other than FDA approved drugs or surgery.
0	Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened.	5) Show me one instance of an evolutionist (any book, any website) admitting that “evolution” may not be evolution at all, but simply an individual organism's ability to utilize his genetic diversity and adapt himself to his local environment – that selection may not have anything to do with phenotypic change....and instead of vertically, evolution first happens horizontally.
1	Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they, termites could assure that if properly used. After 40 days and more they would be ravenous.	And what did Noah do about the termites?
1	Actually what sank that debate was a bunch of paleontologists from K state who started arguing for punctuated equilibrium. That was pretty much the end. I remember one board member was quoted as saying "These are public schools. We are luck if we can teach the kids to read"	I would have to say that whoever told you about 'macro-evoution' from a science perspective obviously did not explain things properly.
1	So you're saying that God is a "respector"?-of-persons - iow, the mom's "more"-important to *God*? than the unborn.	I do not believe it is right, but the life of the woman is more important than the unborn,
0	Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)	There are many scientists that say this is true, but there are many more that say that it isn't
0	Well, in the sense that we cannot actually detect the intelligent design Behe proposes, then it it OUTSIDE the limit of actual detection.	The scientific effect involved is always at the very limit of detection.
1	You assume homosexuality is a "choice", with no evidence substantiating that position, until you have been shown evidence that it is genetic???And you claim to be a "scientist by profession"???LOLOLOLOL!While you're at it, maybe you can explain to us what a "unconscious choice" is...	I've yet to see any that prove gayness is hereditary, predisposed or anything other than an unconscious/conscious choice.
0	But my point is that the Supreme Court has disagreed. Hence the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process, which maintains that the due process clause can be violated even in cases where due process has been given.	Again, the 14th Amendment just keeps any state from depriving anyone of liberty-- it doesn't DEFINE that liberty.
0	Actually, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene. The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function.	I've been telling this board for months that the gene is not the player in biological change that everyone thinks it is.

0	No one mentioned helping or not helping people here, or even dealing with the consquences of pregnancy at all. Its more;'If abortion were banned, what measures or research would you suggest to reduce the pressure for people to have illegal ones or unwanted pregnancies'.	This discussion is kind of unrelated to abortion because a link between abortion being wrong and someone not helping another in need doesn't exist.
0	Well said. It is a disgrace that the "Flat Earth" side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the "Spontaneous Creation" side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects. Do you realise that they refuse to present the "Cheese" side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days? It's outrageous, how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue!	audi alteram partem or in English "hear both sides of an argument"....

1	so let me get this straight, you would violate a womans civil rights to save a fertilized egg, but have no problem killing real people? wow.	and again, while i know it does happen from time to time, how many cases can you provide as examples where someone was sentenced to death, and later exhonerated from all charges?

1	well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy ? because making abortion illegal sure will !	should we make incest legal?
1	Well, you got that one exactly right. I didn't bother to watch your video. It was pretty predictable coming from you - personal attacks on creationists. I quoted YOU because of what YOU said.	How you consider mathematical equations "mockery" I don't know, but more likely, you did not bother to watch the video.
0	Yes, everyone is a "potential" felon. Fortunately most people never commit a felony. And there are many different types of weapons, all which could be used by previously law abiding citizens to commit an act of violence.	In a moment of extreme stress, a previously law abiding citizen might commit an act of violence with his or her firearm.
1	There you go. It's difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of when the facts are the facts!	And secondly, it's a bit rich for them to call it murder when a blastocyst can turn into a tumour.And oncologists murder tumours all the time...

0	I agree, for the most part. Once you get to tanks and helicopters though? Too big, too easy a target for a tyrannical regime. Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters? I'm sure they could get them if they really wanted, but they're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers. Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines.	citizens would need to have machine guns, bazookas, shoulder launched missiles, tanks, blackhawk helicopters,
1	You're the one who needs to get a grip. Lots could get worse, but not for the reasons you're stating.   But I take it you're finally admitting that (actually) 50 million uninsured human beings who could die or go bankrupt is a big problem.	So making it much worse cures the problem.
0	do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security? most individuals exist from proceeds of a 'job' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other, of which they generally have no actual influence.  i find it difficult to accept that the average, individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on tv. voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit.	in my opinion, the issues most important to the individual person are the same as they have been for thousands of years.
0	You mean that it must have has a beginning, don't you?	Since the universe must have had a finite existence, it must have been created.
1	oh yeah you're right! i suppose only sane americans get guns! no wonder 0% of the population are killed in gun warfare. oh wait, a considerable amount of people are killed by guns. silly me! of course all the sane people can also shoot who they want in some states, just because they feel threatened by it. sure keep guns, advocate them why don't you. after all, all those people killed, and the families of those people.. hasn't happened to you, so why should you care?!?! (noob...)	the crazies that want to shoot up a bunch of people will still be able to get a gun.
1	The gentleman (??) in question has been presented the facts numerous times. He "pooh-pooh"s them as irrelevant. He places himself above scientific research. He doesn't know the difference between unsolicitated testimonials and scientific evidence.	It would be better to produce the facts over and again than it would by using the above tactics, Steve.
0	proof? and, i'm just surprised that brooks is actually capable of seeing where the problem lies. his solution? probably another dumb republican non-solution.	a 'faux argument' would be a pretend argument, like pretending you are an ardent pro-lifer, and making up terrible arguments, to make the pro-life position look ridiculous.
0	How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?	...but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!
0	You do have a problem with this person defending himself or you would not be attacking him. Fear made him do this. The fear was created in him by the buglers.   You want unarmed passengers to attack armed terrorists on airplanes, but you have a problem with a home owner killing buglers.	I have no problem with him killing them both.
1	NAAAAA, actually it makes ME sound quite sane...I'm not denying a woman the "right" to have sex all she wants. THere ARE ways of having sex WITHOUT getting pregnant, I'm sure you'd agree. SO, it actually makes YOU sound like you are desperately hanging on to the "right" to take an innocent life just because you don't want to be inconvenienced. In Bizarro world, you might be right, but not in reality	You really don't know how this makes you sound?
0	GREED but what you fail to admit is that that standard of living comes at a price for someone.	If the American system of government is so terrible, why do we have one of the highest standards of living on earth?
0	Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time.	That means that you have lost the discussion and you know you have lost.
0	So, because they don't interpret the bible as you do, they believe that there are no deities? That is what you said...	simple....many Christians have been deceived....just like Adam and Eve were deceived in the Bible.
1	First off, no one says that if there is evil, there can't be a God. They say that if there's evil, then God can't be omnipotent and all benevolent. Let's keep the topics straight. Also, I see no way in which the existence of good bolsters the argument that God exists. I could posit the existence of a God of popcorn, and then say "look, here's some popcorn, my God must be real!" Somehow, I don't think that would convince you.	Originally Posted by unkerpauliethe fact is that evil and good exist, and that we can by no means use the existence of evil to conclude that God doesnt exist, because by definition the existence of evil substantiates that good exists and therefore actually supports the argument for God

1	I though the torture was just a result of the number of wing nuts there were around the place.	4Forums is secretly run by the government for the sole purpose of identifying non-conformists and physiologically torturing them with a mind control device that lets them speak directly into your brain with high frequency radio waves, this device also allows them to read your mind.
1	He has a persecution complex. He thinks that every intelligent white male is out to put chains on him and make him sing Gospel songs. ;)	Perhaps you should admit to being mentally ill because at least that's not your own fault.
0	Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals.	Not owning a gun makes me safer and two cherry picked 911 calls does not disprove that.
0	now isn't that a terribly socialistic position to take? but, i'm confused by it at the same time, for socialists like you don't really want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now do you? emoticonxrolleyes when logic fails, there's alway ad hominem, right? and the ad hominen continues..... we're larger, more diverse, more litigious, need i go on? leaving the continued ad hominem aside, one of the causes for our high healthcare costs is litigation. since the dnc survives on the money derived from the blood-sucking trial lawyers lobby, i don't see real reform occurring until we cut those purse strings along with the big pharma's.	you don't even want to take the time to actually read the bill.

1	I see you know nothing about the subject...hardly a surprise.	So what?
0	i concede that it can go to a ballot. you have been arguing that such an issue should go to a ballot.  care to comment on the second point i made? to some extent this thread is about whether anyone should be concerned that all the petition signers realized what they were signing (in the context of proven wide-spread fraud on the part of the signature gatherers).	but whether or not it can go on a ballot is at stake in this discussion, and obviously it can.

1	Well, either the real or imaginary Phyllis implied those things in the post under discussion.	So here is the real Phyllis.I never said that you had to support anything.
0	Not the way I see it from my experiences. I let the readers decide on their own.	As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.
0	I believe that's true, and as a "believer" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be "with" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves "not with" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be "with" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.	Ironically, when I have publicaly advanced the idea that God is generally compatable with evolution, I find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas, but many believers are dumbfounded.
0	logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law. You can ban abortion is you want...the states did it and the constitution allows it, even if 5 legislatures think otherwise.	Why bother when you know logic, rational thinking and womens rights always take second seat to antiquated belief system dogma?
1	me whine?  this entire f ing thread is devoted to you whining. go cry to your mommy about all those big bad gay people picking on you and your poor little religion.	<flush> why don't you go whine to somebody who can help you out with that, then?
1	This is odd. You voluntarily participate in a Religion discussion forum - indeed, the frequency of your posting suggests that this participation occupies a substantial portion of your leisure time - but when someone presents you with the opportunity to demonstrate the validity of your position, you 'have better things to do'.	Sorry, I have better things to do than entertain this kind of folly.
0	Yes, they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods. You're an atheist, aren't you?	Atheism does not show 'faithful devotion' in any ultimate reality or deity.
1	wow, your sex life is based on relativity? i assumed you were quick, but not that bad.	no i am not single for any dates before you ask.
0	Yes, and George Dubya Bush and the GOP know it's unconstitutional.Would it really bother you so much if the feds recognized a Massachusetts or California or New York or New Jersey same-sex marriage while other states like Alabama and Utah could ban same-sex marriage?I could live with that. Most gay people already leave those states anyway.	It is Federal Law.
0	I see your point, Iangb but I'm not about to be leaving before you've had a chance to respond. I won't be "leaving" at all. You challenged me to produce an argument, so I'm going to produce my argument. I will then summarize the argument, and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with.Truthfully, this is how I should have first responded to your challenge. Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate.--Chuz	Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary).
0	And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?	The bottom line is that we should be free to believe as we believe while others should be afforded that same right.
0	Well, it might help if you could propose a mechanism for such changing traits that would stand up as well as the current model of genetic inheritance.	Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.
1	...or we could feed the criminals to the dinosaurs!...save the cows for meatloaf.	You really have a rather macabre streak in you, Jim.
0	But wouldn't it make it more likely that a gun dealer that was involved in gun trafficking would be audited and caught by the ATF? If there are less FFLs then the ATF has more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer.	It has had no effect on the criminal use of guns and no thinking person would have predicted that it would.
1	I also took a look and think your evaluation is charitable.	I have already seen your site.
0	That's certainly an interesting point. I know next to nothing about global economics, so I won't try to argue here. But I will make a guess that such a thing will never happen as long as we're still a superpower and cling to our beloved dollar. Probably we'll devolve into just four or five major currencies in the next 50 or so years and leave it at that for a long while.But to stay on topic, I'm just wondering why such a thing was brought up as a Sign of The End. Why would it seem evil to someone living back then? It's an oft-quoted religious statistic that always leaves me scratching my head.	I mean, if we where all to have the same currency there would be some really daunting economic implications when we experience local or regional demand or suply shocks for example.
1	Well, it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution. One doesn't expect Creationists to possess it.	I have believed that God created everything 'in the beginning' for as long as I can remember.
1	i don't see why not. if somebody is perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they'd hesitate if it meant crushing a skull with a bat rather than just shooting them in the face. seriously, what kind of stability are you dealing with when all it takes to motivate someone to murder is a simple question? a baseball bat isn't concealable like a handgun, is it? nor can it be readily used by someone suffering arthritis or used in a cramped location. any weapon can be used to inflict death and murder. the human body is hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near-indestructibility. even sneezing wrong can be potentially fatal. certainly not. do you see a contradiction?	do you think mr. bledsoe would have wound up dead if the perps had been carrying baseball bats  and he had said, youre not going to hit me with that thing?
0	quite frankly,i am astounded by you homosexuals (or homosexual supporters) who claim to hate judging yet judge religious people.....those who judge and those who don't... if i were to say a controversial statement such as 'whats the point of entering an exit?' you would have been hurt or angered..yet you would make disrespectful,hatred-provoking comments that was quite the opposite of the message you were spewing just arguments prior to your comment.	more accurately it preys upon their dumbness.
0	I may be a pro-gunner but what doe's that have to do with with gay rights?   Since I'm a pro- gunner I won't force my life style or views on you,if you don't force yours on me.Deal?   After all you seem to be the expert on gay rights.	it probably would have been better if scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court, 'there certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the second amendment and i, as an amateur historian, am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others.
0	Simply pointing out that swords cut in both directions.   Be that as it may, no one has refuted that there are more cases of Concealed Carry Permit holders who have gone off and assaulted people than there have been school shootings.   Care to try? Omegaman tried, failed, and went silent on the topic.	you're like a 500 lb guy pointing to a guy who's just barely even chubby and saying 'you're fat!'
1	Ok, EF, so am i likely to win the lottery before i meet an alian?	The law does not say that you will it says that you "likely will.
0	i'm kind of amused by the idea that the king james version is the most accurate, there are a lot of fairly well documented flaws, like the introduction of unicorns into the old testament. you also seem to imply that modern translations were dreamed up by a couple of drunken biblical scholars with nothing better to do on a friday evening, whereas most are at least as rigorously researched as the kjv, and often with a greater number of sources available.	my reason for this is you said... if the verse were from the old testiment, it wouldn't matter that jesus can come in and perfect one's heart because they didn't know who jesus was.
1	I guess he was a "democrat" as well. He certainly would not have been a republican.	Jesus had a lot of uncomfortable things to say to the rich and powerful.
1	It also isn't a baby yet either. It is called a fetus.	Are you saying you should be able to kill a baby 2 inches from being born if you wanted?
1	Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile.	Humans attempt to create new species, such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers, but these "NEW" species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves.
0	In my reading of the Declaration (and using the 1st. Amendment as a filter) it doesn't matter who or what the founders meant by "Creator." The conlusion is the same; regardless. Namely; The fact that the founders considered our basic rights to be inherrent.	More importantly, who do you think the authors of the Declaration considered the Creator to be?The Declaration certainly seems to tie up the notion of 'inalienable rights' with religion.No more, I'm going to bed.
0	But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural.	A fairer comparison for science as a whole would be the inner way of thinking and knowing, as contrasted to that based on external empiricism.
0	the top 10% of people in this country pay 67% of the taxes. most of the money from the middle class? no, not at all.	the big problem is that most of that tax money neither goes towards the needs or the wants of the american people, and all the tax money is coming from the middle class.
0	In your first post. If you are to qualify that by stating I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life over the ontogeny of an individual then of course reproduction is not essential character of life.	I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life
0	You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.I have to say that is false. We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. In addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up. So sorry, but you struck out.	Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible.
0	i simply quoted to you your own scripture, ez. how is that construed as bashing? de 21:20-21 and they shall say unto the elders of his city, this our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die:  mr 16:17-18 and these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.	now orion, there you go trying to bash someone else's religion when you still have not been able to document who your god is, where it lives, and be able to substantiate your beliefs with anything other than a feel-good whim.
1	let's see if i understand you correctly, because i think you may be on to something incredibly insightful. let's see, the island with males and females, uh, can reproduce, and, ... uh,  eureka, i've got it!!! you need a male and female to sexually reproduce!!!! that's ingenious!!!! you're brilliant, cool spot!! you're forgetting one thing. the island without the gay guys would not be nearly as fabulous.	but i'm guessing what you mean is if the gays died off and the straight island had it's resources destroyed then the island itself would be worse off, but i was talking more about the people's civilization, not the island itself.
0	Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. The reason I say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. Kinda just says that there are other people out there.	I know, sounds like incest, and today that is what it would be.However, you need to remember that there were no exact set of laws at the beginning of the creation.
0	Well, I didn't really mean to go that far. But I'm talking about problems like that all worked out, thought about previously, and that the problem was worked out. I'm talking more about, what if you could make laborers stronger, scientists smarter, and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome, narcolepsy, etc.). I don't think of making everyone the same for that reason. I'm just saying, what if there was a way to better society without going overboard? If the problems were worked out, which I'm sure they will be, what would your moral view on it be?	Therefore, this society purposely grew humans who were at different levels (some very mentally deficient) to supply a distributions of people who could fit the distribution of roles necessary for society.Therefore, on an individual level, I don't have much of a problem with genetic engineering (assuming that we really fully knew what we are doing, which is doubtful since many unforseen side effects could occur).
1	What part of "I don't want a penis" do you not quite understand?   Is it that maybe you are the one who wants a penis? There are ways to resolve that issue. emoticonXRolleyes	And trust me, there is no man who could ever make me feel the way she does.

0	I see. So you can't give an example of a dinosaur being dated with carbon 14. None of us thought you could.	here's one.........there's more.keep your silly lollipop.
1	Do you need faith to know the sun will rise tomorrow or that 2 + 2 = 4 or to know that if you drop a rock it will fall to the ground?	You have to believe that the scientists are unbiased, etc.
1	Ah, the esteemed Washington Times, the rag of that Korean Reverend who does the mass marriages and other weird stuff--um, what's his name now?	She will not garner the support of the necessary moderates.
0	If you think that it's OK when the Mother's life is in danger. Why wouldn't it be OK when her life isn't in danger?	I do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother's life is in danger, otherwise they should live with it.
0	I did not say that evolution precludes God, all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God. If a person does not beleive in God, then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality.	Others do not believe God exists.
0	no base for calling it a human being? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being. Seems you have no basis for saying I can't call a fetus a human being.	The thing is, you have no base for calling it a human being or giving it the same rights as us.
0	That seems unlikely. He gets banned everywhere he goes with his multiple names. He's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing XXXXXX that you get frequenting these boards (I can't say I blame him on the latter point).Look around the web though and you will find him elsewhere...	Just try not to get banned this time.
0	Sure they matter. But that isn't the issue here. You posted this in the abortion forums as if this medical malpractice which is taking place in an impoverished third world country is justification for it in America. That is a ludicrous and totally bogus argument to make.If you thought rationally, you would have it in the health forum and be complaining about how third world countries are so ill prepared for this common problem when we have the technology so readily available to avoid it. My Lord simone, a simple C-Section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby. But you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution. It makes no sense at all, and yet you post it thinking that you're contributing something rational. Go figure, huh!!! emoticonXFrazzled	So, Archie, nothing matters if it is outside of America?
0	Now everyone will know Marc was right all along--that there is an atheist science conspiracy.	I have no idea where people get the idea that scientists make things up without having good evidence behind it (oh wait… we're out to disprove God because all scientists hate God or some XXXX like that).
0	So, the Supreme Court rested its decision not on the 9th Amendment as the District Court had done, but chose instead to base it on the 14th Amendment.	This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.
0	I posted two versions:1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated due to "miraculous" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source.	My response was to your question "Can religious views be logical?"
0	Please note that I added the word "human" to your comment above IANGB. After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / "persons." Agree? Also, I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights (life) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have.	As hinted by the title, the general context of this thread is how the statement relates to the rights of a zygote; we may end up branching out into that area, but the statement is the starting point.
1	Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata.	I know what I'm talking about.
1	well, then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells? what's their reason then? we don't know, because the doctors might not want everything that they're doing be on the front page of every newspaper. they have their reasons for their actions, and they just don't want people like you to know about them. or...they already have their reasons published and everything and you're just 2 close-minded 2 take the information in.	If it was anybody I was choose adult stem cells.
0	Yes that is a problem. But there is an instance when the 2nd Amendment did protect the USA from invaders:"Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland US forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast" - http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob70.htmlIf it wasn't for the 2nd Amendment you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the West coast, German if you live on the East coast.	This is so inane I dont know where to start.Firstly - If there existed an armed forces capable of destroying the US military, then an armed civilian population would be absolutely no barrier to them.Secondly - There is no single nation on earth that can move 200,000,000 men.Thirdly - How exactly do you propose China get its men to the USA?

The only way to make a country crime free is to get rid of laws, which would just be ridiculous.
1	I have no problem with them preaching against gays in their churches and the privacy of thier homes. Its when they crawl out from under their rocks that I have a problem. I also have absolutly no problem what so ever with them talking about Jesus if only they would keep to the subject of Jesus and leave all gay issues alone. Unfortually Paul has replaced Jesus in many churches.	Like I said, you are for persecuting religious people if they don't agree 100% with you.
0	the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the "greatest possible being". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. "greatest" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that existits like "the oldest man alive". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence	It is equally foolish to say that "If England exists, then it exists in all possible worlds."
1	He stated that " statistics show that firearms cause aggression in individuals", no mention of the word can anywhere in there that I saw.	We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun.
1	Oh boy,,.. I got ignored with a potty remark. Why is that not surprising?	You're a misguided individual, Trebor.Time to place you on Ignore.<Click><Flush>
1	You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated. People will have abortions legal or not legal. At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger.	Just out of interest, which particular aspect of "truth" are you getting at here?
1	Demolishing your "rebuttal" in post #14 does, however. You missed it.	Incredibly enough, ignoring my rebuttal doesn't make you right.

[5] putting your family in all that danger because youre nuts about guns is immoral
0	So, this statement is from a 'law center' that is dedicated to defend the religious freedom for CHristians. Yet, this isn't about 'religion'. Why do I find that hypocritical.	The center, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, lobbies for what it sees as the religious freedom of Christians and is defending the school district.
0	Thats an odd analogy. Can a child survive without its mother? I'd say a baby is no less dependent on its mother the first few years than it is when in it grew in the womb.  Is the child still a parasite then?	We don't see a fetus as a parasite, but that essentially what it is.....
0	That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4. Did our bodies once produce Vitamin C?.	For example, our gene for vitamin C is broken and no longer works.
1	if you want more downs syndrome children entering the world, why don't you take care of them? what have you ever done for these children? oh that's right, you'd rather just sermonise about how 90% of people are 'hard-hearted'.	sorry if i sound harsh, but honestly this statement only sounds to me like you are convicted and you dont want anyone else to be willing to take care of disabled children so that your conscience would be clear not to as welll...
0	Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings.	Why hasn't natural selection weeded out species with their inferior "optical vision" and given them all echolocation, which would allow them superior senses in day and night, rather than just daytime?

0	But the responsibility does not end with the woman who experiences the pregnancy. If it did, then men would not be required by law to pay child support.	And ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.

0	Today's students are tomorrow's scientists. They are unlikely to study something that, if they hear about it at all, they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origins of atheist evolution. To reduce ID to other classes like literature or social sciences, etc. (where poetry, fiction, and prehistoric beliefs are the subject matter) is nothing more than a clever, dishonest attempt to belittle it.	But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution.
1	So a gun is a fire hazard in a public place? I gotta say the gun haters are getting more creative with their arguments.	Practices such as loyalty oaths and fire safety ordinances were common place in colonial times and could be regarded as restrictions on the bearing of arms for effective self defense.
0	see what i mean, and there are 2 f's in d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n-t, dearie.	do you ever originate a post and talk about the subject of the thread or just attack people who have a diferent opinion then you do?
1	Lets all make vast generalizations that are not true. Seems fun emoticonXRolleyes	They are just religious fundamentalists.
0	The difference, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done, has been given much thought and study. The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men, until, the fait accompli has been established. If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment.	I can understand the argument that gun laws may infringe on some individual freedom, but I don`t really understand what the constitution has to do with it.
0	Hmm, when you say "numberless" do you mean something other than the standard definition of infinite? If not, please explain how an infinite number of organisms could be created in a finite time with finite space and resources. Thank you.	If it happened they would be numberless just as Darwin said...
0	Things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years. Or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process. Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range, any time during those billions of years.	You're going to have to be more specific about what 'stopping evolution in its tracks' means.
0	And the loss to society because people used guns instead of an alternate weapon is?	A lot more people would be alive today and others not sitting in prison for crimes they commited.
0	The only person who can take away your sin is God. No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins, so get over it.	And to think that the God in question needs someone to acknowledge their presence as their lord and master before this all covering evil falls away,
0	The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan. It does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought. This is where your mistake lies.	There IS an intrinsic, inherent item of biological evolution that ISN'T scientifically valid and that could well be responsible over time for the eugenic-mess we've seen over the years.Evolutionary theory itself preaches and teaches No-Teleology-No-Conscious-Forethought.
1	You can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. That not how it should works.	No one would be forced to have one.

1	I think we should not only allow GAYs to have legal marriage rights but also those who want to practice insist as well as all who want to practice polygamy. Let us not stop there let us sanction union between human and animals. After all I love my Dog and my Parrot. Why stop with GAYs?   By the way where does the term GAY come from for homosexuals.	If the town halls are inundated with requests then it will send a message that we GLBT people as a whole will not tolerate being made into 2nd class citizens
0	How the heck does darwinism get one out of poverty????I think you are generalizing by lumping ALL education into the specific areas that some religious conservatives oppose. If they opposed getting degrees, going to grad school, etc., I could see your point. But I don't know of any religious sect that opposes that.	What I see as an important mechanism to get out of poverty is education.
0	Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that "informed" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution.	Today, no informed creationist would deny natural selection.
0	I believe the question was "who?"I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now.	"He formed us from the dust of the earth...." Why wouldn't He put something else, like we evolved....don't argue that they wouldn't be able to comprehend that kind of science back then because you are limiting the ability of God.......
1	you kidding? ez can't see past the front of his cobwebbed skull.	hey speaking of clueless, what would you call the rather significant increase in the percentage of wealth for the top 5% over the last couple decades?
0	If you paid attention the BATFE said so.       Yes but some people don't want to close the borders. They prefer no border controls.	You complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this?Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?
1	But did you consider it relative when you posted this on another thread?:	I think it is only logical as an atheist to say that evil is a relative term and thus does not truly exist.
1	i love how iranian president alphabets kidnaps 15 sailors and marines, holds them captive on bs evidence, and then trys to act like the biggest humanitarian on earth by 'pardoning' them out of the kindness of his heart. personally, i think it would be nice for these 15 british troops to see the bombers going the opposite direction as they leave iranian airspace.	somehow i knew when i posted it that your delusions would try to find some sort of way to criticize me even if i just stated a simple fact.

0	Hardly any criminals go armed in England, and certainly not with guns. Burglars and muggers have enough sense to know that while getting done for burglary or mugging will not be pleasant, getting done for burglarly or mugging AND possession of a firearm will be far, far worse, assuming they survive the arrival of the armed response squad.	And without a gun you're defenseless, why can't you seem to understand that?How many cases have there been of a person having their personal firearm taken right out of their hands by a criminal, never to be seen again?Nobody's armed in England, but the criminals still go armed.

0	Actually, what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else. Denying the right to marriage because of his/her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens. The supporters of the anti-gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public, the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it. Ever read John Locke or JS Mill? You should, it's what our country ideals are based on. You have your bubble and I have mine so just leave me alone; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs.	Actually I think that what a lot of the 55-60% of the country who oppose gay marriage find, is that if they join an internet site, that they will be viciously attacked by gay marriage supporters.
0	do you mean when pelosi said the protestors had nazi banners, when they were actually banners saying 'no' to nazism? she's in the democrats. you mean the fantasy land whitehouse version of the proposals, that no one has actually read? no one that understands the constitution would say that, that's a very ignorant comment. what's perverted is that you think freedom of speech means the people have to shut up while they listen patiently to the government propaganda machine.	when the party of opposition promotes lies and fearmongering, then denies those who attend townhall meetings an audience with their elected representatives, and the opportunity to hear the actuality of the proposals, then that impinges on freedom of speech.

1	Dear Hypocrite,  Do you wish to be a competent poster and actually respond to questions and requests? If so, please answer my request (on the other thread) and I will be happy to answer your questions.	intent: 'design, resolve, or determination with which a person acts' meaning: 'that which is intended to be, signified or denoted by act or language' see, you silly goose, they are one and the same.

0	If I want "people" to think? Kronos, the only one here who's making a big issue of whether or not I state the obvious here is you. You're the one making a big deal of it here. In a case where it's blatantly obvious, as in this one, then obviously there's an issue of homophobia here.	Then I guess you haven't been paying much attention in our last few conversations.
1	I wonder if I can convince a judge that all other legal documents should be read in an "enlightened" way. I can perhaps get out of contracts and speeding tickets if I just show them the light and error of their ways!   Your supercilious post amazes me.	Actually, if the Constitution had been read in an enlightened way
0	That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory.	No, because 2+2= 4 if you agree with it or not.It's a concept that is not dependent on man to agree with it.
1	WW, are you talking to yourself?If not, then please learn how to attribute statements to the person who made them.	That's materialist/mechanist ontology in a nutshell, and so that's exactly what you do believe!
0	not that i was interested in joining them, but i did read the two links. i'm not much surprised that science has nothing to do with it...and not at all surprised that many actors are into it...hollywood has long been known to generate kooks. i suppose they are just a small portion of the total, but they are very publicized.	a tongue in cheek and maybe even true look at scientology: http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/scientology/
0	This applies only when men strive...that is fight. If a man "Accidently" hits a woman while in a fight and causes her to lose her child then all he has to do is pay a fine. But if he keeps fighting and hurt other people he gets killed. Even in the Bible you dont get punished so severly on accidents.	"If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
0	But still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.What debate are you trying to end here? The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?	The purpose of hte bill of rights is to recognise certain pre-exisitng rights, but specifically NOT to curtail any that are not specifically recognised.
1	BOY-HOWDY!!!!! You have spoken the truth and spoken it well. Welcome to you from the conservative South.	I personally believe that abortion is murder of a defenseless, innocent, unborn infant in the womb and should not be legal unless the mother's life was endangered or possibly in the case of rape and incest........I believe it is the most barbaric act one human being can perpetrate on another........
1	so you agree simple foreknowledge is not determinism in the way i explained it? if so, can you explain that to electrolyte, who is having a terrible time coming to grips with that? he has omnipotent foreknowledge about future events, is the way i would put it.	ez, you are still arguing against foreknowledge causing an event, something i, time and time again, have explicitly stated is not the point i am making.

0	"Usually, "rationality" is a Humpty-Dumpty word, that means whatever the user finds is convenient to club his opponents with."http://world.std.com/~mhuben/skept/rationality.htmlKnowledge itself is a limited commodity. To make a claim that everything is knowable is a statement that is impossible to prove; Scientism makes this claim. Closely related to it is Objectivism."Scientism, in the strong sense, is the self-annihilating view that only scientific claims are meaningful, which is not a scientific claim and hence, if true, not meaningful."http://skepdic.com/scientism.htmlRecommended Reading:"Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time" by Michael ShermerNot only does it include creationism, :) but also the philosophy of Ayn Rand (Objectivism)	You can believe in it, but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief.

0	And melting the entire surface of the earth and boiling the oceans. Even creationist who propose the nonsense that you spout admit that they have no way to explain where the heat went. In an effort to answer where the water went, they encounter the problem of explaining where the heat went.	The flood opened waters of the deap splitting the contenints and begining the drift.
0	Again, you are the affirmative, you must support your claims. Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition. I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition, which is a neutral one.	That's true, but how much have we actually learned, and how much have we theorized, with an atheist presupposition, the only presupposition currently allowed?

0	pro-choice is only pro child if the choice is not abortion and they are only pro family when the choice for family. So really pro choice can be pro child or anti child and pro family or anti family.	Pro choice is pro child is pro family.Having access to contraception and to abortion if contraception fails or for other reasons strengthens the family.
1	you do know that it is a) easy to register and b) the site admin is a christian, don't you? you won't go there because the moderation is strict about sticking to the topic and insults. these things seem to be part of your weapon load out, here.	what amazes me is that you all scoff at creationism, yet this is the best most of you can offer to refute scientific evidence which supports the flood.
0	Kent Hovind is a slimy, uneducated, hack. His only education past high school is a degree from an unaccredited bible school. He is also a liar, since I just can't believe that anyone could be so stupid to say some of the things that he does. Of course, there are other people that are so stupid that they actually believe him.	The Big Bang was proved wrong years ago by Kent Hovind.
1	you're joking, right?!?!?! you really believe books, teachers, computers, etc. are more important than a hungry child whose parents cannot afford to pay? wow...	money used by the school district to pay for free lunches for students is money that could have been spent on more important things like books, teachers, computers, etc.
1	Please tell me, why did you believe your pastor, but not me? What did he say that was so convincing? And please, PLEASE, tell me what you think the Bible might not be saying that could have any bearing on this in the slightest. How can the fact that we don't know Ehosh's second cousin twice removed have any bearing on this at all, or whatever you think the Bible wasn't saying?	His main point to me was that although we know that the bible doesn't give a complete genealogical record, where it does, it is reliable.
0	They are not exactly the same. See the examples above. It is not random.	In contrast, evolutionists laughingly look at the miniscule differences between individuals of a population and dare call those who survive the "fittest" -- when actually, since each member of the population is almost exactly the same, the "fittest" are actually just the luckiest
0	'if it's beside the point' the why bring it up, jyoshu. why 'talk out of both sides of your mouth'?  and your right wing talking points are stale and tired. comparing different civil rights movements is not 'piggybacking'. and incidentally, why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people. there are female gay people that suffered along with the women. on top of such discrimination, gay people may have had no family support. some were probably lobotomized against their wishes. some were raped, some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about. no, my friend. it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not.	that is beside the point--it is still the civil rights of black people that gay lobbyists often try to piggyback off of.
1	go back to the part in which we were discussing a specific case and stop trying to encompass the universe in your justification.

0	Mayabe this is a miniscule amount of suffering compared to what awaits you on the flipside. Weather it be an eternity of Bliss or agony and suffering. Who really knows. Mayabe those who have this happen to them have it coming to them?	DNA dating pretty much gives the same time for common ancestors as fossils do.There is really no difference between carrying out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observing it than millions of years - other than the latter makes it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime.Science is the current sum of human knowledge about how the world works.Never get published thoughThere is a massive amount of evidence that points to things being designed via evolution rather than a concious designer - there are massive amount of badly designed organs and organisms, either God is spiteful or incompetant.
1	LoL What part of a Binding Document, the Constitution with it's Bill of Rights, don't you understand!   You demand that we obey the law, but you would allow Government to break the Supreme law of the Land, and you call me a nut? I gotta say my friend, THAT is truly nutty! emoticonXSmilie	Even gun nuts should possess enough gumption to know that an internet petition isn't worth the paper it isn't written on.
0	Little boy, you need to do a little study on Nazis. They specialized in death. Unlike pro-life people.	The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league.
1	Somebody needs to check his Little Golden Dictionary. "Random" and "selective" are antonyms. To say that selection is random is to admit ignorance of the English language.	I have no idea what mechanism/explanation you favour wrt biological evolution, but if it is the Random, spontaneously generated, coincidental to organismic need, plus local, accidental, cull by chance environmental factor "Natural Selection" notion, then here's a surprise alert for you--you believe in a notion that is intrinsically and essentially chance-based, that is, a notio9n that not only involves random accidents, but one that involves nothing but random, local, and anomalous accidents.
1	Good lesson! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions. Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you...you should just casually drive away. Thanks Simone!	It was not an easy decision for her to make but she made it and it's well in the past, except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it.

The sun went around the earth,... the earth was flat ?? Theres no one but us .. It was all created for us??Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something. I think I'm going to be sick!! Back in a few.	MM I am usually with you on every issue but we part company on this one......There have just been to many credible people who have had sightings.......Maybe they are light years ahead of us in the technology of space travel...............Can you imagine what they could teach us if they made contact?
0	If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS (or some other legally recognized union) as married couples, why does it matter which "door" they come in through? They get all the same benefits, including the benefits that come when one partner dies.What's the beef...except that you can't say that you're "married"?	Mamère claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony, and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights.French Justice Minister Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void, and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.Same-sex marriage in France - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWhat France has is "well, both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side-door, but only the whites can enter by the main door"We wouldn't find such an "acommodation" satisfactory for blacks.And furthermore, I think you would find that it's the ANTI-GAYS who have the problem with this.If Obama is able to try to put up "civil unions" on the federal level, you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him.Not the gays...
0	From my first post, starting with the quote from the religioustolerance website;	You are going to have to explain what happenstance origins are, becase as said earlier, I couldn't find any definition from any of the dictionaries I searched, and all I get from google is a theology forum and a 101 contradictions to the bible.
0	I know a bit about this myself.  However the difference is that I was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute. An Armed person truly cannot be bullied! The old saying is. God created man and Samuel Colt made them equal! Old, disabled, female and all, are on an equal footing with these vicious predators!	A Leicestershire Police log shows that she called them more than twenty times in seven years to say that her severely dyslexic son's life had been threatened, her daughter, who had acute special needs, was being bullied and her house was under attack from the gang of youths.
0	Because the modern application of gun control is to target everyone. But that doesn't change the fact that gun control began as a purely racist concept.	If gun control is truly racist then it's a wonder that the courts in areas with strict gun control laws haven't been flooded with claims of violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.
0	I do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define ALL abortions as either right or wrong. In between, there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong. Why limit yourself to the extreme views? I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. After all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with. However, the question of people's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights. Really ... what other question is more relevant?	Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong.
1	yes..but what is the difference between killing for fun and killing by mistake???? you drive your big suv to work every day...how many animals do you accidently kill? how many insects? oh wait, you judge a life by how big the life is...ignorant humans!	on the other hand people will understand that they must take care about animals.

1	i'm not 'claiming victory' after going off track to an unrelated topic. what i am addressing is related because i am saying it is irrelevant. how is that not related? in fact, this is another example of you changing the subject matter. to point out that they are irrelevant. i thought that was clear.	if you dont want to address the arguments then that is of course your perogative.
0	i think that's an excellent question. since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, i can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings.  there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research. since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, i'm not surprised with the claims made. here's a relevent story.	what do you think is motivating these scientists to lie to us?
1	ummmmmmm, because it was built in 1932-1935, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the founders or early government leaders, nor with what they believed was correct? you really are the master of the art of self-pwn, archie.	if the founders and early government leaders believed that the modern liberal interpretation of separation of church and state is correct then why is the image of moses carrying the ten commandments carved into the supreme court building?
1	another question that shouild be answered is . . . if the bible says that noah and a few members of his family were the only ones to survive this 'global' flood, how come there are so many other accounts of others surviving a flood? did god miss the target (that being the whole of humanity)? genesis 6:13 (new international version) 13 so god said to noah, 'i am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. presumably he also knew from the beginning of time that he was going to make this great big ####-up. how embarrassing!	in order to be considered as evidence of a global event, all of them must have happened at the same time.
0	okay, at least you gave an example for reagan. i personally think the russians were on the decline long before the end of the cold war, and reagan happened to be president when they finally fell, but we can agree to disagree. for bush i hope you're joking, because it has been quite clear that his policies have more than likely created more terrorists than he has helped defeat (not to mention the numerous other bad things he's done as president). in fact the only really good thing that came out of bush's presidency was that his unpopularity paved the way for obama to become president.	reagan because he ended the cold war.
1	Enlighten me. What evidence came out Monday, Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of this week?	As in, it's against the law to lie about someone in print and present it as truth.
0	It's probably defensive to some extent on both sides. A lot of atheists I've run into seem to be out to prostlytize as well--they are basically evangelists for the atheist way of thinking. Religiously atheist, you might say. They're looking for opportunities to assert the atheist message. And I've read some pretty darn hateful things said about Christianity right here in these forums, and just chalking it up to be "defending" or "kicking back" doesn't really fly. Who knows who threw the first punch? It's to the point that it doesn't really matter anymore, because both sides should be showing respect.	Our issue is only based in the fact that we are a normal part of society and would very much like to have that respect.
1	It's a real mess, though you've to got to give them points for originality.	I thought their reasoning was quite bizzare.

0	This is exactly what I said in a pm to her. I also suggested that she talk to women who have had abortions, who have not, who have had adoptions, and who have been adopted. I wish there was some kind of "place" you could go to automatically get this kind of dialogue. Not internet sites, but face to face stuff.Want to start a counseling center? :)	maybe you can postpone it one more week and think about it for one more week, and talk to others that love you (your boyfriend does not count).In the event you keep your appointment on Saturday, all I can say is I'm sorry, that you have to go through this event.
1	what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno	and yet you continue to support the illogic of a potential person having the right to make a slave of a person in being.
1	I believe that the theory you speak of is called slavery; everybody is equal because they have nothing and need to work long and hard just to earn the privilege of living in order to serve their masters.	rich people can take away poor peoples freedomthats why marx was so importanthe showed us that goverment can be the great equaliser because if only government owns property then nobody will be rich and we will all be equal
0	Actually, Galileo wasn't killed. He was sentenced to house arrest. And his sin was in declaring that the earth moved since the Bible states that the earth doesn't move.	Gallileo was killed because of blasphemy of the church, saying the Earth goes around the sun.
1	what a shock. easy can't make a cogent point, so he starts ranting scripture and threatening damnation. let me type up his response: '<flush> let's see how smart you are when you're suffering in the pit, you obama-ade drinker.'	though there be 450 prophets of baal opposing me, the lord is with me (learn that lesson from the scriptures, sport), and you will never win that fight, or any other.
0	dont begin to understand real love till 18 or older i felt real love when i was 13, and i was with that woman i loved for years. saying someone can't effectively do something until they reach a certain age is ridiculous; turning a certain age doesn't magically make you any wiser nor dumber.	no tennagers that young have to many hormones and dont begin to understand real love till 18 or older and it is wrong and also illeagle to date a minor.
0	You were crowing a bit. What I don't understand is why. How could you possibly be pleased by some strangers religious views. Would you have been pleased if he switched to liking broccoli? (Or disliking as the case may be)	I'm simply pleased everytime I hear that another atheist has changed his/her mind about the existence of a supreme being.
1	You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.  As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?  Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men.	my question is thus, should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child's unruleiness?
0	So given that there are cases where both dies... we just have to give up the mother's right to live over a fetus (which will die)? What if the mother isn't physically ready to have a baby. In the case of a young female (I'm talking age of 9 and younger, cause there are cases of young kids having their periods) being raped, doesn't she a "baby" (and I say baby, because she is still at an age where a parent would consider her their youngin)... have the right to live? For me, if I knew my child was raped and is in no way ready for a child of her own, physically or mentally... I would rather her not risk her life to try and bring that fetus into the world.Abortion should be pro-choice.	If the life of the mother is threatened then there is no winner: one will die and one will live or they will both die.
1	Sure keep thinking that way and never mind the millions he put in his pocket. How was someone else put it? A thimble size brain case almost empty.	Just a little fact to twist around in your little contorted mind.
1	And if there's one thing I can count on, it's your insistence that we can assume guilt and should make a public spectacle of the matter before even investigating any matter.	If there's one thing I can count on, it's your insistence on 100%, beyond any possibility of apologetic excuse creation, demand for absolute proof (with video-tape) if anything involves criticism of Christianity or evangelicals or some association thereof...
1	d'ya think i should? make a mel gibson film and suddenly everyone's an expert eh? well despite what his gibson-ness would have us believe, gallipoli was a case of bad luck, incompetence and generals f*cking everyone over regardless of nationality. remember we lost huge numbers of british troops too. now i don't downplay the role of the anzacs, or their losses. but this was at a time when the british considered australians to be one and the same as themselves. there was hardly the conscious effort to use the anzacs as fodder over the tommies. gallipoli was a blunder (though again not as big a blunder as populist history has us believe) for everyone, regardless of nationality. there was certainly no sinister us and them between our nations- we were essentially considered as one.	by the way you f***ed us too.

1	that wasn't a reason why we fought hitler. in fact, if you will remember many in the states didn't believe that occured until they saw the pictures.  hardly a reason to invade. unless you'd like to flip it around and say that every country who's leader we tried to murder has the same right. emoticonxrolleyes  how is that our problem? oh yes, it's not.  as i recall, we kicked him out, beat him up, put him under sanctions and virtually removed any ability to do anything of revelance.  doesn't that mean we have to invade north korea? emoticonxrolleyes  that's been dealt with already. rehashed arguments are worthless.  huh. stalinist govermemnt. reminds me of the dictators the us put in power in latin america. :) the mass graves also was dealt with. but then again, you clearly do not understand the me culture.	and these are just the things we know for certain.

I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time.	Your definition is that those creatures with survival advantages and characteristics will survive.

0	how did you private insurer determine the coverage in your plan? do they ever make case-by-case determinations not to cover something? i strongly urge you not only to read the house bill and the upcoming senate bill, but also to read your own health insurance plan, in detail, fine print and all, as well as to look into their record of denying claims. it's one of those things that most people don't realize is a problem until it affects them directly, at which point it's too late.	we're still waiting on you to show how the government will determine coverage with your plan.
1	Translation: Muslims are worth nothing. Christianity is superior, therefore they are worth nothing. Let the US come in and kill them, ruin their cities, and take their oil.	Translation: Simone wants Saddam, the Butcher of Baghdad, back in power to murder, gas, rape, and pillage some more.
1	Because the NY Times, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, and Handgun Control are all atheist-lead and anti-Christianity. Yeah.	The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless.
0	Well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution, not as 100% protected but in that gov't cannot mandate a religion. Also, religion is not unilateraly protected, as I've stated several times. There are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise? That being said I have long been a supporter of limited gov't and believe that gov't has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage. They should be silent on the subject.	Why is the CHOICE of religion more worthy of Constitutional protection that any other choice.emoticonXConfused
1	oh yeah..., my fiends did that for me. they had an intervention and they vented. they were pissed me for mercilessly trolling them and it worked. i am now a kinder, gentler, troll ;)	part of me feels the syrians need to fight it out like every other country did, but the other half feels the war needs to be stopped.
1	howard -  who do you say jesus christ is? the long awaited jewish messiah? your resurrected savior for the remission of your sins? the great god and savior (2 peter 1:1)? simple yes's or no's will suffice. p.s. you can probably buy that book i recommended on your argument at amazon.com.	i am tired of you running from question and challenges to your thinking.
0	I believe you, OTHERS pick and choose what you believe. What is sad is how many lose their faith when they find how much they have been mislead.	I believe fully in the ENTIRE Bible (unlike some people) and I DO NOT "pick and choose" what I believe.
1	so you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? that someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? what if it where your nipples? after all nipples on men serve no purpose.	geez, your not normal if you don't have it circumcised.
1	You have conviced no one or even come remotely to forming an argument.	Anyone who wants to legalize bringing a weapon onto a plane is an idiot.Simply stated...Always Stay Open Minded
1	Yes, but an adult asking such a question is not capable of understanding the answer. ;)	Is there any undisputable evidence of one species evolving into another?
1	Wow ehat a brave new world you live in.... Now lets say just 1% of all gun owners resisted (in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land). With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this?	So all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in, I would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon.
1	April was "recent" ? Please provide evidence from the memo of these "examples".	Examples of potential domestic terrorists included: veterans, those against abortion, those against illegal immigration, those who wished for better border control, tax and stimulus protesters, critics of health care reform, gun owners, etc.
0	really? congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; sounds like a requirement to be neutral to me. it could be rephrased: 'don't meddle with religion! do not regulate. neither promote nor inhibit.' why would anyone have a problem with this? and we both know that the limitation of government regulate of rights and liberties is read today, thanks to the 14th amendment, as applying to all legislative authorities in the us, not just congress. no state legislature can establish a state religion either.	it clearly says nothing more than one branch, and one act of governing (making laws).
0	I'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me. I smell posers.	You wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you?
0	I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.	Can anyone make a rational argument as to why executing a criminal who was 18 years old when committing the crime is not "cruel and unusual punishment," but executing a criminal who was less than 18 at the time of the crime would be cruel and unusual?Put another way, can anyone explain why it is constitutional to execute a person who was 18 years old when they committed the crime, but it is unconstitutional to execute a person who was under 18 when they committed the crime?Participants in this discussion should assume that the death penalty, in general, is constitutional.
0	No. It steps firmly in the realm of REALITY Jyoshu.Have you never heard people talk about how police in an area respond in X amount of time for one situation, but for a different situation, like in a neighborhood predominantly black or gay or ___, the response time is four times as long?Have you never heard of how there have been cases where people have died because they tried to get medical help at the "white" hospital?Or how about you read about THIS case and tell me that these concerns aren't real...	This idea that someone's political and/or ideological view on a public referendum issue should have any bearing on whether he should be allowed to do other things is scary, if you ask me.
0	First off, define "government funded". The FBI? The CIA? Other federal law enforcement agencies? The military? All vital government entities that are and should be armed. The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government.	Governments all around the world have killed millions of their own people in genocides after disarming them, proving that government should never be armed.
0	Now you're being ridiculous. The big bang is not the evolution of the universe. The words "evolution of the universe" do not necessarily entail the big bang. For example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.But claiming that the "evolution of the universe" is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?By the way, I have always heard the creationist invention "GTE" referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity.	If someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the "evolution of the universe" because it will just waste time.
1	if the federal government wants to pay for it, fine. the federal government has no business telling private insurance companies how to run their business. especially if they have religious ties. i'm surprised anyone wanted to put their dick inside your rotted out pussy.	if we had federal healthcare, everyone would be paying and everyone would be covered.
0	I don't believe that Orthodox doctrine deals directly with WWII. I am unfamiliar with such. Are you saying that the event you stated had a direct bearing on the cause of the war?Our doctrine would deal with evil, in general. But there may be Orthodox writers who have commented on the war. We are a Church with doctrine, but it would take more than a number of writers commenting on something to make it a 'doctrine'.Armenia was the first nation on earth to adopt Christianity.	Oh btw JW's believe that all that bloodshed and peresecution from 1914-to 1919 was due to satan being cast down to earth by Jesus.
1	Oh? What keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest?   I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. You wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? How many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?	of course you can have a loaded magazine or two on the other hip.
0	Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic.	i didn't mention evolution in this topic.
1	Aw declare victory and slither off eh. I made an assertof fact that was backed up. You made a strawman of abandonment. No one made that claim but you. They come here because they don't get the proceedure in a timely manner. Get it now? Hence you lose as usual.	You made an assertion of fact, and it is therefore your job to establish its veracity with reputable evidence.The argument from (or "appeal to") ignorance is a logical fallacy which claims that a premise is true ("Canadians are coming over the border for our health system in hoards, while abandoning theirs") only because it has not been proven false.Ergo, you lose.
0	Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning. So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service? Is this some kind of hybrid model? Interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation.	All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature.
0	Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage. I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.I think this is an important question, because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect.Until I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt.	I also have to ask why you think he puts so much intelligence into his posts, when all he does is either cut and paste from some anti-evolution site, or say things like "science is a joke" My pet dog could do better.
1	You already screwed them over when you decided to cover their country in radioactive dust. Depleted uranium is a real bitch.	So we should just completly screw them over, and let everything we have faught for go down in vain?
1	And you know he is NATO's boy how? You get a bit more looney with each post there comic relief. Keep the laffs coming tho.	Your boy shot a four-year old.
0	actually they probably drifted much faster than that.....probably upon a pole reversal.	Yes and the continents moved about 2000-3000 miles in less than 4000 years only about a mile per year.
0	Actually, I don't remember that they did. What they did take bets on was that AIG would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe. As I recall, most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so. So now, besides their other so called 'peer reviewed' magazine, they want to pretend that they are doing science here.	But I'm sure that when http://answersingenesis.com came on line, atheists and anti christian bigots all over the internet took bets they would fail just as ripskar is doing now with the creation of this new site.
1	So then how do you know that abortion isn't in the plan then? If as you say we have "VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE"	But why would one expect you to get that?
0	Why do you think they feel no emotion? All the women I know who have aborted did so under very difficult circumstances and it was horrible for them.Most women who seek abortion are not unfeeling sluts. They are real women, with real issues, and real circumstances that lead them to that choice. Want to help those babies? Address the issues the women face and don't demonize. No amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother. Dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone.	I wonder if there were a glass window allowing people to see what they are killing, if they would still feel no emotion.
1	What! You mean that WE don't want to do all of those things? Who knew? I didn't get the memo? emoticonXConfused   And you forgot "make Seniors eat dog food". emoticonXGood	I know, silly me, I should've realized that the Left would naturally think a Conservative wants to take over the world LOL Along with wanting children to starve, dirty air, etc....I'll have to remember who I'm talking to next time LOL
1	Right, what I think doesn't make you naive or delusional, what you think does.	Well it's your right to think what you want, It doesn't make me naive or delusional because I see things different.
1	I thought you had vowed never to post in this forum again. ????? I suppose with your views on divorce, your wedding vows have as much weight as your vow not to post here.	Divorce has been around for centuries and was used in biblical times when a woman or man cheated on their spouse.
1	hmmm. 'wow... and this op made it through the rigorous admin review process? anyway, here is a question for you to ponder about. if god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around?' sounds like a joke to me.  evc forum: human evolution (re: if evolved from apes, why still apes?) but we all know that arch is incapable of opening the blue colored links.	i posted the link proving you are wrong and what do you do?
0	If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too. However, you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work.	To add to the obvious costs of pregnancy, there is also the loss of pay as I would not be able to work (I'm a geologist - this involves quite a bit of strenuous outdoors work), which would even further affect us.
0	So what if the author isn't arguing against gun control? At last, there is indication that England has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody isn't the answer to crime.	The author is arguing that gun control in rural areas does not constitute crime control in urban areas but somehow you try to spin that into making it sound as if the author is making some blanket statement against all gun control.

1	since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes	investigating 'all visiting individuals' is not - well, it is a bit, but less so - and you would not have got this response if you had suggested as such.

1	I'm not interested in who isn't hitting on you. Do you want an ugly, flaming, gay cellulite blubber-wench hitting on you for three years or not??? Or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you??  For the record, gays make normal men's skin crawl, and not in a good way. So keep the spiritually-challenged heathens out of the men's barracks, and out of their showers. Just because you and the rest of the pro-gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok doesn't mean the rest of society does.	i have only ever had one lesbian contnue after that, the number of men that wouldn't let it rest are beyond count.
0	So, you're saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you'd leave right?	To me, you are all or nothing so those that think the Pope is an idiot should probably consider a new faith because they don't believe in the one they say they do.

0	Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA.	The genetic difference between human and his nearest relative, the chimpanzee, is at least 1.6% Calculated out that is a gap of at least 48 million nucleotide differences that must be bridged by random changes.
1	Just another bogus reason for having and abortion............There are thousands of them.........	It seems in this case they used termination to get rid of dna evidence therefore allowing the stepfather to carry on abusing his step daughter.The mother should be charged with destroying police evidence and accessory to the crime.
0	You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to.The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable. The promised veto threat didn't matter in this instance. He was "standing on principle." Well, same would apply for his newfound views disfavoring DOMA as well in my view.	I trust you haven't forgoten who currently holds that position, or how likely his signature would be?

0	Actually, it hasn't. Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam's Razor. Further, DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences.

1	oh, i agree with you...oh wait, did a clarify argument show up in the argument listing? damn! i think it did!	no wonder you're so f*cked up!
1	Yes but its like sharks when there is blood in the water. Plus I at least do this for fun and why should I not get in my own ideas and have my fun with creationists. They are getting pretty rare you know. Can't let those other rationalists keep them all to themselves. emoticonXAgree	Can't just one do the job?
1	oh cc, apparently, 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow. We can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone, we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad ( although, I have her beat by 4 years and counting, still happy and going) We have the power. We are gay, ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say (ask jaaman for more info)	But just in case I'm wrong, perhaps the authorities should be notified of all the heterosexual unmarried couples and they should be hauled off to jail.
0	Very well said, but remember, Evolution doesnt mean atheism, but creationism means religion. I know Christians that believe in evolution, but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism.	:) I can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the Bible suggests, but I don't believe in doing it in a forceable way.

0	Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference.	In class I have to debate why if we were to start a new country why it should be socialistic.

0	I don't think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do. The father is supplying his DNA when he engages in sexual relations. After than point he has in effect signed a blank check. It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime. Fathers to be shouldn't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check. I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years.	And this results sometimes is someone becoming " with child " even though it was not what they set out to do!So should we force them to have the child and put it up for adoption?
0	No it doesn't!It cost way more money in appeals than it does to excute someone. WE the taxpayers pay for legal represenatation for them and us, plus the cost of keeping them in jail. The appelas process alone costs the tax payers millions.It is far more expensive to kill them than to leave them in jail with no chance of parole.	I don't know what exactly to think of it only I think it saves us the cost of prisons!
1	and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES.	And even when they do enter into a more committed relationship, it is usually of relatively short duration.

0	this has nothing to do with my post. you don't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy. i'm an advocate of science, and even i admit that, especially at the quantum level, shit gets crazy. particles being in two places at once, 95% of the universe being undetectable, whole separate universes colliding to make new ones. it's crazy yes, but it is also scientific. in fact, compared to science, the answers psychics provide are rather boring. i'm impressed by the stuff i just listed, not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog.	dude you need to realize this: if the claims i make are true, which i believe they are, then that means all the most crazy, outlandish, extreme conspiracies, are true.

1	did someone hack your account, oblivious? you sound like a fsb bot in this post...	and you have to account for the likelihood of any actual exchange.
0	what about evolution has been observed?  i think it has been more theorized (if thats a word) then anything else. creating theories for theories and so on.	you're wrong about evolution--it's been observed.
0	No, there really aren't. As for Robertson, why do you think I said he was right (as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible) by sheer luck?	He's basing it on the fact he was hot the other day.
0	...well...in the last decade or so we've been starving them to death. where have you been? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being. i'll grant you that. in the case of your c-section question, i think the mother should have the section, but we can never compell her to do so. it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate.	possibly in the example you gave, but what of a very late pregnancy, one that is not an early fetus and could easily exist if a csarian for example were performed?
1	ooooo am i supposed to be concerned at anything you have to say? you're a blowhard delusional wannabe christian who doesn't understand your own claimed religion, how can your word hold any meaning.	i'd tell you to wise up but i don't think you even know how.
0	the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not, and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature. i'm not arguing that i believe in a rapture, but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event. i hope you see the difference	the bible as a whole is unverifiable, and for all we know was written back in the day by a guy who overdosed on opium.
0	It's truly amazing that even someone like KH can disprove evolution so quickly.	His only education past high school is a degree from an unaccredited bible school.

0	You offer no positive evidence towards Creationism nor did you deny that the idea of Creationism as scientific was destroyed long ago.	How am I not defending the "scraps of Creationism"?
0	ToE is a mechanistic theory -- it says life is like a machine. Machines aren't intelligent, they just do what they're made/programmed to do. Darwinists say lifeforms do what they do because of the way their particular genes program them. This is basic stuff.....yet you come along and say this isn't so. So which is it? Is life intelligent or not? If it is intelligent, what is illogical about believing life was designed intelligently by an intelligent designer? The intelligence had to come from somewhere. Where did the information in the DNA code come from?	Indeed, it was neither intelligent nor dynamic.
0	And an even funnier thing is it won't affect his wallet at all.	You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet.
0	separate but equal is never equal? which are better? boys' or girls' bathrooms? other than that last statement i agree 100%. i don't believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we wanted them to be. unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefining marriage and for civil unions never want to give gays all the rights of marriage in a civil union.	basically they are saying that gays are somehow inferior and have to be put in their own instisution lest they sully the institution of marriage (something heteros are doing without anyone else's help).
1	I suppose Piltdown Man was the product of newspapers, cute indeed!	You have to keep pretending that this kind of thing is meaningful.
0	Well sigma, which is more painful??   Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....   OR   A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. It has just as much feeling as the mother.	it said: although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant, powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make .
1	When I think of the great minds of literature, Ann Coulter is certainly not on the top of my list. In fact, when I think of minds, I don't even think she has one. I hope that you write this in jest, otherwise...I would seriously suggest that you expand you horizons. emoticonXFrazzled	If Democrats had any Brains They'd be Republicans by Ann Coulter.
1	What about them? Is this a question?   Um. Have you read Leveticus? And I mean, read it. Not skimmed it.   Because, God loves everybody. Are you reaching?   And what does fast and loose mean? I'm confused. I think you are trying to label me.. but I'm not quite sure what I'm being labled as.   What part about people burning in hell for eternity?	it always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of genesis or the arc, but god really does hate the homosexuals.
0	Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.   IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes.	Your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed.If the chance of mutation A happening is one in a billion, and the chance of mutation B happening is also one in a billion, then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is, as you say, beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.However, we're not talking about a single gene.
1	no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. sorry dear, ad hominems do nothing. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. i apologize i sound that way. i certainly know what i am referring to in the bible, and knowing that you have admitted you don't necessarily follow the whole bible (god > bible) i figured i wouldn't assume you believed in genesis adam and eve. but rather give you the option to say yes or no.  god didn't want us to be puppets.  i didn't necessarily say puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted -and if they did love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets. so god was performing some twisted reverse psychology on adam and eve?	he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted - and if they didn't want to love him, it should be their choice.
1	Why am I not surprised chester, that chloe directly giving an in depth answer to you is perceived as not being germane to the topic. Since you never directly answer any proposition forwarded as you derail every thread by just serving up your off topic tripe. emoticonXGood	Because it is not germane to the topic under discussion and is nothing more than an attempt to hijack the forum into a discussion that is already present in another thread.If after chloe answers my question, which was first, she wants to have that discussion in the appropriate forum, I will be more than happy to oblige her.
0	I'm sure the racist white segregationists after Plessey thought exactly as you do now, "That settles the matter."Little Louise Brown had a big SURPRISE!!! for them.You still have not walked upon the thin ice of the "well regulated" wording, we note.	Some day a court case is going to come around and it's ultimately going to be decided that the Second Amendment isn't an individual right but rather a collective one?
0	That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress.	I can't claim originality for this proof, but I have never heard any good refutation of it.
0	Though I know you directed this question at Cthulhu, I will nonetheless jump in to say that I would quickly choose the newborn mentally retarded baby to live and the zygote to die. That is obvious to me since the mentally retarded baby is a currently existing person vs. the zygote being merely a potential person. That zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present. I would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person (now merely a cell) to die.	Let me pose a hypothetical question.Same scenario as yours above but instead there is a genetically normal zygote on one table or on the other table, there is a mentally retarded newborn baby...which one will you choose if you had 2 seconds to choose?
0	I disagree. I've been in a loving, committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively...how does this have a negative affect on you?	However, this issue of gay marriage transends all of society and it will have a negative effect on all of us.
0	Holy grail implies it is like a religion, which it is not. If evidence is found that overturns this theory, it will be discarded in favour of a better one.	Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began.
0	You are the only one defending them now...the funny part it, planned parenthood had the stats as reasons why abortion should be legal (or is legal). But wait! As we established the number of people that died from abortions went down to under a thousand so this reason is still not accurate and is still misleading. Anymore ideas?	You come on here strutting your stuff that Planned Parenthood is lying or misleading and now everyone can see that you are the one who is misleading.
0	I think that scientists don't work with religion and religion has no place in science class.	The YEC folks want to remove any reference to science from the debate.
1	Did the bill include burning heretics at the stake, stoning them out of the village or removing a women's right to vote?	RTL backed three bills that were recently passed in the Georgia Senate:One requires an ultrasound prior to abortion.Another protects pharmacists if they refuse to fill prescriptions for drugs that end pregnancies.The third allows prosecutors to charge people with causing the death of a fetus, REGARDLESS OF THE STAGE OF PREGNANCY.
0	So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. It was all about how they could keep women down. Tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?	It was mostly done by a few sexist and political oppertunist members of the AMA to stop women from practicing medicine and by xenophobic/racist Protestant groups who feared a non-white/non-Protestant majority here in America after the Civil War cleared out many of them.
1	Evidence? We're talking religion here. Religion. If there were evidence, then it would be science.	Is that a likely possiblity though?What is the evidence for it?
1	Is North Korea a bastion of peace and good-living? Nope. Is it religious? Nope. Therefore obstacles to 'peace' don't necessarily have to be tied in with religiosity.  Hope that's spelt out enough for you. Try to keep up.	i'm used to reading non sequiturs from you, but how on earth you imagine this follows in any way from the post you quote eludes me completely.

1	i don't want or not want to call this 'frame of refference' *thing* anything i'm just trying to work out what you consider it is. tell me what it is. tell me what it's capabilities are. if it is abstract in nature what is it's actual worth as a concept. whatever that is... this *something*? you aren't your body as i've shown but because your body generates your mind it, that which affects the body can effect the mind which i can only imagine is part of this 'frame of refference' *thing*. or, in reality, 'i', 'you' and 'me' is an illusion and doesn't actually exist.	what is important is, if i teleported you, would you still experience the world through that new body.
1	No, but I read some of the evidence and it looked pretty solid. If this person was sentenced to life in prison without parole would you question the verdict?	Guilty of the rapes I'm not disputing (don't know anything about those cases), but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed?
0	That's a completely different issue jo. If those pro gay sites were accurately translating and interpreting the bible as it intended itself to be translated, I would accept it with open arms. But how can I accept the lies that homosexual apologists attempt to tell by distorting Gods truth in order to justify their sin? You should understand that I can't allow that rather than you using those corrupted sources in order to support what you personally want the bible to say. I welcome anyone to take the content of the links that tell each story within my link above, and disregard the info if any opposing info is found regarding the claims they make. But just attacking it because it's a jewish source is ridiculous.	You do exactly the same thing, you frequently talk about "gay apologist websites" with reference to translations of the Bible that son't condone your homophobia.
0	That's the thing, though; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts. supersport, on the other hand, doesn't know any better.	That's really all I have to offer to this debate, hopefully somebody will help verify/strengthen my points, seeing as I'm hardly the expert.
0	What I've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper & deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. They stay quietly in the background-computer base -until, as you said: Hopefully, the person "finds some way of forgiving themselves", right. But what about in the mean-time? - And we know, from research & quite a number of Healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.Much better to life benevolently, in the first place.Annie	That in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves.I believe these testimonies to be real, and I feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations' reputations to kill their own child.
1	Already busted, Mr. Trebor. Went in one eye and out the other. Come back when you have something other than generalized rhetoric.	You seem to be ignoring a whole bunch of passages that reduce that.And, it's amazing how you have to go everyplace BUT Genesis to resolve your difficulty.
0	Hi Smallax, welcome to the forum. I did a search and have found some products which might give you an idea about costs and concepts for performing such an experiment.

I'd be interested in the results.	It brings in the full spectrum light in high lumens, but, because it's glass - it blocks harmful rays.
0	Right. Please, reread your argument. Not to mention what Woodward actually said about Piltdown man. www.talkorigins.org	And what does this have to do with writing an article?
0	Actually, qualified biologists know no such thing. In fact, I've never known one who would agree with that assertion. Can you give us some peer reviewed references to support your assertion?	Biologists now know that individual animals in a population are able to develop specific traits while still in the egg or womb.
1	no reply bassman? seriously mate, i can understand why some people on this forum have a problem with you, you can't just go around posting total lies! you are a sensible guy, for the most part, lets have some reasonable arguments as oppose to mindless bigotry.	because not everyone sees it like that.
1	Well, at least you are more consistent about equality than a lot of people in your movement.	All of the above I do support people should be allowed to live in any relationship form between consenting adults.
0	A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.	If you can't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law, that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else.How can Japan be so much better off than we are, if it's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep; especially when it's unloaded!
0	See above. Whether a couple is or isn't monogomous is not for you to determine or worry about. And speak for yourself if you don't mind. This member of the American public's mental health is just fine thank you very much. If gay marriage impacts YOU that much, well that sounds like your problem.	So if same-sex relationships are legally recognized as "marriage," the idea of marriage as a sexually exclusive and faithful relationship will be dealt a serious XXXX.
0	i'm not playing word games. you said congress doesn't have the power to declare war; how else am i supposed to read that? you meant congress doesn't run the war...you clarified, end of story.	but i will clarify.. congress has the power to declare war...  but congress cannot make war..  you are implying that congress can go into session and just vote for a declaration of war without the president being involved.
0	hello my dear!  what do you think people should live in a peaceful world?  as you know george washington is cruel man who did a lot of bad things in order to be success, to get high position? you know that a lot of people died from washington? most people from iran and irak suffered more distress and you can not imanige that situation. what about the twin towers? maybe you think that that accident was by muslin people? no, it was not! of course washington did it in order to substitute muslim men	if you live in the us,you would now that mr.washington led our country into independence.
0	Pregnancy is a health issue only for the woman. Your glib remark pretending to sympathy is insulting.	that sure was a load of knowledge you revealed there.
1	So your biased reading of the Bible coupled with your personal flaws and your misunderstanding of science is the basis of your religiosity?

0	False and that doesn't invalide evolution given how it's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory.       Gould can take his comments and shove them up his ***.	1) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.
1	Interesting.... have you ever been to a schoolyard recently? I think the "taunts" are more directed at gays. Like "f@ggot" and "fairy". What taunts do you get on a daily basis? What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo.	I think the real problem is that you just enjoy being belligerent and doing things like calling people "weasel" and "dishonest" when you yourself misrepresent like you did above.
0	probably because the article is irrelevant. either way, i posted an article to make you happy so quit compaining and just answer the question with some respect. thanks for just simply answering dog....i'm not sure why it is so complicated. if you don't ask race than how can you be prejudice? there is also no proof that people would currently be discriminated against. but current affirmative action is a topic for another thread.	you say you are using the article as justification for the question and then you want to call us dishonest when you don't even cite the article or the newspaper it comes from?
1	Just like Obama is? Really? Have you researched it at all?	Bush, and W. Bush ALL used "czars" just like Obama is, so don't you DARE come here trying to pull that male-bovine defecation on us, Markie.
1	Well I suppose I could've always put up a sign that said "Trespassers will be held with legal counsel, robbers will be shot, survivors will be shot again" but you're just welcoming trouble with that.	But are there other things that could have been done to prevent the invasion before it happened?
1	And of course, the theory of gravity isn't "physically" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the "Out of Africa" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense.	5) Moving on, if we look teh other way, evolution is actually a theory not physically proven, one of it s theory suggested that human started out in Africa while another in Asia, but if u look at them none resembles the other and none have a characteristic of an animal.
0	It wouldn't. Altering any of the fundamental universal constants changes them all. We wouldn't be considering some small change here and small change there. The universe probably wouldn't exist in any form.	What should the world look like with the very different set of phy[s]ics, chemistry and biology principles?
1	It's a lot easier to kill someone with a gun than a cigarette or a beer.	I guess they were hoping to change the subject to something they could debate, but it didn't seem to work, now did it?Statistically, tobacco kills nine times as many people as all homicides and gun accidents combined, and alcohol kills almost twice as many as die in gun-related deaths.
0	I'm not claiming any omnipotent deciever. I'm not sure where you derive 'probability' from, or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses.And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.	If these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time, then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment?

In one city, Alburquerque, a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where I slept, and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun.Where I worked, less than a block away, a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place.I was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an ER, I didn't know the stupid beast, I was scared to death, but I felt it my Christian duty (even though I am not a Christian) to get the guy to where he could get treatment.And I don't own a damned gun because I am not chicken-hearted.

0	You answered the first one already... it is a 'cartoon'. It showed that just as one was out-lawed, the other was born.

The goal: Defend against attacks by ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and other airborne threats."http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/fi...=0&ti=0&sc=400	What is your point?1) Did the NRA and KKK ever burn a cross together?2) Does Lockheed Martin in Colorado build nukes, missiles, and bombs?3) Did Chuck Heston ever say "From my cold dead hands in Denver"?4) How many edits does it take to make a point?
1	Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want "guilty by association" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice.	The problem is that you are a XXXXX who can't understand what people write.
1	Yes none of the organs flown in from Africa or India would be farmed from murdered people, would they?	If I ever ran on a platform like this i'm positive i'd never get elected, but I still think they're some mighty good ideas:1) Organ markets.
0	Actually, it isn't. It is complex and complicated. It requires diligent study of difficult concepts. But when you grasp the basics, it does become evident. But most creationists aren't willing to put in the effort.	It is so easy, so simple, so evident is not it?

1	So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.	Gay husband is not a legally recognized category.Agreed, when the wife is part of a hetero relationship.
1	whatever happened to the unborn baby? No consulting him or her I guess. Even though the unborns body is being is the one being torn apart.	So sorry to butt in, but I would think that yes, what the woman wants is all that matters since it's her body and her ...well, this has been gone over a hundred times.
1	how about small cute animals? whare is the line of what religion allows, and law forbids? we know it is not where harm comes to another person, or poligamy would be legal	Um, that would be murder, which is against the law and does harm the person being murdered.A union between 2 mutually loving people doesn't even begin to compare to that.

0	that's not because of something i did. that's because of something that happened back in the 1950s, i believe. that's fine--go ahead and be offensive! it will only hamper your efforts because it only makes people angry at you when you belittle things they hold dear. but what about religious people that aren't out to do that to you and your family? if the govt. endorses a religion, remove the endorsement! that's fine. you're still willing to be offensive to all religious people because of fundamentalists (which are really the ones doing what you describe!). you can be as offensive and show as much lack of respect as you want. it's only going to make it harder on you to convince people.	if you really respected my belief, or lack thereof, my kids wouldn't be asking me what god is because they hear it in the pledge and read it on our money.
0	So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.	It turns out, the Johns Hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life.
0	Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity? It sounds to me that this "new" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find. ...*Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected inthe adapted strains.*...	We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century.
1	so your saying dr. tiggerroo, that my parents decided i would be gay for me. fascinating. do you have any other amazing rubbish to spit out of your mouth. i am captivated by your amazing intelligence on this subject. it sound like you have been studying this all through kindergarden. grow up, get a clue.	honey, the fabulouslness of my being can be nothing but natural!
1	I don't care for the respect of utter nincompoops. I'm happy to tolerate them, but don't expect me not to laugh at them.	You can hardly expect respect if you are not prepared to give any
0	That's not evidence, that's an assertion. As for my dogs (cats), yes. They do put on a winter coat in the much warmer winter climate than Arizona in which I live. So I return to my original question, on what evidence do you base your claim that an arctic fox would not change color in the winter in Arizona?	Tell me, if you took your dog to the arizona desert, do you think it would it would put on a winter's coat?
0	Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically. (and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal)	If a proposed law just happens to agree with your religion, or if religion is just one small part of the motivation, then it's not a problem.
0	So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much. So we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can.	"There'll be cheering for our results on the pro-life side and denouncing us angrily on the pro-choice side, Neither of those positions is sound."
0	It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific.	For you, you seem to be suggesting that truths in the physical world can only be gathered by scientific means.
0	Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem. Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected, and America is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes. However   Ms. Feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control  did not help the creditability problem either. I guess only time will tell.	Chalk it all up to the election of a Democratic president with a long record of supporting gun restrictions and a Congress that includes a surprising number of pro-gun Democrats from rural areas.
1	'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful"? What a giant load of steamy BS. Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening. There are over 6 Billion people on this earth today. If motherhood was so damn dangerous, don't you think the population would be a lot lower, even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth? Where do you get this BS from, Planned Parenthood?	You can't force somebody to go through this life-threatening condition that is always physically harmful.
1	Well, the antichrist is going to come and make any true believer a heretic any way so what am I worried about? I knew the risks before I accept the job. :-)	They would say that you weren't a real Christian as well.
0	Really? Do all your views depend on somebody else changing them for you?	personaly against... Like to have my mind changed thoughemoticonXGood
1	Sorry but I don't read your posts, do you think I worship your word or something?	I explicitly told you I was a catholic before 'converting' to objectivism, so forgive me for not being impressed with your powers of speculation.
1	Hoo boy! That target just got larger. You still don't get it, do you? Not a "slave contract," but a covenant, a promise :)	You want to revert back to taliban-like legislation?
0	********. Utter fraking ****. Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor. You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians.	For another thing no substantive reasoning that all scientists use is empirically testable which is why subjective/objective duality is the philosophy of natural science.
1	Dear smiling, friendly, forgiving Archangel:  I would be quite happy to respond to you if you could organize your incoherent mental states into logical, debatable points. Please refer to Chester's Questions for Bible-thumpers for guidelines.  As for staying on topic: since there is no God, it is rather pointless to have religious ceremonies in any case, isn't it?  As for my nom de Web, you have missed the point altogether. Either you are not quick on the uptake and/or you are completely ignorant of the Japanese language. Hint: surely you have seen the starry emblem on all Subaru cars?  To end on a conciliatory note: I entirely agree with the last sentence of your posting [except the punctuation].  -	and you notice how he just ignores my response to his attack and continues to post off topic drivel reminiscent of penfold and chester.
0	Pro-choice? Why do you assume I'm pro-choice? I often play devil's advocate...I was using china as an example to show you that people when desperate, trying to get around laws (in this case the 1 child law), will abandon their children to death in the gutter -- it was unrelated to abortion laws -- it was an illustration of as aspect of human nature, which you deny.	I asked you to provide evidence that countries with abortion being illegal will have babies thrown in streets, you just provide me with countries that have abortion legal and babies thrown in streets, maybe you should question your position.
0	Do you actually have any idea how science works? Why are you not embarrassed for creationism?	How can it get anymore embarrassing for science that they got the premise wrong for all these years?
0	just how many cases do you want to read that says exactly what i am quoting? i just gave you a taste of things to come...like the right to be left alone. even the 10 year census, all that is required by the xivth amendment i: 1. number of people who live there 2. sex of each 3. age of each that completes the enumeration and registration for the census. i will ask the 3rd time before i cover you up with cases, show me the enumerated power of any branch of government to require a person to register any right, much less firearms.	not one single thing you posted here indicates that registration would be unconstitutional.
0	Ditto squared. If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified. And I must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason, the public stance against them might not be so strong.	Of course they do.
1	Thanks, for giving me the balls. I didn't know you were trying to convert me. So, because I don't believe what you want me to I'm retarded. You know I could say the same about you, it works both ways. You see I don't want to convert you, all I'd like to see is you open your mind to other possibilities. Adios, Arrevideci	There's no point trying to explain to him why it's WRONG to believe in something completely improbable.
1	Mr Rodgers was a pedophile and Big Bird was a flamer. ;)	Mr Rodgers all lies??
0	if they are used in reference to god, then how can you possibly say they don't refer to god??? jesus himself said he he and his father are one, in john 10:30. and the three appear together numerous times in parallel grammatical construction, denoting equality. it's a harder argument to make that the three are not god and that any one is lesser than the other in terms of divinity, than to say they are god.	no no no.. the concept that these three references were all 'god' came later.
1	Yes but your one of those Christians people hear about, but never find. You don't really exist. :)	I don't have a denomination, I simply try to follow scripture as clearly as it denotes.
1	I suppose if you Truly Believe its not dishonest to repeat anothers ideas as if they were your own. I will keep this in mind the next time I have to write a paper. Woe betide any professor who accuses me of plagiarism, for he is trampling my religious freedoms!	My friend, it was not dishonest, if it was I would work out my salvation with fear and trembling.
1	This rates an 8 out of 10 on the hypocracy scale. Weren't you just scolding people both for using false analogies and for citing emotionally laden imagery for political purposes? Tsk tsk.	er, I mean, take down those nativity scenes.
1	and suddenly vor's list of incorrect statements has finished another lap around the universe! the area which was litterally saturated with cruise missiles was sparsely populated. the brass complained about 'hitting empty tents with multi-million dollar cruise missiles.'  suddenly you are concerned with killing innocent civilians? seriously, you have no problem when bush's policies gets a few thousand killed, but the instant clinton's massive cruise missile launch aganist terrorists kills one innocent, you're all over him. talk about massive hypocracy. you bitch about clinton not doing anything, then you bitch when his attacks on terrorism cause collateral.  seriously, get some therapy and some education.	some people would say that launching long range missiles and killing innocenet civilians was a diversion to take the heat off of monica and he in the oval office......
0	You're a little confused about that. It's all real DNA. Some of it just doesn't code for anything. But some parts of non-coding DNA (which you call "junk") has other functions besides coding for proteins.	Evolutionism on the other hand uses all of our current technology in microbiology to sort out 'real dna' from 'junk dna'.
0	But there is evidence that we do evolve. I'll give you an example. In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry.	we simply do not evolve, there is no scientific proof just ideas which change from day to day that also explain our siciety today.
1	Are you blind, or can't you read? NATO just provided evidence right now.	do they ever, just page after page of posts with no evidence
1	yep. and look at those goalposts flying across the field: so we go from showing where he ever did this to showing where he did it five times. and if five examples are provided? well, show me ten! and if ten are provided, he'll want at least half of his post count (roughly 2500). why? the point has been made, the challenge he himself laid out has been met. still waiting for the proof i'm lying archie. want to head on back to that other thread and show where i lied?	you can always tell when you've scored a hit on archie.
0	That's why the Second Amendment protects the private ownership of arms like the .50 BMG and other such powerful weapons.	In the vanishingly small likelihood of the event ever coming down down to it, your handgun is not going to face them down or give them a moment's pause on any measure.
1	I did not say that I thought that, that would be putting words in my mouth. Sure they'd have access to the report... Sneddon probably had his grubby hands on it ASAP. So what if the investigation was done by private investigators? If Sneddon did it, he would plant evidence... he probably did that when they searched MJ's house. Oops I mean... the government NEVER lies. emoticonXWow	You seem to think that child services only did this investigation this week.
1	That's deep.  Movement is not matter, I will use that the next time I decide to babble.  Are the particles no longer matter when there moving ?  Your funny.	the movement itself is not matter
1	Well, when the people who market prayer come up with evidence that it works as described, let us know! As a meditation technique, it might work fine, who knows, but then, so do many other methods.	We haven't been talking about marketing techniques at all...just whether prayer ever works or not.
1	it looks like you have tried to analize everything i say as being 'my' life experiences. i really enjoy your abuse , i would love to meet up with you some day. my life is fantastic actually. i dont know why i have to keep repeating that. what about those in haiti right now ? what about others? i think they are more important than your fucking sulking over the americans lousy pronunciations.or me whining over you being an arsehole. as for amy winehouse , no reputable establishment would dare touch the skank.	i should use you as an example of humans with shitty lives.
1	Within one post.   Thanks for proving that creationist are incapable of discussing the original topic and automatically move to change the subject.	Want to bet how fast a creationist here is going to try change the subject?
1	Um no... It's the truth... Um, I guess it was sarcasm, but I don't think that would be something that you would understand.	You are speaking in some sort of code.Is it a racist code?
1	Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?	Once ID theory (which isn't theory since it is not based on evidence and testing) is allowed into the schools, then the next step will be to introduce the fundamentalist Christian god as the designer.
1	You can believe what you want, your beliefs are not relevant to the issue.	I believe every animal was probably initally created to be vegetarians, and at some point after the Fall, any animal populations that did not consume a regular diet high in vitamin C experienced a mutation so that it could be produced internally.
0	Yes Peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. Why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us. What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. Can't you see that Peeling? None of this is provable.	Other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree, sure, but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable.
1	It is impossible to read something that can't be found.	“Maybe you should read up a little bit about what the Bible says on abortion.”
0	No nation is perfect, Rev. Not even the USA! A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail.You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK, the USA and Australia. There is injustice everywhere.	while the HOME INVADER got out in less than 1 and continued his trade.......The problem though is that YOU worry about a 12 year old with a water pistol as opposed the the CRIMINAL invading your homes...You live in a Sick Sad World my friend.
0	Ok...many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU, South America, Asia, and so on....this hypocrisy annoys me.	Ive read that story, and many, many people have been killed and suffered with Bush's policy in africa.
0	Incorrect.   Evolution is not something that must be adhered to. It is a scientific theory. As such, if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn't account for, then the theory would be altered or scrapped. It's really quite simple.	You have your conclusion, so everything else must adhere to it.
1	we'd have define consensus first. if it is 50% + 1 then there probably is one. then after that, who is saying they are wrong? prejudice as its finest. lesz likes to stereotype people to an extreme that can never be changed. i have never told lesz my views on global warming and lesz has shown no interest in gathering facts about what others believe.	we've yet to hear why they think the scientific consensus is wrong.
0	How else should it be done? It is a constiturionally protected right. To eliminate that right, the constitutional protection must be removed first, is the removal itself, becomes unconstitutional.	So its basicly an argument against those who wants to ban weapons without changing the constitution?
0	You two are on the same side, you just don't know it yet. And you're both friends of mine so shake hands and make up willya? emoticonXHohoemoticonXGoodAnd yes's video IS very disturbing because it shows that in a time of natural catastrophe's or mass turmoil, our Government will confiscate guns from law abiding citizens. During the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict, the Gov't ordered all gun shops to lock down and to stop selling ammunition. So even law abiding citizens with legally registered weapons couldn't buy ammo to protect themselves.	This is not very helpful to you... first off, you're talking to a right winger... second, you're not debating with someone who has done this to you, though I think your claim is questionable.
1	so you're one of the many people you got question 1 right emoticonXIdea thank you...thank you. You are the many reasons why the US is still standing on its foundations and not collapsing into senseless ignorance...THANK YOU! :)	Also, the Earth takes 365.25 days to go around the sun.
0	I believe the large majority of such deaths occur among inner city kids who don't know anything about guns except for what they see on TV and movies.	Im shuddering thinking about all the accidental deaths related to children.
1	Because of your question " What is your definition of pure", I now know how to make soap. I'll never stink again!!! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis. Ya know stuff that makes sense.	I don't know if one can consider this homeopathic medicine though.I guess I don't know what's being called homeopathic medicine these days.If someone comes up with something that works can they just call it homeopathic medicine and say that homeopathic medicine works?
0	oh yeah. the things i do for fun just ruin my appetite. i like to look at bacteria under a couple of microscopes i have. sometimes i just place random bacteria together to see how they react. usually they dont do anything. if you do have questions don't be afraid to ask.	that's really interesting and that would be awesome if i could ask you questions my college course is based on biology so i could use the help xd i can see why it would put you off certain things :)
1	Your god sees no degree of sins. Shaving your beard, baby-rape, etc, are all punishable by death. That is, unless you repent. emoticonXBanghead	28Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.32For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.Ezekiel 18
0	Obviously that is the case. We cannot simply say that a certain God exists and have it be so.	While ALL gods can not be shown to exist, it can be pretty conclusively shown that certain gods do not exist.
0	If you can't eliminate demand you could try to limit supply and control access to that supply.	The market will never go away.
1	So let's just kill them and be done with it. Is that what you're saying?	The poor can't afford it and the rich don't want it.
0	That is what it said. Now your website gives a false translation to this. It clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed.Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person (in the Christian faith) is formed before conception! This shows that God has already created you. God also talks about how you can't kill a person he created. This is an easy concept to follow.I suggest if you wish to learn what the Bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say. Religioustolerance.org is a joke that misleads people into making God what they want him to be.	And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow, he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
1	Cannot be helped. You make it far too easy. But do not think of yourself as a loser, think of yourself as a student with significant learning deficets.	Ah, well, girls, if you can't shop, malicious snickering will have to do, won't it?
1	No I can't marry them becasue some of them are married. Also none have intent to li ve within Mass.	Mana'ia, you have the right to marry all of those rich people if they consent.
1	An objective test? Wow! Tell me, how do you prove this test is a true useful test? Please don't tell me reason or yet another objective test.	When nature says no or maybe to your hypothesis during empirical testing, that is more than pure reason.
1	So you see a cop on the streets, you see he's armed, that's enough to induce aggression and violence, possibly cause you to hurt others, simply because you saw that somebody else was armed?	"Even the sight of guns, which people think of as objects that can hurt others, can induce aggressive ideas."
0	And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a "high powered rifle" despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics.	Seven million people have applied for criminal background checks since November in an effort to buy guns, according to the FBI.
1	Again, key word "genetic". My hair has the genetic characteristics of a human, but that doesn't make getting a haircut murder does it?	The fetus / baby has all the genetic characteristics of a human being from the start.
1	Here in Michigan, they closed down the first rest area on I-75 because of the high amount of gay encounters taking place there. Maybe you should poke your head out of your closet once in a while and see what the rest of your community is up to.	You're caught, and now just making it up as you go along.
0	No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious.	The 10 commandments are a real time story, told and recorded by the person with whom it happened to... Moses.Genesis, is a history lesson, told by a man who had no understanding of modern science, or the language to describe it in that fashion... Moses.
1	ah but freedom of speech has many limitations. Since liberals are opposed to American principles their speech can be considered treasonous. No country can survive if it allows itself to be undermined. Lincoln went all out to preserve the country, we should do the same things by making liberals illegal.	There is no logic in your argument at all.For starters, what you recommend flies in the face of the first ammendment.
1	yeah a spending problem increasing our deficit by 800 billion  dollars by not taxing the muckety mucks that outsource american jobs to china. oh and where is this borrowed revenue coming from to lets the super rich get a break? china. what are the walton's the owners of wal mart getting by this deal? a 32 billion dollar tax break! i wonder what we could do with 32 billion dollars hmm? you think their going to increase employee wages? healthcare? pump it back into the economy? hell no.... what a scandle. it's the end of this country as we flippin know it people and personally it makes my stomach hurl. go ahead easy. beg the walton's for your lost job back, or your wages, or to pay for your kids books out of charity when the state funds run dry.... go ahead and beg....	the bush tax cut made the rich richer but did nothing for the economy.quote] that's hog drivel.

What do you want a video of him raping her or something?	*pokes nose in*Innocent until proven guilty?I don't have much to say about the actual topic, but if I can point out to Ethmi every time he fails to understand the Burden of Proof idea, then with any luck after a while he might actually stop misusing it...This is one of those times.

0	actually, it can be proven whether leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, magical space monkeys and livining care baers, and even god, exists or not.the question of proving a belief seems kinda self-contradictory to me. if something is a fact that can be proven, then your belief about it is irrelevant. likewise, if you believe something, whether there are facts to support it or not, its still your belief. there are people who believe things inn the absence of supporting facts, and sometimes even in the face of opposing facts. the term for that is faithfaith is the belief of something in the absence of evidence. if you have faith in something, proof is irrelevant, or at least it should be	I cannot prove that my belief in my specific God is true any more then I can prove that leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, magical space monkeys and living care bears exists.
0	I have no idea what this could possibly mean. It makes no sense, semantically or logically. It is so vague as a concept as to be worthless in terms of the pursuit of knowledge.	But ever since the fall, the mind (and information) has been degenerating and losing complexity.
0	yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. i am impressed.	i'm an atheist and i support you 100%.
1	trebor - it's humerous to watch your denial mechanism work overtime, trebor. for the 3rd of 4th time, where in your tanakh does it say your animal sacrifices for sin were abolished? shouldn't you be out trying to find a nice young lamb or ram for slaughter? lol!	that is the self serviing rhetoric that you resort to when you run out of arguemetns, and must concede.

0	1) Charliegone's article was a published research article.I would love to know where "NARTH's" editorial was published, if it even was published.2) NARTH's article DID NOT show any "higher homosexual activity" because of legalized gay marriage.It thoroughly failed to show ANY rise in homosexuality in ANY "gay marriage" country. It showed some studies which were reportedly done in those countries, but that's it.	Yet, you neither offered verified links to support the one you posted, nor did your original link respond directly to SOCs issue by showing that countries which legalize gay marriage don't result in higher homosexual activity.

0	To point our an error, i believe the baby was at the infant stage, not the toddler.	What it really means is "killing in the name of mercy for my comfort".people need to start realizing that the world doesnt revolve around them and that life itself is a gift TO ALL!
1	And I didn't. Did you note how I explicitly put [Jesus said] for the first two quotes from the Bible, but not for the third one? Any idea why? Come on, think ... you can do it!	You can't take the tail end of a story and say that Jesus was saying to have them killed in front of Him.
1	confirming god is, at best, a one-on-one job....anyway. unless someone has personally experienced the things of god - how would one go about proving it? i know, i know...can't prove a negative....	i am sure you have convinced yourself that was what you saw.
0	I don't agree with this debate. If preventing the Devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by God then why is it that God did prevent the Devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated? They are both essentially taking the Devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good. God seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other. Why would that be?	He could go back to God any time he wanted to, but he doesn't want to.
0	Don't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in. I'm not that easily fooled.	That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous.

1	This is begging so many darn quesions it's boggling my mind!	I would venture that the acquisition of property is still a component of the pursuit of happiness but since the supply of wannabe property owners has outpaced the supply of property, I would venture that a libertarian's pursuit of happiness now involves activities pertaining his penis- providing that he can remain straight and sober long enough to make such activities worthwhile
0	i'm surprised no one has mentioned the subject of quantum mechanics in this thread. it seems to be a very good example of the concept, instead of perhaps parallel lines. the fact that things can exhibit mutually incompatible properties of either a particle or a wave depending on how we observe them is incomprehensible, yet certainly reality, no? and i think this is just one example of the apparent incomprehensibility of qm . . .	covering the entire universe, not for specific examples within the universe.

Despite my explanation of his mathematical misleading, wabbit continues with it.Some of you with better short-term memory might remember that I stated that there is little debate that many of Kettlewell's experiments were imperfect. wabbit has posted some excerpts to this effect, but really, all we need to do here is realize that wabbit has quote mined to his little heart's content. Here's a portion he purposely excised:	"Among the criticisms of Kettlewell's original predation experiments (and these were first raised by Kettlewell, himself) is that the numbers of moths he released on trees created artificially high densities, and that the moths were put onto the trunks of trees which may not be where they actually pass the day exposed to predators.

1	Do you have to have human organs to be considered a person? Who made this rule??? You? What if you get lung removed...are you less of a person? So around 8 weeks though you believe it is in fact a human?	This is a fact and the question is not whether the human organs are fully developed or not but the fact that there are no human organs at all in a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks.
1	Yes yes yes. We know you are bigoted against any non-christian. I am sure that the out of context quotes are totally misrepresenting Islam. But, your out of context quotes totally misrepresent Judaism too.. so that is no surprise.	Old Allah must be schizophrenic in real life then not to know Jesus is divine and the only way of salvation (John 14:6, Acts, 4:12, etc.).
0	Would that work like the ban on illegal drugs in American? Does that ban keep illegal drugs out of American? The ban on illegal drugs does one thing, it does keep illegal drugs from law-abiding citizens. Law-abiding citizens are the only ones that respect the law when it comes to bans.	Would be a far more succesful way of enforcing gun-control.
0	So much for lists of registration and "safe storage". Same thing happened when Hitler took over a country and got hold of all the lists. They were especially interested in the gun lists and radio lists.	Police hunt armed bandits targeting gun stashes in homes  Melbourne Australia.
0	You have done a marvelous job knocking down strawmen of your own construction. Having offered a naive and superficial caricature of atheism, agnosticism, and theism, you then imagine a self-serving hierarchy that is, in a word, worthless - all in a silly effort to show yourself most humble. Ironic.	So we have, in order of humility:Agnosticism: Don't know, can't know.
1	Uncle Sam hasn't tried to pass a law saying people can't install left-handed doornobs, to supposedly protect the doornobs of right-handed people. I guess right-handed people don't feel threatened by the minority. What a concept!	To the best of my knowledge Uncle Sam hasn't passed any laws forcing people to install left-handed doorknobs.
1	my hate of iniquity vs. your love for it? get a new dog, brummer.	wow.....is that what that word means....lol.....you're kidding right....you just convieniently give words your own defintions that seem to coincide with your hate....that is so classic!
1	that doesn't suprise me. again i'm not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people aren't equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate women. this reveals way too much about your nature. it ain't pretty. try living homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on '1million a year' emoticonxrolleyes now if the '1million a year' person gave the homeless person 1/2 million a year, then they would be equal, because equality is at the entre of such socialist ideals.	personally i don't see someone that makes 1million a year any different then someone that is homeless.
1	oh hank, you really are funny. the way you are changing. i simply made a statement that it was one of many posts that you have agreed on. that was the post you disputed. are you still near all those paint-fumes? it must be the rotational affect of the egg-shaped world you live on! :) as i said... how simple is that? it is one that you've agreed on, and you now agree that it's one of several that you've agreed on. what is your point?  i made a statement that you now agree on. you raised an objection, you even say that everyone knows what you said, excepting me. how have i demonstrated i don't understand you? i haven't disputed your original statement. i made a complimentary statement.	my point is, your reply was not what i said.
0	The fact that it's the truth is why I keep repeating it.	You keep saying the same things over and over again, that doesn't make them true.
1	Well personally I tend to always question the intelligence of someone who believes that that a cosmic Jewish Zombie who was his own 2000 year old space god father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree...	Oh MY GOD, you're not even smart enough to look around you and recognize the workings of the living God, and you have the nerve to question my intelligence?
0	Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term. A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example. Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils.So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption.	If the flood never happened (an assumption), then it is much more likely that the dating method would be accurate to ages of tens of thousands of years as many evolutionary scientists state.
0	avoiding what question, penfold? emoticonxbanghead how is asking iangb to take it to the 'challenger's corner' an avoidance? i see it as a chance to amplify the discussion. at any rate, it's a lot easier to answer a question if you know what is being asked. so,... feel free to repeat the question that you are accusing me of trying to avoid.	does anyone but chuz see this as anything but avoiding the question?
1	whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh.	besides, even if he somehow manages to prove that ridiculous claim, that doesn't actually prove god.
0	so their support of bush (so you say) means exactly what? that they were listening to the sound bytes dished out by bush's rhetoric? and where is bush is the man and jim's trucking? usually they're all over it when someone says something bad about the american people. oh, that's right... it's ok when a person on the right says it, it's when it said by a liberal like moore that it becomes an issue.	geeeeeeez, most americans don't know their a** from a hole in the ground, they just listen to the sound bytes that are dished out by the liberal press
0	Yes, but how do you legally get it into international waters? Once there, where do you go? There aren't too many ports where ordinance is allowed. Since I am a law abiding citizen, where, other than international waters, may I legally have a gun?

0	There is a pretty huge difference.Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences.	From what I have found, they are identical with the exception of one is religious and the other secular.
1	Ready to condemn blind faith yet, jyoshu? Or are you going to stick to the argument that blind faith is fine so long as you can see you're not doing harm?	What this family should be described as is a 'refusing-medical-care-family.'
1	No, you wouldn't have. I'd have a better chance of winning the lottery without buying a ticket.	That would have been alot differant then having intercourse, see that you are pregnant, and aborting it.
1	I guess it's okay to lie for Jesus just so long as He ain't intently watching.	In other words, he is unwilling to promote his view when he's not allowed to lie or when he will be required to answer questions he doesn't want to answer.
1	You're deluded, as usual. Anything that doesn't balance the budget is based on LIBERAL THINKING. And you don't balance the budget with massive tax hikes and gutting the military like the liberals are fond of doing. And you're going to vote for liberals? Obama? His latest budget plan was defeated 414-0 in the House. Not even his liberal cohorts would vote for it. And you vote for Obama? What the hell is the matter with you people?	They hate liberals, but leave us no choice but to vote for those liberals because nitwits like you ensure that we dont have a conservative choice.Way to go.
1	And yet we're still waiting for your mental condition to finally hit you like a ton of bricks.... Denial is the usual reaction...	Yet in spite of their sanctimonious arrogance I actually feel sorry for them because of the massive fall which awaits them when the reality of their spiritual condition hits home on that final day.
1	Losing again I see. Don't change the subject. How are supporting 'gay sex debauchery' and lying in any way synonymous?  You have made the accusation. Back it up.  If different words are too much for your miniscule brain to cope with, I suggest you try yelling your hogwash on a street corner, where less people will be able to see how much of a fool you are.	you run around and think god doesn't get involved in these things.
1	And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said, "There can be no liberty without virtue." Someone else once said, "Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings".   If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - "The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur.	They want decreased regulations on society (legalize drugs, gay marriage, etc.

1	You don't understand words; why the hell was I thinking you'd understand numbers? emoticonXRolleyes	I realize you're praying that I didn't notice, but look at the sharp downturn at the 2000 mark, which completely nullifies the point you're trying to make.
1	How about you post all the " Great Amount" of evidence concerning the Gospel Mythology. The fact that you don't even bother to read the actual information and form an argument tells me you have nothing......	But what I really relish above all else is how much stock you skeptics put into defending a non-substantiated Q theory for which there is zero historical evidence while at the same time trashing the historical Gospels for which there is a great deal of evidence!
1	Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. The only ones who tend to ask "Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position.	I believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks.
0	what did sanger say specifically that leads you to this conclusion? the preceding is from wikipedia. now, perchance, does 'cleaner' possibly mean having been exposed to enough medical information to be aware of veneral diseases so as to know how to avoid them? do you have an aversion to accurate information about stds being available?	you cannot change the fact that sanger advocates a 'cleaner' race, nor the tactics that she advocated.

0	Reading Difficulties, huh?      There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there.....	Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is "settled law" and the subsequent power to make it so?
0	But we also don't know that evolution is true - it is a belief system about the past that requires faith for it to have any reason. Your first part is already false (proved above).	It is not a rational alternative to the theory of evolution, unless you can somehow show that you aren't relying on the unknowable.
0	Well, since you've called those who've disagreed with you here stupid (and variations thereof), and insinuated that they're too stoned to understand you, I think you have the most ground to make up. You also provide no support for your statements, most of which were debunked years ago as drug czar propoganda.	So when will YOU grow up?
0	what laws? as far as i know you are allowed to do so. w/o the ordinance though.  i'm familiar w/ mr. konsen's paper, but i shy away from so broad a definition. i think defining 'arms' as weapons that may be carried by a man a good, and true definition.	what did the founding fathers intend with the second amendment?
1	why am i not surprised at your lack of a response to my point? why am i not surprised that you're supplying no evidence? and there are millions of bedrooms with people gettin' busy inside, too. can we rail against those as well? in bed, with their partners. you're married and you still don't know where this generally happens?	if you actually think that the vast majority are there just for a drink with friends then you explain why we have millions of abortions each year by mostly single unattached women?
1	I can't convert you JSD, only Christ can. But you must be open to Him and His Spirit for that to happen so don't be looking to me to save you. And you may think I'm self deluted, as in somehow watered down, but you are self deluded as in completely entrenched in your bigotry and ignorance of what is right and true. But thanks for judging me. I welcome it. :p	You are really one of the the most self-deluted zealots I've run across.
1	A nameless face to the feds? In this era of paranoia and fear and overgrown governments? As if any of us are private and unknown individuals anymore.	You sign your life away and are no longer a name less face to the feds but you may be able to own one in your state.
0	I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?	Unrestrained capitalism is a beast that will eat itself.
1	Horse manure. When did you invent that self-serving rule? Put it back in your ditty-bag.	It's not FREE if you are faced with a consequence for your choice.
1	But how can we make rules without legal lines in sand? At least its better than an illegal line.	Yes, it is interesting how we draw an arbitary "legal line in the sand" with regards to determining how late into a pregnancy an elective abortion is available.
0	So you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate Brown and let him stop the bill? You suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide.	The possible scenarios that could get the healthcare bill made into law are both suicidal moves that will cause the Democrats to become Washington outsiders in quick order.
0	Here's a question; which one split from the other? Which one is the "new" being? None of them are. If I get a cake and slice into two exact pieces, which one is the "new" slice? They are both equally new.	And would you stay in the same body or move into the other body while this other being inhabited the original body?

0	that speaks a lot about you and shows other posters they shouldn't take what you say at face value. yes it does. if i go before congress and say 'being gay is a choice without a doubt made at age 11' and had no evidence than i should be laughed at. same thing as this woman. she makes a claim with no evidence and reason to lie. this makes you not credible.  than a legislative body? while probably true, this is sad because newspapers have none.	and as for 'should not be listened to', considering you take the self-contradictory bible as fact, written by people who were furthering their own superstitions, you're hardly a person to be criticizing... emoticonxrolleyes
0	The other articles on her website are also well worth reading: Musings on Christianity, Homosexuality & the Bible	The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion.But in the case of civil same-sex marriage, instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here, we oppose the idea, quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals, nature, tradition, history, and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground.
1	Again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. As if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.

1	So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico.	But Sunday's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes.Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation "can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address, once again, the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again.
0	The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. Personally, I disagree. When we kill children in Iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all.	Then you say the death of the Kurds and the WTC mean nothing to you.
0	It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.	Intelligent design is a recent concept (not associated with any one religion) and it hasn't had over 100 years to be studied.
1	Perhaps then the problem is a shortage of fiber in you diet?	I do take issue with your characterization of me as a cone shaped paper container overflowing with fruits, nuts, flowers, and grain!
0	There is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism. Binocular vision works. Its balanced and can render 3d positioning in the mind accurately. The lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d, as humans do due to skin that is light-sensitive to a certain extent. It isn't an eye for defending against predators, and it doesn't need one. As for insects, the fact that they've survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well. Have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately?	They too have extra eyes called ocelli, not working eyes mind you; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement.
0	Again, modern birds seem to do fine as do gliding mammals such as flying squirrels.	They would open up to sicknesses far more easily when wounded, hardly the sort of thing a species wants.
1	That's ok, cause it's completely legal to light up a cigarette while driving. I guess some feel that must be a lot safer than using a phone.	(BTW, I think the ban on all cigarette lighters in planes is more than a bit overboard too).
1	You call me or a family I may have, a perversion(sorry the word was "perversity"), but that is not hate? I believe I am probably younger than you, but that doesn't mean I was born yesterday.	As I've pointed out before, I don't hate gays, I just don't believe that we should redefine marriage for them.
0	where is here? you don't seem to want to display your location. we all know there's more than one way to become an american citizen. that said, as an american citizen, english is the native tongue. it's the primary language taught in american schools and it's how our government communicates with its citizenry. i'm not really interested in debating this topic with you, it probably should be a thread unto itself. i think dono was merely pointing out that if you want to make a 'snippy' reply, it carries more weight when correctly spelled.	that is because all citizens are born here, eh?
1	So you are saying that genetics has nothing to do with genetics?	But genetics has nothing to do with it.
0	what is this fsm? if it follows what god says, then it would be a suitable compromize, but i've never heard of this fsm.	more people actuallysupport the fsm school of creationsim - would you agree that this could be a suitable compromise?
0	No you can prevent the life of the unborn because they are not living but I don't think you should end the life of the born.	Because if you can murder the unborn to prevent its suffering, you can murder the baby to prevent his suffering.
0	When the criminal has greater civil protections than his victim, and this is viewed as being civilized, a society is doomed.	But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing.
1	Like evolution, right? You have your conclusion, so everything else must adhere to it. Just answer the question. How to you account for the statements above?	Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of "proofs" reveal themselves.
1	Better a godly set of morals being crammed down your throats than the perverted gay sex hedonism of the devil himself.	The only reason the legislators are bringing this up is to force gay people to live by their christianist religion.
0	so since most abortions weren't rape, do you still support abortions for people who are raped? Just wondering.	Most abortions are consentual, no one FORCED them to have consentual sex.
1	i just love how deliciously ironic this statement here is. well done.	people have the right to freedom of belief and freedom of speech as long as they are not hurting anyone.
0	obviously i don't have a perfect memory or even that i read what you are referring to. why don't you give me a flavor of their 'factual errors?' and are you talking about their news sections or their opinion pieces? and who wrote it? sometimes in the opinion pieces these are submitted by authors in the nations that are the subject. perhaps this was written by a swedish politician who had an ax to grind.	i have actually read quite a few wsj articles on the internet.
0	did you read the artical? to show our children that they are no different then any other.	from what i can tell, no one has ever said gay families can't come to it.
1	Eighty-nine times. Still quite a junior partner. I must admit that he doesn't like to be slighted though, as evidenced by Luke 12:10. One can say some nasty things about the Son of Man, and all's fine. But say one off-colored comment about the Holy Ghost and it's lakes-o-fire time. He needs to get thicker skin, IMO. Do ghosts have skin, BTW?	How many times is God referred to in the context of "spirit of God" though?
0	I'm still confused by this comment. Did you actually mean that? If you did, that is not Pro-choice but Pro-abortion. Women did not have a choice in whether their pregnancies were terminated or not which, having it, is the definition of the PC point of view. So no, they were NOT Pro-choice.	well, if you are right then think about it :they considered millions of people inferior so they made the choice for them I imagine.so the Nazis were pro-choiceemoticonXEmbarrassed

Rap is the lowest form of music that I have ever heard. It is just too primative for my tastes. Once again, I am not a racist, nor am I sexist. I do my own washing. I wish you and your child nothing but the best in life. Some folks think that exposing young children to Rap music is a form of child abuse, I agree with those folks.  P.S. Tell that Southern girl to find another room-mate, you sound like a horrible role model.

1	Does it function better on tobacco? Alcohol? Caffine? How about hundereds and hundereds of different pills?	A society functions better not on cocaine :)
1	oh yeah. way easier. which is why gay marriage has come such a long way since it started. ;) marriage would only be removed from any legal document. it will still appear in religious documents. the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exists.	besides, if the idea of gay marriage is seen as an 'attack' on straight marriage, how exactly is the notion of removing 'marriage' altogether going to be construed?

0	Bad comparisons. A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes (not just limiting it to gun homicides).	Even if the number of defensive uses is only 800,000 a year, that's still a rate of more than 53 to 1 when compared to the number of homicides committed with a firearm.Kleck was a supporter of the anti-gun position.
1	Hmmm, well then, God must be unrighteous since we "evil atheists" - and tons of other evil people - have not been eliminated. What happened to righteousness NECESSITATING the elimination of evil by killing humans??? Well???I guess that in addition to being unethical and easily manipulated, your God is also terribly inconsistent.	unkerpaulit: 2. it does not imply that god is not righteous.

0	Actually we do not know who the first human to get AIDS was. Most likely it was an African who got it from a green monkey last I looked into the matter, most likely by eating the creature. You are perhaps referring to case zero, but thats only as far back as the chain can be traced, its not the first case in humans.	Look at who had it first - gays (first one was from a man who did beastiality in Africa)
1	Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact.	Why would everybody participate in such a conspiracy?Reputations among scientists are made based on the accuracy of their data and the implications of their discoveries.
0	I argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster. Do we have any of those on this message board? Because from what I can see, it's primarily the "religious" argument counter...	And what of people who oppose homosexual relations or legalized gay marriage, or both, but who aren't religious and therefore don't even use religion as an argument?
0	jessica, all these problems you've listed, the human body takes care of automatically and remarkably well. the fact still remains that only less than 5% of all abortions occur because the risk is great enough to be deemed life-threatening to either tha mother or the child. and that percentage is diminishing as well. the overwhelming majority of abortions occur simply because the woman decides she does not wnat to be a mother.	It is also always life threatening - women still die from it and you never know how childbirth is going to go.
0	For years I've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact. To date, no takers. Want to step up?	And all having a real, verifiable negative impact on society, which cannot be said about gay marriage.
0	wow. just because people believe in god or claim so does not mean they have or use god as their moral compass. the god, i assume we are talking about the christian god, does not promote war and if we are to actualy follow what this god teaches and use god as our moral compass we would not go to war, but most people do not follow god as their moral compass and thus do go to war.	those who don't have god as their moral compass are the ones who are responsible for 99% of crimes committed to humanity.
0	Apparently you thought I was claiming that pro-lifers thought that the baby's life was more valuable than the mother's life. So I clarified:	I know of no one that is pro life believes the mother should die so the baby can live.
1	We accept your forfiet. Two more to go! Once they post, this thread will be pretty much closed. I predict Penfold will go first, followed by Jo. emoticonXSmilie	There's only so many times you can try to explain something to someone when they don't bother actually reading it.
1	LOL! Dodging the problem Easyrider. So, is sidestepping the best you can do?	Easyrider: No, mankind is an incompetent mother and father for butchering their own unborn.
0	Still clueless and still presenting a barrel of laffs I see. Have someone that can read and comprehend spell it out for you. I bet yer mun is considering that to get you out of the basement. How's the weight loss coming by the way?	An immaculately presented response, entirely avoiding the topic, or indeed reason, in order to unwittingly further the case for retrospective abortion.
0	Oh never mind that such a condition would be toxic...not to mention that no ice cores support such magical ideas.	I went to a presentation of Creation Science once and this 80 year old "archaeologist" told me that before the flood, the atmospheric pressure of the planet was double what it is now and that the oxygen content was higher.
0	economically it is great. heck, it would even be better if robots did all our jobs for us at almost no expense. sure the corporations would be fine with that because they would profit but what about the average person who cannot find a job? sending jobs over seas doesn't hurt our economy but it doesn't help billy who lost his job to it. i'm not suggesting that we stop outsourcing jobs but i am suggesting that while our jobless rate increases that our government do something to keep some jobs here.	you should have added who you would vote for if you could vote.... if i stick a point for bush in it taints the results!
0	a cop tried that in school and got sued and lost, a private individual will get sued for assault, and false imprisonment at the least. there are more cases each day but one thing the justices did mention was marbury v madison. you can ignore an illegal law with impunity. we have the ruling. we also have past cases quoted in the h eller and mcdonald cases. you implied there were none and that is false. would you like to take a stab at nunn v, state of georgia for instance? star gazer cited a lower court ruling that the gun grabbers used just as sinjin used an earlier, oveturned case in people v zirillo. how can you miss so much?	unfortunately until lower court cases build precedent to show that firearms ownership is a civil right and will be treated as such there is nothing that can be done when private individuals choose to prohibit firearms on said property.
1	what a shocker. let me paraphrase: anyone: not following you aa, can you support or clarify what you're saying here? aa: nope!	nah, it isn't worth the effort if you can't make the connection.
1	And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work.	Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which, ironically enough, is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops.
1	If it did that, then you might have won an argument by now.	But why would I expect you to get that.
0	can you think of the mental trauma of having your rapists baby? and then caring for it? for rape victims, no i still don't think abortion should be the first choice, but it should be available.	if you consider abortion to be murder, just why do you support murder in specific cases.
1	It's a self-defeating question. You're asking why numbskulls participate in numbskullery.	But how can you be against a proven method of reducing abortions at the same time?
0	I'm glad you made the same correlation I did. ToE is a substitute for #### in this case.	For example "Big Jimmy just found out Sly Jones was sleeping with his wife, the #### is really going to hit the fan now!
0	So you've gone from evolution and ID to cosmology. You have a real problem with maintaining established realms. ID addresses evolutionary theory, not abiogenesis, and not cosmology.	So where did we come from?
1	No, actually, we don't.   I suppose it's pointless to ask someone who would speak for God to not tell me what I know.	Ok, we all know that human beings were created in the image of God.
0	That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful.	Liberals don't give a damn about individual freedom; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life.
0	very much so i am surprised. i'm usually a totally cynical realist.	surprised that you can find the silver lining in things?
1	your truth?? your truth???? does it come in singles or in a bundle? do i get some sort of discount for being agnostic, that's halfway between theist and atheist, ja? does it cost extra to buy the 'be judgmental and condescending, and you will enter heaven' version, or can i just buy the 'i have so many flaws, but when they are exposed or i'm out of hand, i'll just fall back on jesus, and that makes me perfect and whole' one? nah, i'll be satisfied with 'the truth that i know is truth, not faith. let's just skip the faith process.' that hits the spot!	if what i believe is true, and it is; and i really felt about gays as you say i do, then why would i tell you about the good news of salvation in the hope of spending eternity with you ?
1	Being put in a cell with Howard Dean for life? emoticonXCry	I had the impresion that the death penalty was the worst we had to offer.
0	So,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?Sure,if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion,no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume "armed citizens" would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not.	What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics, in today's modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint, the terrain was different, the people are more hardened, the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians, the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves, had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide, plan and attack, only had to defeat, on the majority, other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross, the Russians were under funded and their moral low, the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire, china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence, Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces, the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S., it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America, and, finally, the afgans didn't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands, but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan, the americans would be defended their homeland.
1	OK, where do we start? The NAACP. Affirmative Action? UNCF? Miss Black America? emoticonXRolleyes	Muslims/Africans/Scots/English/American etc we are all the same human beings but with different beliefs and racism is a disgusting thing and needs to be abolished!
1	Can cause aggression, does not mean that it will though. Alcohol has a far greater record of this but yall are not trying to ban that. So do women but we arent going to ban them now are we, Sorry but I was in a marriage from hell and just had to throw that in.	It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
0	We share a border with Mexico. The drug cartel is armed with missile and grenade launchers. But when was the last time 72 of our police officers were murdered on American soil, in a single day, at a single location?   The countries with the greatest number of legal gun ownership, they're absent these mass killings that take place on a regular basis. There's no rebels in America killing entire cities worth of people without opposition; not even in the small towns that're without a local police force.   Explain that one away.	there might be even more such attacks in the us if the us shared a border with pakistan.
0	That's obviously not what is said. The sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.	Their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature, uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available.
0	It's not about how she treated cops. It's about how cops treated her as an American citizen with rights.	she believes she can treat cops like she did and doesn't really care what reaction they have because she will use it as an excuse to sue them.
0	This is more of a legal question involving whether or not it was negligence(sp). If so, you can't really sue for amounts of money you MIGHT get in the future. He could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedures. So ya know :). I don't really know what the question is.	Jack's religion or other views preclude getting the operation, so he sues Bob for $200,000, the wages he'll lose over the next ten years.
1	Since you're so fond of reporting personal attacks to the mod, maybe someone should return the favor to you? emoticonXRolleyes	Maybe that's your problem.As to me defending gays, I am friends with several, and basically feel disgusted at the way they are treated by people like you and the way they are denied the same rights of marriage that I just obtained with my husband.
1	Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....	So we're not in the mood to discuss future restrictions that won't be used either.
0	I'll address the later question. They may not "need" teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't "useful", they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case.	http://www.imagequest3d.com/cgi-bin/...c&tt=&bool=andHow did the anglerfishes evolve their rods and lures?...and why do they need such big teeth?
0	Actually Electro, do you remember this thread?   Evidence for a flood? Oddly enough it took 20 pages before one of them even tried to argue against the reasons why the flood did not occur.	you have so few arguments that you're repeating yourself, mainly because you don't even read the tripe that you post.
1	The penis is not designed for the hand?so you want this entire board to believe you don't wank off! Oh come on.....get real...everybody does it...who are you kidding....You lost all crediblity right there!	You want to talk about logic, try this: The penis is designed to enter the vagina, it is not designed for the mouth, hand, anus, or any where else you care to mention, think about it, it is logical.
0	A master baiter like you should present your thesis to be taken seriously, you haven't and you aren't.	So what developed nations have lower murder rates than the US?
1	are you illiterate or just stupid? when you try to use biblical passages dishonestly and out of context in order to convince people that god would favor an economy without social programs when, in fact, the exact opposite is clearly true, then you have perverted the word of god in the service of selfishness and greed. this aint hard.	didn't he say in a previous post: 'you have perverted the word of god in the service of selfishness and greed.'?
0	There's a distinct difference... so what? No baby at any age can live outside the womb. It still needs care and attention like any other. This difference in age doesn't mean anything.	But viability outside another human being is a clearly distinct difference between a zygote and a new-born baby.
0	So they had guns that could shoot down planes even before they had planes?   Their primitive muskets were that powerful? I am not that easy to fool!	i've yet to see any proof at all that a plane could be hit, let alone actually be blown out of the sky, with a single shot from the .50 bmg.
0	The purpose of the Bill of Rights.  Preamble to the Bill of Rights	Rights Retained by the PeopleAside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those.
1	EasyRider just doesn't like gay men trying to shove it down his throat! emoticonXAngel	Actually that's not what he said, but if we are going to bring it to gay relationships I've yet to see homosexuals campaign against heterosexual relations.
0	So any long publication must be due to a panic attack? It takes a few minutes to read those posts, but it takes an hour and a half to watch Expelled; does that mean that IDers are having the mother of all panic attacks?Your logic can't even be described as "tortured," marc, because it's completely nonexistent.	Yes, panic attacks are sparking many very long winded rants.
1	but the question is can you prove your belief system is true? and all you've done is spew hate for religion but haven't even tried to actually answer the question. and ask yourself this. if the idea of god is such a man made plague, then god doesn't even exist right ? so if god doesn't exist then what has he done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer.	and how many indigenous peoples around the planet would have continued to survive and thrive unmolested by what i consider the evilest of all manmade plagues, religion.
1	But you still feel they have the right idea when it comes to firearms?	Since they are issued by the military I would think so.
1	Ever hear of artificial ensemination? Why is that heteros only think there is one way to produce children? I find hetero sex disturbing,and an unnatural lifestyle choice.	You say that homosexual relationships should be all that there should be because hetero sex is wrong.
0	All born children, and every woman had the right to be rid of them. Killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb (during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur, at least). They are not comparable.	If McDonagh's and Thompson's arguments work, these parents should be released from jail because they bear no more obligation towards their own children than they do to strangers across town or burglars who break into their house.
1	You mean like Korea? Oh wait we are still there....  Is Israel a nice secure place safe from terrorism? The notion that Iraq will be without conflict will not occur in our life time.	i don't agree with us being in iraq but now that we shattered their security, we have to fix it again.

1	hunter, would you be interested in actually discussing this logically? or do you simply wish to toss out empty assertions and run away when challenged? if your view is the truth, then you have no reason to run.	Ya'll can write millions of words about evolution, but what you lack is the proof of one discovery of transitional fossils The fact of the matter is that God created man in his own image.

0	And Stephen Hawking, the only thing he has said was "I do not believe in a personal god", which would make him a pantheist or deist at best.	Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people.
0	Oh deary me, no. Where do I even start?The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :)	The bacteria works on a microscopic level and couldn't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on.
1	I see. So you actually reject all of science and still are willing to use a computer and the Internet. Don't you know that you are being led astray by your IBM processor?	Science has lead us astray for decades, and now it's coming back to bite them.

1	Winning any political election has never been about electing the "best" man for the office, it simply means you appeal to the majority of people that showed up to vote. Smartest and most popular aren't necessarily the same person, if you went to school you probably remember that. ;)	Did only the "liberal" city-folk and Hollywood incest droppings get to vote?If you believe that Moore's film is the best because it got the most votes, then you must believe that Bush is the best, because he did, too.

1	It's sophomoric remarks like that that hurt the gay cause in America.   God isn't mocked, though. And I doubt the people are either.   And I'm glad California outlawed the sin. The only thing you have left is to hope the far left, spiritually-stunted judges in the US Supreme Court are pro Sodom and Gomorrah.	Hooray it is about time.
0	finally an other conservative in this site. i mean who do these people think they are? trying to pass amendments like the fairness act. but i'm not surprised that some order is coming back to are leaders. when the government swings to far to one side, (in this case left) its ganna swing back to the other side, we just as conservatives, need to make sure we don't go to right, or we'll have done just as bad as the liberals.	hopefully the democrats will finally get the message that we don't want their freaking liberal ideas.
1	Oh, I think they ought to creat this superstate and we Americans will REALLY have a big laugh. Go for it. I need the levity.

0	hold on there. have you read the amendment? if all of our legistlators passed laws based on single incidents, our nanny government would be exponentially more intrusive than it already is.  now i don't know this woman's story any more than you do. all you know is that at least one defense contractor has a clause in it's employee contract banning an employee from shoooting for the brass ring in a jury trial. it doesn't state that the rapists can't be prosecuted.	but then, women are nothing but disease in your eyes.

Two witnesses are, one of which is Himself, which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing.	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.- John 5:31I am one that bear witness of myself...- John 8:18[Jesus was the speaker in both of these quotes]

1	So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.	Toxic gases, giant ash clouds, thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there's anything approaching an eruption, it's not a pretty picture.
1	Archie, you have said so many incorrect things about evolution on this thread that it's hard to know where to begin.

0	You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.As I said, I may just be being nit-picky.

Now as I gaze at the night sky with all its' bits and pieces spinning around each other I can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall.

1	so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? same with developmental biology? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community? the reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else. tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?	it's still a matter of determining which genomes survive into the next generation, and if genes that have 'learned' how to cooperate are better survivors than those that compete too aggressively, then darwinian theory predicts they should increase their frequency in the population.

1	And creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false.	By the way, my personal opinion is that real scientists are trying to be objecticve and actually explore something before completely trashing it.
1	emoticonXFrazzledTalk about a fast and loose accusation.WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY SAY???Cause Harry Hay is well known for his gay rights work.If Jennings did find something about the guy inspiring, it was probably his gay rights work.If I said that I thought Martin Luther King Jr was inspiring, would you automatically associate my praise with extramarital affairs?This is just stupid!	... and Jennings is on record saying he found the guy inspiring.
0	I don't see how this is not a debate about abortion. True, it's become mildly less concrete, but that's what happens when you try to get it right.	As I said in my posting #39 by splitting hairs again and again you paralyse the debate.
0	Indeed. And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists aren't allowed to disagree with "standard" theory a laugh. Clearly, evolutionary biologists disagree and those disagreements are published openly. Science makes progress by questioning and disagreement.	In all fairness, the objections did come from a well respected peer review journal, even though it may have been misconstrued or misinterpreted.
0	So it's the blog's fault that Miller sided with the creationists. Right-o, marc. (I suspect you haven't even read the blog entry in question; I'd be surprised if you've read more than a paragraph of PZ's blog.. ever.)	That one blog is a very lopsided comparison to the many examples of Miller siding with them in this book.
0	Just out of curiosity, what do you feel you could sue the company for? Descrimination? Could I sue Wal Mart or Dillons for not carrying a line of adult movies and sex toys? After all, I have a right to own adult movies and sex toys. Doesn't that mean that Wal Mart automatically has the responsibillity to provide those goods? After all, they are the biggest retailer in my area.	If the pharmacist is an employee then it's a company issue as Big Orn said although you could sue the company.
0	pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. it sounds like what you're saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender, is sexist. if not, please clarify.  pro choice does give you a choice. you can either continue the pregnancy, or seek an abortion.  the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy (barring rape, etc).  if you're joking, then ignore this.	sugar coating it doesn't change the fact that the sexist term, 'pro-choice' should be abolished and it should be replaced with what it really is, 'pro-abortion.'
0	oh really? this isnt cyber bullying. this is barely slander. you arent returning fire. this is stupid. freedom of speech isnt a two way street. you have restrictions. both legal and moral. what the hell is going on?	freedom of speech is two way street.
0	No, but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition.	Do you believe it is wrong to torture toddlers for fun?
1	I just linked you to it. (You do understand how amendments work, yes?) Note the "to lay."	Now, you tell me where they were given the power to create a Federal Welfare state.
1	Observations? Like the posts I have made? Which would be documented via quotes?....emoticonXConfused You demanded 'links' for your recurring rudeness, I produced them. I demand 'links' for my creationism.	I am stating an Opinion based on my observation and the things I have read coming out of YOUR keyboard.
0	good u not lied in 1 yr ....good progress.....but till what time.....? life can show any moment at any time......no one knows about it....not lieing is good but sometimes your truth can kill or hurt someone dear.....	because people: can't admit their faults, can't tell others theirs, want to look good to their peers; and because people are selfish...i really find it pathetic...this is why i stopped lying when i was young, because i saw how much everyone else did it, and just saw it as pathetic, and didn't want to be like everyone else...i haven't lied in 1 year.
1	I guess you never thought that many Cathoilics have gays in their family, or should they ask them to take their lives ?	Of course, you have the right to support them, but don't try to make it sound as if you aren't making a conscious choice to do so.
1	Your problem is that you take the Bible as the Literal Word of the Invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is NOT. There are other "Sins' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as I that Jesus did not change the Laws. If you want others to live by your False book of fairy tales it would be a Good Idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first. Choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish.	If one takes these Scriptures seriously, homosexuality will be recognized as an evil.
0	You are a known anti-gun supporter, should we really be surprised at your presidential choice. Funny thing is, you are going to get screwed just like the rest of us if Obama wins. He might try to take our guns away, but your rights that are important to you wont be very far behind.	If only McCain were anywhere near his equal, it might be a contest.
0	No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here.	i am trying to show that in fact the crime rate is increasing, not that there is more than a change in how it is reported.
1	So who do you hold responsible for forcing people to stay at the convention center to die? Lemme guess.Should they be held criminally negligent? I'm sure the "bipartisan" commission will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable.	Uhhh, in case you haven't noticed, the workers in the nursing home have been charged with several count of criminally negligent homicide.
0	Honest question Arch: where is the problem with a potential variance of 10 billion years? I know this question may appear ridiculous to you but could you take the question in the spirit it was meant?	If they have any evidence, why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room?
0	Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.The whole concept of "reap what you sow" is a CHRISTIAN concept.And now you're claiming it's flawed?While I feel the need to continually reiterate that what this guy did in harming others was WRONG (primarily to avoid the trolls from misrepresenting my point), the validity of the generic concept of "reap what you sow" is amazingly poignant.People typically don't just go nuts and harm people for no reason.Columbine saw the kids trying to harm other kids who harassed them.While some people may be jumping the gun in trying to assign "sowing", I am also amazed that others are so unwilling to inspect the question of whether or not the church involved truly did "sow"...	Would you agree that the logic is flawed in both cases?
0	You know 'my kind'? How very presumptuous on your part. Then you know individual choice is the issue, not enforced medical procedures. You didn't answer the question regarding pregnant women who intend to carry to term being required to have a sonogram.	Do you now suggest people don't go to College because it too is yet another EXPENSE.
0	It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have.	Until Intelligent Design can come up with evidence, as well as any potential advantage to the science community to ID, it will be nothing but a religious belief.
1	i will ask you yet again who these nefarious 'gay lobbist' are that you continually refer to? how do you define 'lobbist'. merriam-webster on line dictionary http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=lobbyists are you not yourself a 'lobbyist'? many times one thinks of a lobbyist as one who is paid to present a particular point of view. with that in mind: 1) are you receiving wages during the time you spend reading and posting on this forum? i am not. 2) is the person or organization paying you those wages aware of the nature your activities here in this forum? 3) does the person or organization paying you those wages advocate the nature of your opinions and activities expressed here in this forum? 3) are you using equipment or facilities provided by some other person or organization to read and make postings here?	if you don't like analogies, i will be sure and point that out the next time a gay lobbyist here uses one, such as comparing gay marriage to interracial marriage (such as when invoking the loving case).
0	Should it be legalized? Only if every other country did itIs it harmful? Yes more so then moderate alcohol use and worse then smokingShould it be taxed once legalized? Yes.Should laws still apply to it, such as DUIs and the like? Yes.	No, not nearly as much as alcohol or tobacco.Should it be taxed once legalized?
1	This will kill innovation. do you know how many years a start up business might be in the red before it generates a profit? Why bother when you know you are going to be clubbed as soon as you realize a profit? Yep, way to incentivize business there...	There are laws against profiteering and any company that is making more then 60% profit is profiteering.
0	i see. i just never came through to see it as worth the buy. i guess i borrow a friends copy.	i can personally say all three of the uncharted games are well worth the buy.
0	(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?	for faith has no merit where reason has proof from experience.
0	i don't :( tell me, inbox me if you don't want to say it in front of other's.  i am surprised i thought you would be to holy to have lust.	i think everyone knows who i have a crush on.
0	i am surprised at your response since i see your posts as well considered and stated. i asked the question and you answered. to me it was clearly, by definition, inflammatory. we can agree to disagree and let readers make their own determination.	only those who want to see saddam as a martyr will do so.
1	And irrational emotional appeals seldom hold up in the face of logic	Averages tend not to mean much when 14 kids are laying dead in a school.
1	Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that "...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed." Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts.	Why are we told that Darwin's theory of evolution is a scientific fact -- even though many of its claims are based on misrepresentations of the facts?
1	Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means? Also that's what jeans were called before the word "jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?) So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies? Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment.	Besides you are very much an exception to the rule.
0	I don;t really know anything about british gun control in colonial india, and don't really see it's relevance, since colonial india is gone. I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army. This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule. The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).	The context of 'depriving of the whole nation of arms' was the refusal of the British to conscript Indians into the British Army during the First World War.
0	would you consider yourself philosophical? no, i don't think philosophy is useful. everything they claim that cannot be supported by science is simple word games, like the ontological argument. lolzor is the first person i have discussed philosophy with ever, and i'm not impressed with philosophy's lack of demonstrative capabilities.	it never occurred to me, me a person who wonders why god doesn't just stop rape, that because he can't exist in all worlds that he's not omnipotent.
1	Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making.	So the main disagreements between fundamentalists and theistic evolutionists are what are, and are not first (primary) causes.
1	Yes, we shouldn't let those slaves be citizens, they will burden our legal system since they will now have...OMG...rights!	It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody, property, inheritance, etc.,
1	Sounds like an abortion bill amendment to restrict all travel by minors is needed by those demanding that young girls give birth after being impregnated by rapists, fathers, uncles, etc. Might as well include adults, just to simplify matters and enhance state police power. Bubbah will be pleased.	Can minors buy plane, train, bus tickets?
0	The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true.	These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ?
1	Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions? Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?	Can you guarantee that what appears to be a simple mugging will come to an immediate halt once the mugger is complied with, and that he won't push for more than mere material goods?
1	When's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime? And don't you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone?	I have never had a fire in my kitchen but I still keep a fire extinguisher in there.
1	Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing as you make unfounded claims without supporting them with even the slightest proof. But hey, talks cheap; and you've proven you've got plenty of that since showing up here.	Wouldn't put it past them to Photoshop those pictures just for 'shock' value emoticonXRolleyes
0	Welcome back PeterV. We now have self defense laws from 3 different states posted in this thread. Is there one you approve of more than the others, or perhaps you have a different view altogether you would like to share with us? Please feel free to enter the discussion.	Yes, it's certainly interesting to see gun advocates embracing more "progressive" notions about justifiable homicide (such as Texas' laws) while gun control advocates are clinging to more traditional ideas about acceptable self defense.
1	If you need a decision made for you, ask me. I'll be glad to. Be prepared to raise your child though.	Eases the conscience if you just vote for someone to make life's tough decisions for you.
0	But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with "philosophical pronouncements" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond "atheistic philosophical pronouncements."	... here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters".
1	Like the crusades and the inquisition? How about the Southern Baptist Convention, formed at the end of the Civil War with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks? And of course, the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you. Of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't. But when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so I just never turn my back on them. That way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, I will at least have my eye on my money.	For those who are in Christ the tendancy is to be pulled towards good decisions.
0	well...., i hope you're kidding because i don't think that's a fair assessment.	i know what your point of view for everything is.
0	alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?	um, in the debate description it talks about how marx predicted that laissez faire capitalism would lead to an the nation being ruled by an elite few, which would cause the working majority to revolt.
0	i do agree. the rot started here when thatcher came to power, and became chronic when neil kinnock became leader of the labour party. now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. the actions of the ecb in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. i think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. :p george monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book age of consent. i'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though.	if you agree on that level then we do agree for once.
0	http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-chr053006.php but what does this have to do with the topic at hand?	what does this have to do with anything?
0	i'm intrigued as well, most of the bands are in the same size font, this could turn into a whole new debate!!	perhaps you'd be better served to take up your complaint with google so they can track down the phantom of the font... it wasn't me:) p.s.
0	You can't...only admin can...and there's no need to be sorry.	If there's a way to delete this thread, I'll be pursuing it.
1	she? uh, you don't know me like that, miss thing. you're the one with more pudenda than the pointer sisters. and i'm not eating any attention. i'm mildly amused. i haven't seen any evidence of your reputed prowess here. and why don't you ask the real monkey to dance? somebody at home.	now grind on the organ and watch the monkey dance some more.
1	But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is. What it isn't is an explosion. I don't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang, have you?	society which accepts the idea that the origin of the cosmos could be explained in terms of an explosion, reveals more about the society itself than about the universe.
1	Anything to get around doing things the normative way ... emoticonXDonno	I see you haven't thought about it much.
0	So when you're doing math, you're an atheist? Of course not. Just because there is overlap doesn't mean that the two views are identical.	It does mean they are all the same, concerning mathematics.
0	How is that related to deterrence?       Once again, deterrence is preventing through the fear of consequences.      What you are talking about is not related to the subject of deterrence.	--------------------------------------------------------------------------  I do not believe that the supreme court adressed the the problem of convicted fellons having the death penelty reduced to life in prison and going on to kill in prison.
0	What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth? Have you no regard for them?	This thread has established the cold disregard for undeserved pain and death inflicted upon what would be a child created by the irresponsible acts of humans.
1	I see you missed the entire point of my post. Good job on analyzing the sarcastic opening though.	Hamilton is actually arguing in favor of what Article 1 of the Constitution says about the militia in that quote.
1	Thanks for that little ad hominem! Shall I share with you my guesses about your motives?... But I digress.	I am frustrated because as I said before the attack on co-option requires that you keep several premises in mind and it for some reason (am guessing sub-conscious avoidance) --
1	Interesting, this is the same type of angry rants that Capo used to post on the abortion debates before he was banned. How interesting that you should get so angry and worked up over such an innocent exchange between me and chloe.	Yesterday my Pastor said the same exact thing in church, and for the same reason.And so he should, if so he believes.I would like to ask your pastor how many children (s)he has adopted.
0	becasue tehre is no merit to the behavior that would need special recognition. should people with attachment disorders be allowed to be polygamists? what is so special about homosexuality that it deserves to be treated different than other behaviors? remember there is no definitve evidence that it is genetic.	federal funding of social programs, islam, religion in general, eating meat, etc, etc... we tolerate these things because they are beneficial to, or the free choice of some, while not coming at the expense of others (except maybe the social programs jp.
1	Wasn't that you spewing "facts" that had no content and were incorrect? gee, what do you wanna be when you grow up?	What has this to do with my mental age?
1	you'd be hard-pressed to get me to agree with your definition of 'conservative' . and i'd love to tell them. do you have their e-mail addresses? i'll start with chickenshit kennedy.	you want to tell them that ?
1	Better still , you pop down to your local army barracks and explain it to thememoticonXClown	Explain to us how the ones who profit from this scenario are arseholes, while the poor saps who give their lives and lose their livelihoods for nothing are not.
0	no dear! how can we foget about the people who have opened the old age homes for those whose sons have left them? those are real humans!see, we cannot be so pessimistic to look at the negative side,even if the real humans are surrounding us, the brightness of sun cannot be hidden by the patches of clouds	their is nothing lyk emotions... :( what centrl goverment did in ramlila maidaan...?
0	But not just any seven judges, seven judges who's job is to define the constitution.	Abortion is a right constructed in the chambers of the minds of seven judges.
1	Yes, it's been supressed. Only 14 people knew it before some brave soul tortured them until they confessed the horrible truth!!	it has been known for a long time -- it's just been surpressed because it contradicts genetic determinism and neo-darwinsm in general.
1	Oh, ok, I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better. How about I refer to them as "intelligence deficient". And I was really not referring to bona fide "retarded" individuals (those with true pathology). I agree that there is nothing funny about that. How about I refer to them as people who drive like XXXXXX...Is that better?	It's a low XXXX, IMO.I know there's an explanation for everything, that's why God isn't praised as much as He should be.I tend to thank Him for all things.
0	If Obama had his way, standing against the government would be the most patriotic thing someone could do.	Felony arrest, severe mental illness or disturbance (like the kind that gets you off of felony murder charges because you were found not competent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect), drug addiction, or treasonous action against the country (not the current government, but the country itself).
0	you're joking right? that's not even close. here's the verse just in case you read something else, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt with that: 1 corinthians 13:3: if i give away all i have, and if i deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, i gain nothing. this does not mean 'but not loved for it', but showing love.	but it doesn't say that, it says if i am charitable but not loved for it, then helping others is pointless.
0	i agree, it is we that it is ridicules that we have gotten so into controlling stuff that now we even have a way to control natural courses, but i guess like i said before if it is to stop your child from suffering a sickness then i guess that is okay (still bad) but better than just being a complete control freak, or being selfish	i think its interesting to learn about how you do and stuff, but if people can go around and choose their children's gender, the world is seriously screwed up.
1	I think that is true of so many things. Wanna screw something up royal? -- add humans.  I heard once that a gallon (or maybe is was a barrel) of Coca Cola (syrup) is more expensive than the same amount of oil. Things that make you go hmmm.	because it is not so much the capitalist theory that is the problem as it is our implementation of it.
1	Not to speak for Jim, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess it was "Rebuttlickan". Just a hunch.	Jim,Just which of my descriptos of Hizzonor Mayor Rudy did you find to be pejorative?
1	Archie, you're not one of those Westboro Baptist Chuch types, are you? You don't buy that stuff about 'God Hates the ### Army' and 'God hates America' do you?	How about this from your #148 in Gay Rights:I have spoken of the coming judgment that America is facing because of our iniquity and you are proving just how deserving we are of it with your rebellious and condemning attitude towards the God who holds your very life in His hands.
1	leroyjames, i am just shocked at your blatantly sarcastic response to kelly ;)	not yet, but my cat and dog have been working on it for years.
0	Actually I'm so sure of my manhood that even though I knew that charge would be levelled against me I still posted anyway. Anyway if you feel that men need to be degraded to make up for past actions to women you have gone from "righteous" to bitter.	Women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries.
1	I did, you rejected my evidence with your usual excuses. Now, tell me about the big bang.	That doesn't make it actually true.Tell me again about the flood layer Archie.
1	And this coming from a so called, self proclaimed "rational christian" ? It appears you have blown your cover as a poser by showing your true colors as an anti-christian atheist and a hatemonger. Thanks for revealing your true Nature. emoticonXGood	Christianity supports genocide, infanticide, ethnic cleansing, filicide, burning of human beings, and the slaughter of gays.And boy, if I said that out of this current argument, you and Archie and Jims would be all over me.
0	It is pretty bizzare. There are plenty of groups out there that will reach whatever "conclusion" you pay them to reach. Why he didn't cite one of them instead of an easily checkable source that says the opposite of what he says they do is beyond me.	Not sure what he is talking about.
0	There's no adding of firearms going on, because they're already there! The criminals have them, that's a hard fact of life that can't ever be changed. Deal with it. What we want is for the intended victims to be on equal footing with the bad guys. There's nothing unreasonable about that.	Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse.
0	A being is something that is conceivable as existing...or something that actually exists.A human being is one of us, a homo-sapien, a member of the group of beings known as animals.A rock is a being of inanimate qualities.God is the supreme being, not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him (or It, or She) on the same level as those that He created.We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!God is great.God is good.Let us thank Him for our food.God is my shepherd.God is my Light.God is my Co-pilot.God is what keeps me from believing that all this (the totality of all things and happenings) came about by accident.When God made man, She was only kidding! ;)	...God does not fill the word "who" because to most accounts he is not a person, or being....
0	So 5,000 to 10,000 women dying from illegal abortions isn't high? Dude, that is nearly five times the number of women who were dying from abortions in the 1940s! That is VERY high!	The figure comes from a 1936 study by Dr. Frederick Taussig who estimated that abortion claimed the lives of 5,000 to 10,000 women a year.
0	And he has still yet to provide one. If more gun-control means more lives saved then more gun-control means more self preservation.	And you STILL have yet to provide one.
0	oh yeah! i remember you man! welcome back. oh, thethinker may be gone but there's a few whack-jobs who have taken his place.	i don't know why though, i would of had better luck arguing with a wall.
0	the fetus would be a real person...and it seems like....in order to make the iraq war/abortion connection....you would have to support the war!	But, I guess that when one worships the Almighty Fetus, the lives of real people are of no concern.
0	anyone who serves in the military is a hero. once you sign on the dotted line and take that oath, you are allowing for the possibility for death by combat at anytime. perhaps others didn't get the recognition she got, but that's not her fault. the media needed a 'darling of enduring freedom' poster child and she got picked.	to think she was any more a hero than any other serviceman or woman on the front lines is ludicrous, and to tell the truth, many of them arent heroes either.
1	lol just can't keep a good thing down can you gans? i love how it is only you and archie who have flocked to the thread in utter dismay... i'm sure easy will be right behind carrying a crucifix to ward off the 'gay'..... and no i do not think it will be overturned and i am ecstatic that marriage equality has extended to our nations capitol. let freedom ring baby!!!!	is this likely to be overturned or are congratulations really in order?
0	oh yeah, i went to see the new movie a couple of weeks ago, it's probably the most interesting film i have seen in a long time. i actually bought the book because of the movie and i am going to read it sometime in the near future. looking forward to it!	it does take off slow but the story is amazing and the freaking new movie blew my dick off it was so amazing
1	Nothing anyone has said has proven anything I have said wrong in any way because all you have are unprovable and unproven assumptions. Now go over to the other debate Creation versus evolution like a good little boy and you will get my response to Tiktaalik. Nkaaaay?	All these posts proving Archie wrong, and not one example of his acknowledging this fact has EVER BEEN FOUND!
1	as steve martin once said, 'well, ecuuuuuuse meeeee'. no polar icecaps today? ok what is the proper - pc terminology - that refers to the big chunk of ice, what sits over the top of the north and south regions of the planet? as long as it is not too long of a description or too lame - i can evolve to the next phase and say ...(thus and such)... instead. :) btw. iam sure that algore can remember the meaning of - 'polar icecaps'. sorry that, you can not.	i'm kinda sorry i challenged smallax on this issue, but i'm pretty sure that gore knows there aren't icecaps at the north pole.
1	the evidence that is provided to you is not enough. not that evidence is not given.  nice closed-minded-ness buddy.  ethnocentrism? lol! you're kidding right? you think what i wrote is particular and not broad ranged? what are you assuming here?	creationism is a theory that is taken as fact without any actual factual basis.
1	Says the man who wants to criminalize being a victim of a crime. :)	Says the man that believes locking your front door is sufficient to secure weapons inside.
1	Hey Matt, if that paintbrush were any broader, you could paint a room in just five minutes	If you don't want to speak out then don't complain that someone is basing their opinion of all evangelicals by phelps's actions.
0	That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do.	Perhaps when the Roman Catholic Church has cleansed itself of its own sins it could have a dialogue with women about abortion--WHICH IS NOT A SIN.
1	You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind.	I was requested to start a new thread in which pro-gay and anti-gay marriage positions could be debated without posters being called "homophobes", "gay bashers" and "bigots" simply because they don't favor gay marriage.While I"ve already stated why I'm against gay marriage in previous threads, I'll reiterate them here for newbies and for simplicity sake.1.
0	Too much spin there buddy. The potentiality arguement is used by those who believe women have a right to have control over their fertility. As an aside it is also a fundemental tenent in Judaism's view of the unborn- the foetus is a potential life, but has not yet attained that state of being, which occurs at birth.	The potentiality argument is often used against those who do not believe that a fetus is worthy of being called a person, a human, or whatever word you prefer to argue over.
0	Sigma I have taken into account the options a woman has after pregnancy. However, there are no doubt cases in the history of the world (not just within America) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child (ie: the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world). For this pro-choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation. Are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her?	That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway).
0	Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfmIt is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something.	The CBO estimate was ~$1Billion/ year in additional costs for legalizing 600,000 gay marriages.
1	Ah! So wellspoken for an addle-pated twiddle poop! I congratulate you!  And a total lie! Who the Hades wants 13-year-old children to be sexually active? No responsible, thinking person could wish such a thing. You malign Planned Parenthood.  You have ceased to be a credible commentator on this issue.	planned parenthood can't wait to get 13 year old girls on the table to abort their babies..........
1	Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste.	Finally, it just makes sense....it makes physiological change smooth, simple and economical, with minimal waste (death.)
0	you are a very good student of buddha. i am very impressed.	they may not call it buddhism but they are most certainly are buddhist principles repackaged in other forms.
1	Ah yes, the ever popular 3rd grade "they started it" response. Didn't jesus say to turn the other cheek?	"We are only reacting to the violence that is already there in that religion."
1	What makes you think I don't. Yours is not the only religion on earth!! And I didn't just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern, so don't jump to it with me.	It is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul, not how many years you can stay on the earth.
1	Coveting is the basis for capitalism. Without coveting, there is no motivation!	How is following the 10 commandments an interpretation of Christianity or scriptures.Don't murder, don't steal, don't covet, how are those even considered to be interpretable?
1	Just out of interest, which particular aspect of "truth" are you getting at here?	It really does make one wonder though, if there is really nothing to hide, why are pro-abortionists so desperate to hide and mask the truth about abortion?
0	Given that I do not hold that opinion, I would challenge you show where I have stated such.	Even with the Supreme Court ruling, Sinjin and Chet have said otherwise... on the day this was posted!

0	Actually both are relative in every situation. Especially "The Truth" as espoused by religious fundamentalists such as yourself, as there are as many different versions of the truth as there religious fundamentalists.	Truth and morality are not relative to any given situation.
0	Both. It's where a human life begins but not a life yet.	Do you believe that a fetus in a women's body is just undeveloped tissue or a start in where human life begins?
0	Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition, however inadequately, this doesn't mean they're going to recommend crackpot "raw food" dietary schemes to prevent destructive "lamarckian evolution" on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats.	Doctors should be schooled in nutrition so they can teach their patients how to cure themselves.
0	No offense, but I am in my early teens and understand the situation more than you.	I am in my late teens.
1	774 billion to china in debt... where are you going to 'buy' new technology? oh right... from china.	while china has more troops, they don't have the equipment to utilize those troops.
0	oh yeah, i don't disagree. i'm a massive fan of hitchens, and 99% of everything he said was true. he just happened to be, as you say, misguided on certain issues.	a misguided view on foreign policy is bad, but (by your own admission necesary) criticism of those who lack it and a fierce dedication to free speech wouldn't mean hitchens ' failed when applying it to politics' utterly.
0	Well this involves the free will / determinism debate, you say you aren't free if your preferences are implanted... I say you are free when you act in accordance with your preferences, regardless of how those preferences were arrived at. I think to claim you need to "choose" your preferences is absurd, as the act of choosing requires prior preferences, which presumably also required a choice.... and the question of how we acquired our first preference arises...	If you can inject me with something that compels me to seek out and drink a coke, then I am not acting freely, and if I am not choosing to act in a certain fashion, then intelligence is not involved, at least not directly, in what I do.
0	I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.	For example an animal might have developed a wing like appendage, but it wouldn´t have the correct muscles that it would need to actually move the wings.
0	Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?	Oh, you might eventually come across a vegetable who isn't able to breed, but I submit that 99.99% of all humans can do so.
1	You put such confidence in articles written by partisan plebes, using unsupported, irrelevant links to make the printed text pseudo-intelligent. I cannot imagine you holding your own in a serious debate.

0	i was awake, just not on at the time you posted this. high school starts waaaayyy to early. anyway, i'm surprised at how many people post while i'm asleep (around 11:30 - 5:30 est)	the mornings are so quiet for us europeans.
1	I don't think it's a cover-up. I think that it's a conspiracy between the black helicopters and the aliens beaming suggestions to those without the foil-lined hats on. :)	Thats why the Republicans have brainwashed you in to think that way.
1	Have you stopped beating your wife yet?  Give it up! Good grief! emoticonXDonno	do you think it does gays a disservice?
0	It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)	It doesn't matter to me either way because the Constitution allows the states to do as they wish regarding abortion.
1	Ha.a.a.a :p emoticonXGood Good one, sinjin.  What is the sound of one hand clapping.....?  Ladywolf,  Your answer will probably come from many different sources. Your idea that it evolved is pretty-much it, IMO.	i have no facts but would speculate it was more about punishing those who chose not to marry(rogues) than the other way around.
0	And if we can actually doing anything about it. From what I hear on the fringes, the debate should not be about how to change or stop it, but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate.	The controversy is over whether it's man-made or not.
1	Look, the "no one was around to see it" argument. "If a tree falls in the woods, and no one was around to see it, did it really fall?" You lost this one a long time ago, too. You never learn.	In typical fashion, and because because your man made science that teaches that the big bang signified the start of time, even though their was evidently no one around to record time back then, but you automatically assume that only after the so called big bang did time begin to exist.
0	True, they can change laws if the are unconstitutional. So what makes a ban on abortion unconstitutional?   Also, what makes the dealth penalty for minors constitutional one day and not the next? In fact 15yrs ago it wasn't an unconstitutional decision. I guess now it is??? Makes no sense.   Clive14,   those are obviously not my beliefs as I think everyone is equal.   I am not sure your wealth makes you different from someone else. It means you wealth is unequal..we are talking about just people. We all end up 6 foot under (so to speak) in the end.	no, but they can change laws if they are unconstitutional.
1	How the hell can you narrow it down to three? The competition in the entire top ten is fierce.	Wow - Spetner, Sermonti, and the newest anti-evolution charlatan, Sanford -the trifecta of intellectual vacuousness.
1	And posts like yours serve no purpose other than to detract from the subject at hand. The subject at hand involves how some people choose to fear the law-abiding and feel safer with the law-breakers. You've done absolutely nothing to dispute these facts and prove them wrong.	Posts like this make baby Jesus cry.emoticonXCry
0	let's wait and see if the chain of possession comes to light.  your demand that any tightening of our firearm sales regulations must curtail all cartel bloodshed. who do you suppose the mexican president hopes to protect from guns arriving from the us?  i am prepared to offer my fingerprint every time i purchase a firearm and so should you. to exclude ourselves from those prohibited from buying.	or is it that you only hope that you can get control of the american people?
1	Yeah, ok, keep up with your "Creationist" therory and I'll stick to my much more believable idea of "Evolution." Keep your religion out of MY Government!	One, if homosexuality was a "right" thing then why wasn't 3 sets of ppl formed, such as, man/woman, woman/woman, man/man?
0	But himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which didn't migrate to the plains. And pressures from predators, climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do. My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction.	Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains.
0	Well before there was a law someone came up with a difference, I didn't ask if they end result was the same, I asked if there was a difference in the two. Maybe a moral difference or something.	Eyes fogged over no longer care whether it was fun or self defense.
1	Ah, so when I lobby for burets for my chemistry classes, I'm indoctrinating my kids into the evils of iodometry? *gasp*Yes, it's a stupid as it sounds, because it's analogous to your argument.	Here's more proof for you of the indoctrination that's taking place today in public schools, and the gay lobby bragging about how they got increased funding for their programs.
1	because gc hears things all woggly. the message from god is for shepherds to tend to ignorant, mindless sheep. but, with dope-smoker ears, and american ignorance it translates into a cowboy...who rustles cattle...and heads them to a quick slaughter. it's like, when the anti-chist makes his appearance, i'll be gods slaughterman. effectively and efficiently removing tru-believahs from the world...cause god forgot some in his rapture thingy (i forget how the logic of these events is supposed to play out...) ummm...aren't we overdue for that bloke to return already? i'm getting antsy for the 2nd coming and all the excitement that leads up to that glorious event. think holding my breath will make it happen any sooner?	after all, cowboys have the stigma of being arrogant, stubborn, oblivious to subtle cultural traits, not the delicate cautious type, so and on so forth.
0	**Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism.	What I am is someone who appreciates the value of the scientific methodology, and its repeatedly demonstrated power to yield elegant, testable, useful and predictive hypotheses, including - over the past centuries - the discovery and modeling of novel forces at work in nature as well as the Theory of Evolution.

0	Chloe, the point of this thread is to help you understand what the argument is, not to give analogies to abortion.	Abortion is dealing with the decision to end another's life in order to sustain a preferred lifestyle.

To be honest, I have mixed views on the subject, but not enough interest to read pages of reporting on the disturbing events you are referring to, especially when someone considerate enough can give me the "jist" of what happened (THANK YOU Superlite27 for that) and at the same time help others that might browse this thread.

0	As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think.	What would you investigate that you feel could further the human pool of knowledge?
0	have you ever burned a flag? have you ever urinated on a pow flag? i thought you said you never did, so i don't see how i am lambasting you for something you have never done. but do you honestly believe it is ok for any person to urinate on a pow flag just because they think they have a good reason to do it? you said it's their judgment call, right? do you see it as disrespectful or sad like i do?  just because you can, doesn't mean you should.	so you're lambasting me for doing something i have the right to do because i'm not obligated to do it?
0	Not at all. The issue is receiving the marriage benefits. If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?	"To try and compare a situation where one group has the CHOICE to use a right, and then chooses not to, to a second group that is DENIED that choice, is mind-bogglingly absurd.
0	Actually all decisions based on the self ARE selfish decisions. I really don't care. I make them all the time too. Everyone does. While this is a philosophical issue I really see it as odd that people claim not to be selfish when doing something that benefits them or prevents harm to them with little regard to anyone else.	I'm not selfish, whether you or your buddy JP like to think so or not - I just look at actual reality rather than a fantasy world.
0	Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.

0	Who said it did? I was only pointing out the absurdity of gun control laws and how they lead to federal overlords deeming that your not capable of playing with matches. (I would not be suprised if this were next.)	Rather unsurprisingly, the U.S. constitution does not have any bearing on Australian law.
0	again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. as if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.  what a sad and mean little man you are.	emoticonxrolleyes  if you can't understand the concept of sacredness, i doubt there's anything anyone will be able to tell you that would ever make a difference.
0	the blog is just the link for the article....geez, get a grip.	Anyone who can quote the Uncommondescent blog as if it were serious science obviously is clueless about evolution.
1	And why would you say something like this? Because Christianity prohibits it? I can't think of any other reason.	I would secondly say that saying that one has a constitutional right to marry is not the same thing as saying that one has the right to marry a person of the same gender.
1	I know, maybe the American criminals will just import guns in with their Mexican illegal drugs. I don't know for sure but I believe the Mexican Drug gangs wouldn't mind another revenue stream.

AN AK-47 assault rifle, a high-calibre sniper rifle and machine guns are among a large cache of weapons uncovered by police in a sting operation culminating in a series of Sydney raids.Undercover officers bought a range of illegal guns, including the AK-47, over a series of months from a targeted supplier.In a similar raid yesterday, in Powder Works Road, Elanora Heights, officers seized a large cache of weapons.

0	bin laden said on that tape that muslims should support iraq. why? iraq is secular. he shouldn't want iraq to be supported... he hates non-muslims. hmm... thistown, who cares what people think? it's a bad idea to set foreign policy by opinion polls. 85% of our population was opposed to entering ww ii before pearl harbor while hitler was killing millions, and we knew all about it. that was the wrong thing to do.  i bet the chancellor is relaxing with a cool glass of french wine waiting for his term to end...his people hate him. he's holding his stance to gain popularity, playing politics. our president blew him off, he's killed relations, and he knows it.	others (even though they wont admit it) doesn't want to go to war just because bush says we need to.
0	i guess that you didn't look at my last link. there are recalls every year that effect millions of cars, and those companies are not being bullied by the government. the point is every car company has recalls, and the government is targeting toyota. ford, gm, buick all have recalls. why are they not targeted? so, the government is the almighty paternalistic big brother punishing those bad and irresponsible companies who only care about themselves and wreck endless destruction to society and the environment. no, toyota is committed to fixing faulty accelerator only because of accusations for causing accidents.	the government bullies everybody who does something bad on a large scale.

1	That's good - so you no longer believe all actions that result in inevitable deaths are killings, only cruel ones. This is an improvement on your previous:	If a cruel action is causally linked to someone's inevitable death, they are responsible for that death.

1	Anyone speaking English could well be an illegal from the UK then, right?   I guess Puerto Ricans better watch out too.	It is reasonable to suspect anyone speaking Spanish in Arizona as being an illegal alien.
0	This argument is self-defeating. A theory is not a fact, no matter how much evidence may support the theory. Bad wording. But again, if you claim something as a fact, you must have proof, verified in both your method of reasoning, and the reasoning utilized by the person you are proving the fact to.	Too bad evolution is a scientific theory and an empirically verified fact.

0	well, i'm not surprised. the left coast rarely gets anything right. :)  btw, gm still has over 25% of the domestic vehicle market and it didn't get it by selling econoboxes like the japanese did.	the only people around here i see driving new gm products (other than p/u trucks) with temp paper plates were probably on active duty in ww2.
0	so you have no idea if any states removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement?  and i'll just answer your question then which was (as you restated) [does] anybody kn[o]w of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement. that answer is, yes, i know of a state that hard removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement.  glad i could help.	at the start, i asked if anybody knew of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement.
0	which will push crude oil prices up in line with the benchmark usd devaluation? treasury interest rates could become interesting. i'm already seeing conventional cd and money market rates on the rise.	this leads to the situation where the asian countries don't need to buy dollars as much anymore to keep their respective currencies low and might even lead to them not buying dollars anymore or even dumping them in the near future.
0	This is why arguments like "well, our population is out of control" never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay. I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments... Pro-Lifers have a priority list, and Life makes it to the top. For Pro-Lifers, it's a little like saying "Well, Big Macs taste good, so you should never, ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good!" I mean, sure, burgers taste good, but filet mignon is so much better.	"[...] the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture -- is false and illusory if the right to life, the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination."
1	atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god maybe in your mind, because you can't see a world without god. a parallel is that of a parent and child. so atheists are naughty children? and he or she then rebells to the point of extreme anger. atheists are extremely angry? oh right, like those atheist terrorists, or the atheists that campaign at the funerals of dead soldiers. atheists are just angry at god for no real reason care to prove this?	atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god.
0	And many of those countries are having problems with it. Furthermore, we aren't even proposing what other countries have.	Also as has been repeated umpteen times all the countries with universal healthcare have much lower cost per capita.
0	Homo-erectus and Neandertals had different bone structures. How could they be fully human when their anatomy is fundementally different?	that all modern day humans are descendants of Homo-erectus and Neandertals (both fully human), evolutionists have had to camoflauge this by dreaming up a new scenerio.
0	It is worse then that they just don't get it. Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority. They just don't get it.	Certainly, because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally.To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony, right, and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by....
0	correct. did you notice that in the scott peterson trial, the judge went around the law in deciding how he should be punished and who has rights? a clear sign of activism, yet none of the righties called him a activist judge even when what he did is by defintion activism. it's a sign they are hugely hypocritical.  vor's got a raging double standard if he calls some judges who do that activist and others who do the same, not.	just as the phrase politcal correctness is always used by 'consevatives' (i put them in quotes because there is a huge difference between conservatives and reactionaries that label themselves 'conservatives') to describe indignation at describing different segments of the population in insulting terms.
0	why would anyone want to use aspartame? drink tea or coffee without sweetener or sugar..you get used to it. if you are too fat then eat less.	how many of them also had added citric acid in large quantities?
0	As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to "purpose." And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase "survival of the fittest" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time "survival of the fittest" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory.	It doesn't do this, because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends'... other than survival, and survival simply come about because organisms survive (hence the tautology of "Survival of the Fittest" which Darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to "Natural Selection").
0	And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).	Just look at us and ask the question "What are we doing?"
0	But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not. It's prejudice, pure and simple, and you're no exception. Now, one would think, being the supposedly non-Christian enlightened person you are, you would simply say "oh, I didn't realize that my posts came across as anti-Christian sometimes, and that it indicates a prejudice on my part, and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking." I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking.	Of course, if you get a muslim in here making similar claims to the claims that Christianity makes, you will get an equal reaction from the same people who critize Christianity (for the exact same reasons)
1	oh, so business owners don't make 'real' contributions to society? whoa boy, slow down there. i didn't say that government offices should be passed down. what are you going to do...make inheritence illegal? you didn't read my answer obviously. just because people have money doesn't mean they have to share it. the government doesn't have the right to take money away from the rich and give it to the poor. so what if rich people don't give money to the poor! it's their choice. god tells us to give money to the poor, but he also gave us a free will. it's not the governments responsibility to help the poor, it's the church's responsibility.	i think most people do not really understand the differences between the two.
0	wow :) i'm just a starter, that's my first big tattoo (the debate picture, sorry about the glare, i had another sitting friday and it was lathered in tattoo goo!) i've had 5 hours on it so far, still got so long left but it's going to be a 3/4 sleeve once finished.	i love tattoos, i've got three so far, a dragon that takes up my right calf, a tribal design on my back and darwin's tree of life on the inside of my left forearm modified to include family initials at branch points with the 'i think' wording on top at my wrist, i also had it thickened up to make it look less like a squiggly hand sketch.
1	I can see that you're as impressed by PZs propaganda as an infant is with a pacifier Collin, but I'm not. emoticonXFrazzled emoticonXBye	PZ just happened to write a post on his blog today about the "interpretation" argument creationists have been peddling a lot lately, and the very end happens to mention the RATE project, actually.
0	i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic.	as to the idea of your question my non beleif comes from the lack of evidence and logic in support of god as well as a lack of understanding of what is meant by 'god'.
1	I've decided that I will answer this question once and for all if someone can prove to me why people need tennis racquets. If someone can answer this for me, I will attempt the definitive assault weapon response. Have at it.	but who really needs an assult rifle anyway
1	Yeah, the lesbians. emoticonXRolleyes It would also mean the end of the human race. emoticonXGood	I can think of at least one in this forum.
1	I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant? That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!	They don't care about life.
0	Erm... we are? Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million, currently a little over 380ppm, 150 years ago closer to 280. In 1970 about 330ppm.   Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia	i also remember at university there was a big deal about an aluminum plant in southern california or maybe mexico that was constantly blowing smoke into a particular mountain range that was growing trees.
0	so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it.	the argument is that a childs success is not by any means proportional to the sexual orientation of its parents.
1	oh yeah god is the root of all evil! tell that to the person who was about to murder their spouse for cheating but refrained from doing so because they believe that god is watching. how about that damn evil mother theresa too	actually god is, but money is in second place.
1	lmao seriously i rarely show emotion, but that's funny. 1. how does that compare to 9/11 exactly? 2. at least that guy was aprehended, where's osama again? oh yeah that's right, we were busy in a random country in the mid-east because some president's daddy was there and jr wanted to show how cool he was. bush should have stuck to bankrupting professional baseball teams and oil companies. and conservatives have no leg left to stand on... literally your pirate avatar is fitting as insulting as you would wish it were. take out your peg leg and try to stand on an issue. current republicans = bought and owned by private interest. those sad soles defending it = easily persuaded and uneducated. i know because i'm an elite liberal. i regularly laugh at how dumb you are.	http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33678801/ns/                                       us_news-crime_and_courts/  and i even supplied a msnbc link just to be sure you would say 'fox lies'
0	do away with scholarships, too. oh yes. humans have a natural desire to learn. are ever learning.  besides, you don't need two to three years to prepare for these exams, nor do you need a public high school to help you prepare for them. teachers must assess all the time in order to teach. the issue there is not grades, but assessment. the appropriate methods varying, for different teachers. you believe that, because you don't know anything else.	i agree that the gpa system can be misleading, but devoid of an alternative, we have to keep it.
0	Could you please cite where you are getting this biological definition of evolution?	Evolution is a change in the frequency in alleles in a population over time.
1	studies from 1955, 1961, 1964? i believe that a lot has happened since those years.	); hamlin, 1964, 113. for a summary of in utero fetal encephalography (measuring brainwaves) in the near- term fetus using abdominal and vaginal electrodes see bernstine et al., 1955. i think these are adequate.
0	Yes, the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards!!   If you hate your job that much, quit. You aren't being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something. If you don't like it, don't do it. If you hate trade, you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots.	Rich people do a lot more to oppress people and take away freedom than the government
0	This joke is based on some reality, "the conquest of the North Pole is traditionally credited to Anglo-American Navy engineer Robert Edwin Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909.   Anyhow, not all jokes are completely true, how many stand up comedians have you heard??? If you were to nit pick every joke out there (being politicaly correct etc) there would be no jokes left!	A good joke is at least based on some reality.
0	Oh joy another drive by with absolutely no proof or evidence.	Assuredly, a very high state of being constantly afraid.
0	No! At conception we are a person and human.All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.	A fingernail clipping is human.What you mean is; when do we become a person.
0	Well I'm glad its no problem for your son. No child deserves to be harrassed.	But that is not a problem with my son, me or his father - it is a problem for the pathetic hate-mongers who carried out the acts of harrassment.
1	i know! i should totally be sorry and ashamed for being such a horrible liar... i mean a dick sucking homosexual and a liar! oh i'm going to the seventh circle for sure... except one little tidbit easilyridden. i didn't lie!!!  embarrass? hun you forget who wears the tiara in this forum....	yeah - jason - you should be ashamed of yourself for being such an outright liar.
1	You really don't get it. The best thing about a free market is when someone acts like a fool they get burned. Thanks to government intervention and regulation when someone acts like a fool they get bailed out.   If you like we can have the trains run like Amtrak.	With all that evidence right in front of them, why do so many stupids call Obama a socialist?
0	This coming from the person that makes insane claims without providing evidence. Atleast provide some when asked!	A very typical tactic on your behalf and I would not expect more.
0	Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose.And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves?And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around...What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol...But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content.	I keep hearing gays say that but every time it's put to a vote, you lose.
1	so your saying he was 200% god-man? i'm not a mathematician but that can't be right surley.	I think you are forgetting the fact that He was 100% God and 100% man.
1	Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of "proofs" reveal themselves. What's next, Nostradamus?	How did they know that the "vapors" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?Jeremiah 10:13When He utters His voice,There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:“And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.He makes lightning for the rain,He brings the wind out of His treasuries.”  Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC—more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.Genesis 7:11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
0	So Lewontin is the person who determines the opinion of the general public or something?	Miller continues;His mistake here, is that evolution isn't any of those social moral things because it shouldn't be.
1	Who is Allah, Alex? Great, I'll take 'things a terrorist god would do' for $1600 Alex.	If God wanted to, He could raise up people from other countries to fly planes into buildings.

1	My article say's this. it needs to be noted the alleged evidence for extensive history assumes uniformitarian geology. Because of this fact, this response adds up to: Your theory doesn't work under my theory, so your theory is wrong. Of course you don't want to consider that fact, do you?	your own quoted article states that your source is wrong, and then goes on to say basically that since they don't like the accepted geological explanation, they won't pay it any mind.
1	Great job straight out of the leftard playbook. Can't refute the message so go after the messenger. Would it matter if it was printed in the NY Slimes, I doubt it.	"Baldwin says his research not only 'confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals,' but it found that 'the mainstream homosexual culture' even 'commonly promotes sex with children.'
1	perhaps you should smoke a lot less crack? funny isn't it how the people who say that invariably want a larger government? btw adam smith, aka 'miguel sanchez', is a prominent mexican free market economist and spiritual leader of the latino pride movement, with suspected ties to people smuggling and drug trafficking operations along the californian border. his magnum opus the wealth of mexicans details an insidious plot to bring down racial equality through free market principles, estabilishing a millenium of full spectrum mexican dominance of the american financial, legal and industrial systems. the only barrier to his evil plot? patriotic americans who understand the benefits of government control in all aspects of their lives. i'm surprised someone as educated on such a diverse array of issues as yourself hasn't come across him.	the point is cost-effective health care for all americans and the integrity of our national borders, and all that goes with it.
1	But in all reality an embryo is inside a uterus, living solely through a placenta and a two month old baby is not. That is a significant difference. One may argue how significant, but it is silly to say the only difference is time.	But in all reality.. a baby is no more different at 2 months old than an embryo...
0	Just like no one is really "for" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war.	Getting back to the original question...yes, i think it is very reasonable to be against abortion and for a war.
1	Yeah. It's snowing sooner here in the Midwest. I think the next Ice Age is coming.	Whether it is man made or natural or both factors work together; I think it is the beginning of serious changes in the atmosphere.
0	Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise.	Non-fossilized tissue can't survive more than a few years, let alone long enough for any other part of the bone to become fossilzed!
1	Try and comprehend this child, your siggy is your OPINION. It is evidence of nothing real or imagined. Only in your mind does it prove anything at all.	Furthermore, your constantly claims about your religious rightness fail due to the simple fact that your religion is not the only religion.
0	i'd say out of the 6 billion people on earth at least 4 billion of them are richer right now than they would be had the economic systems never changed since the era of globalization began. i don't think the number is as small as 3 people. how doesn't it lead to stability. think china and their reform to capitalism and westernization. are them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation? it will be stabilizing to have them westernize. however, it isn't necessarily good. yeah i can see what you mean. the people are just about ready to burst because the us and canada depend so much on each other. nor did i. whew, we agree on something :) isn't that the truth.	not at all, as it makes people want to revolt.
1	were you hiding under a rock until recently? phelps has been making the news for years for showing up at gay (and other) funerals. i think they even had a phelps-based character picketing funerals in one of those pc gay-rights themed movies like the laravie project didn't they?	well it seems that no one minded him showing up at gay funerals it was only when he started showing up at military funerals people started noticing.
1	Bush is a Luddite...Yadda, yadda, yadda..... Bush is the anti-Christ ...Yadda, yadda, yadda emoticonXRolleyes	He just believes that his is the word of God.
1	no... a debased intellect has things backwards, that would clearly be minds of your ilk buddy. so.. what then? your heart tells you to go jump off a cliff? on contrast that old you book you claim tells me to sit down and live a day, guess what i'm gonna do? go live a day... and avoid watching them have to scrape you off the ground. that old book is about reason, respect, love decency and standards that preserve life... a fallen heart cannot be trusted. i trust a heart governed by that book... rather than a mind with no self control living for the 'heart' - they give heart a bad name. sorry pal... i dont' expect you to understand it, and i am fine with that - it is your choice, but it hasn't been wrong ever, and never wronged anybody.	you would think open indulgence in any and every proclivity known to man qualifies as thinking for themselves.
1	how about when it dawns on you who he was when he came the first time? lol! trade in your blinders for some spiritual light!	when will you realize he isn't coming back for you!
1	Yup, I get the drift. You're the sort that is in denial about how he feels about gays; equating tolerance for gays with tolerance for murderers, while pretending you're doing something else. Now I know how you think, thanks!	There's no comparing gays to murderers in anything I wrote, Kronus.
1	Oh, but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant.	But sometimes she was in such pain that she resisted, and then she said she would be dragged down to a torture chamber in the basement.“Many of the brothels have these torture chambers,” she said.
0	I can see what you are saying. It's pretty much true...being a Jewish homosexual, I know it first hand. But just for once, couldn't they pick on somebody else?It seems almost like a bully tactic for the Christian heterosexuals who are against same sex marriages to pick on someone who doesn't have a legal leg to stand on...that's sad.	Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong.
1	ROFLMAO! Nice way of restating the 'inaccurate' statement basically the same way.	What the theory of evolution states is that monkeys and apes came from a common ancestor, and that humans are apes from a taxonomy point of view.
1	oh ok, so I assume you don't live in your own house? I was trying to picture over 61 people fitting into one house. :)	We have post-graduate and internation student halls, but most of the other post-grads are students anyway (or it might be because Scotland secretly considers me as a international student being from england)
1	Talk about incoherent wishful thinking. Instead of unsubstantiated claims and baseless attacks, why don't you provide, oh, I don't know, mybe some peer-reviewed EVIDENCE? You know, that little old thing that is required for anyone to take your wild claims even remotely seriously?	I realize you want to believe that evolution is fact but you yourself admit it's only a theory and a false and fraudulent one at that.
1	Oh, I see. So America does not care for the rights of the people? America cares only for the opinion of the majority? Hrm, that's funny.

Where in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or the Bill of Rights might I find such a notion?  'Rouge	here in america if the majority wants it, the majority gets it.
0	Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer.

0	the government has no business invading into the private, legal activities of two individuals. and how is requirement able to defeat straw purchasers? if you don't feel comfortable making the sale, don't make it. it's as simple as that.	i expect them to go to someone who can make sure the transaction isn't illegal one way or the other.
1	THe religious reigh is not mainstream either. And frankly, you are also confusing politics and religion. You do KNOW that there is a difference? You also know there is a differnece between hateful proclimations and scholarship, don't you??	The liberal left is not mainstream, Trebor.
0	If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food, why not spare pain and abort?	You have no idea whether the unborn will be 'unhappy', or even poor, for their lifetime.
0	that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran, mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni.  so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before(iraq) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat(aq) and unrelated nation.	well, latest word is that the alphabet soup is taking the threat seriously.
0	It doesn't make sense because no one makes that claim. There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution. That does not mean that evolution is random.	And the reason they say that -- one of them -- is that NS on the level of the population is random....which makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever.
1	So, a forty year old having sex with a twelve year old is ok then?	I suppose they are really asking for the minimum age of consentual age to be lowered/removed.
0	Did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.	You see all the straight people know that whatever ther gays get, they will want more..and you just proved it.
0	There are no objective reasons to condemn gays. Marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it.My advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions, believe me I have lost alot of support from conservatives for this, perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes.	And what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if I may ask?I'm assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably don't pertain to you well, cause your not gay....
1	if i were a virgin it wouldn't insult me that you called me such a meaningless terminology. ignoring that nonsensical 'insult', i shall simply call you a man-whore and move along. as for the answer to the question, i will ask you why you try so hard to contribute constructively to a website that rewards you with nothing. oh dear, man-whore, that 'virgin' just burst your ego, what will you ever do?	perhaps more the point is that you're too scared to ask yourself the question: 'why do i care so much about getting points for doing absolutely nothing on a site that gives me no reward?'
1	Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?	I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy.
0	Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago (a real cave, not one of the commercialized ones). Bats actually have better eyesite than humans, but even they can't see in pitch black. No eye can.	In my opinion, this guy is basically saying that if you had a bunch of bricks and mortar, a building could be built.
0	This is why the title is "God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle :)	So the definition that began this thread that God is identified as"the greatest being possible" must limit the possibilities to a finite number.As I write this I can see that it's self-evident - but what I can't see is howthis gets us any closer to showing that God exists (or not) !
0	They are safer. The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then.Let's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies. Only 13% of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them, Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30, and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack, with severe punishments for the seal being broken.	Recently liberals in Switzerland were successful in passing a mandate that militia members are no longer allowed to keep their service weapons and ammunition at home.They're no longer safe because of these pansies having their way.

Abortion is killing a defenseless, helpless, innocent baby in the womb....It is the most barbaric crime one human being can perpetrate on another
0	Lots of makers are still churning out lever action rifles. I am sad to see Winchester closed, but sad feelings is not a good financial reason to keep a poorly run company open.	The venerable Winchester line of guns is no more, despite a heroic two month effort to find a buyer.I have a hard time believing someone will not try to resurrect the name, but perhaps it's best to let it die away.

1	I typically don't read Antonia's propaganda pieces, so is she holding up the UK as a shining example of dental health? If so, I suggest that she ask a typical Brit to smile, so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion. The US' "bubbas" have better teeth than the average Brit. emoticonXRolleyes	So baby how about those poor folks in Britain pulling their own teeth because of lack of healthcare?
0	Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?	There will be fewer of them PER INSURED.

1	so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal?!?!? what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional? oh yeah, i forgot, the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want. so screw the will of the people, just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism.	that's in the last two years, not eight years ago, when the odious, unconstitutional prop.
0	'would the french accept people singing the la marseillaise in english as a sign of french patriotism? of course not,' there are so many flaws in this comparison it is unbelievable. firstly, there are virtually no french citizens for whom english is their first language. second, english isn't the national language of the us, nor is it a language that evolved there. a better comparison would be la marseillaise translated into bretagne, or translating 'oh canada' into french.	what i would like to know is when w, the 'decider', is going to learn english?

0	We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead	There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try :p
0	it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes.	this is unsurprising to most rational folk, but yet we still hear the pro-gun clarion call to have no new gun laws, etc.
0	Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that "incipient organ" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying "what good is half a wing." Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does "fully functional" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.	(6) Natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds, but actually tends to preserve the present kinds, since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no "survival" value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning.
1	oh yeah, it's a real brain teaser. who would have thought it's possible for someone to have two parents?	wow, you actually butchered this brain teaser stripping it of all of it's purpose.
0	But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.	you see, the thing is that not everybody agrees with some of the theories that usually accompany evolution (including Big Bang, abiogenesis, etc) that try to answer the question "how come existence".
1	Excuse me?! Didn't AIDS started because your homies either ate or did the nasty with monkeys, thereby crossing the species boundary? What did it have to do with "da man"? And crime and poverty in Africa is also the white devil's doing? emoticonXConfused	AIDS, crime and poverty only started with the influence of whites trying to establish their culture in africa
0	Actually, this data point is perfectly meaningless.NONE of the other information (or the conclusions) presented in this talk require "26".If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No.A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors.	“An application of the present results to the [Milky Way] Galaxy yields one supernova per 26 (± 10 estimated error) years in very good agreement with the evidence from historical supernovae.” G.

1	Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, "....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically." you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence.	If grammatically meant "with proper grammar", then there would be no need to say "grammatically correct".
1	uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!	sure keep guns ok..., we will..., thanks..., but..., we were planning on keeping them even if you disapproved.

0	so you argue that for some women, abortion is the 'easy way out', and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? could you please reiterate these reasons here (preferably in an enumerated list) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? indeed. but we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.  so i'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?	1. i think a lot of women take take the easy way out when it comes to and abortion for the reasons i have stated over and over again.......... 2. what i said was it seems you can't pick up the newspaper these days and not see a case of where some woman has abandoned a new born baby in a trash can or dumpster.......it never use to be that way..........

1	I find it funny you think Article V was repealed yet the bill of rights references Article V for passage.   So we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but Article V which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? You've really lost it haven't you.	If you can repeal the BOR, any one of them there is nothing to stop you from repealing the Articles either is there?
0	I think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well. I think that is where the majority of this problem lies.

0	The same ones you've been told about, what, a few dozen times now? :)A small exerpt:	And what fossil records can you show that one species of animal has evolved into another species of animal?
0	False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself.	Any random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system.
1	Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.	For instance; they have many pages dedicated to the history, derivation and definition of the word "species".
0	So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?	The topic of this thread is "15 myths about gun control" But you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual...
1	It's also hard to convince a rational person that something is so if there is zero evidence of its truth, but then you wouldn't have any clue about that.	People have been trying for centuries.
0	well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.	So, in other words, you an intelligent actor weed out the programs that don't look like anything that resembles a living thing.
1	That's the difference between liberals and conservatives (AKA "real Americans.) Conservatives have a sense of humor. Liberals don't.	Something about it doesn't scan well - I think it's because the 'voice' isn't developed enough to make it sound absurd.

The activity of driving is a priveldge granted by the state, not a right.Rights are not regulated by government. You have them and no earthly authority can take it away from you. The state never gave me my rights, I already had them, nor do I have to ask for permission to exercise them.	What objective standard are you using to determine what I do and do not have a right to do?
1	wow, these are some very nice values, lets teach them to everyone else! if the bible says so, why not? you seem determined to debate about a book of flawed values. are you sure you are defending this book of it's values? because surely you must have some kind of religious point of view to even think of protecting a piece of old literature.	not to mention the child slaves... i've explained one times too many times why it's a sensible thing to do in ancient times.

0	actually, the only valid question plotter asked is about the existence of dinosaurs (How did they fit into the creation schedule?) Good question plotter...Plotter: "when did he create all the other planets, when did he create all the other stars and comets?"Gen. 1:14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so. and XQ, what stories are you talking about?	Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize (lie) what God actually did, for God was done with everything then started again.
1	What facts? The article above your post is replete with documented facts. Are you in denial? Have you even read the article? Are all of your responses knee-jerk, shoot-from-the-hip defense mechanisms?Pay attention.	I see more whining on the Conservative side then the libral side.
0	Are those thousand people directly and immediately threatening to rape you, to kill you? Up close and personal? I will retain my right to self defense. I bet you would, too.	If killing were an act of justice I could take upon myself, I would probably kill about a thousand people already.

0	Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree. Correlation is not causation.	What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates.
0	So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning!	Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights.

0	So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence.	So what activates genes?When a gene product is needed, a signal from its environment, not an emergent property of the gene itself, activates experession of that gene.
0	i am familiar with both men; and my posts sound very lockean, which if you really knew locke you would know is true. remember previously in this thread (that is, when you were travelling these parts as 'bhbcu64') where i said that there is no right to control one's body? or where i said there is no right to suicide? that is locke 101.	matthew, though i doubt phyllis is aware of either man, her posts sound more like rousseau than locke.
0	Not entirely true. While we can't disprove that God created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. For example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old.	The reason for that is, that Creationism can never be proved or disproved.
0	gitmo is a media darling. nobody talks about abu ghraib. and it is still in operation see what the obama admin thinks about closing that one. not a fucking word. enjoy the grandstanding.	gitmo' i happen to think closing a camp that engaged in torture and the prolonged detainment of 'terrorists' without trial was one of his best choices so far.
0	?? What are you trying to say?Science is knowledge, all knowledge, that is, anything we find to be true. There is no other "truth" out there, if there were, we'd be omniscient.	This is their words as nothing science has "proven" overturns anything the Bible says.
0	Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.	Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly.

0	Why is saying that many things conflict with the well being of Society at large and bans them to the disappointment of those who endorse such activities. Consider rape, murder, incest and sodomy as good historical examples of such taboo activities, taken by you as an inditement of all gay people JSD ? You seem to take any moral stance or argument I make very personally, as if I'm accusing you of being those things. You work very hard to read into, demonize and condemn everything I say as if it is intended as a personal attack. You really need to work on that.	And you wonder why "bigot and homophobe" come up so much in response to your posts?
1	Some slightly earlier history shows that Clinton wasn't quite that worried about Bin Laden. In 1996, the CIA had Bin Laden pinpointed on a ranch in Afghanistan. It needed permission ONLY from the Clinton White House (not Congress) to vaporize it - it was in the middle of nowhere. An official from the "United Arab Emirates" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!	President Bill Clinton was very worried about Osama bin Laden well before 9/11 and HE GAVE EXPLICIT WARNINGS ABOUT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND TERRORISM TO GEORGE WALKER BUSH AND HIS PEOPLE DURING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIONS.

0	really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?	i think you've been reading too much george orwell, you've come up with new speak for science.

0	I wouldn't say most cjurches, because you cannot prove that. There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks.	Joe, this is no surprise....This Pope is a very conservative one and like it or not the Roman Catholic church and most churches believe the sexual act that gays commit a sin as they would any other sin.........The church believes love the sinner but hate the sin..........That will never change my friend
1	no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!	to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that?

1	And yet after investigating for over a year, our inspectors agree with me, not you. Hmmm.	Anyone with an iota of common sense knows that he had them, he used them and he hid them.The problem is that you are a complete XXXXX.
1	But what makes them any different from ant hills or beaver dams? skyscrapers are natural because humans are a part of nature and they built them.	There are many man-made substances that are not found in nature at all.
1	I don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one.	How many people would be capable of doing that to themselves?
1	Sorrowfully, you are so right. That's exactly why we have all "suffered" for 8 long years. Sheer. . . . .no I refuse to write it!! :)	I would bet if we required a satisfactory score on a politcal knowledge test to vote for our leaders, we would see an entirely new crop of politicians in Washington.
0	personally i can't stand it when someone uses 'lol'. it's usually used derisively when politeness suggests that leaving it out and responding politely is in order. personally i'm surprised at this thread. the author apparently didn't read the faq.	when you start substituting u for you and r for are you just look stupid, but everyone seems to understand and use lol frequently.
0	The human collective is the authority. One major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.	this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air
1	why would you think such an absurd concept. corporations don't cast a vote in an election do they? why not?  does a corporation have a mind of it's own that it may look to it's interests in it's attempts to influence legislation? no, it permits individuals to overcome finance laws and exercise greater influence than is normally permitted for an individual. should your car have rights? you pay a tax for it. how about your house? pay a tax for that also every year.	if that's the case, then we should alsdo eliminate corporate taxes and only have 'natural persons' pay taxes since corporations would be taxed without representation.
1	Ok, so you utterly missed the whole religion vs. faith part of the discussion, got it.	it takes faith to believe that a complex organ such as a pancreas or an eye could arise from randomness..
1	I see -- in your opinion is it is "illegitimate", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance.	It is a right that has been interpreted by Courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process.
0	The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)	the laws of logic are non-material, universal, unchanging, and absolute
1	Did I mention premarital or adulterous heterosexual sex?  I think not!  As usual 'big' boy is putting words in others posts!  Was better when I was on his ignore list..for about five minutesemoticonXConfused	so, premarital heterosexual sex is not a sin.
1	ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation.	good grief, to suggest that the god who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is, frankly, as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the bible that condones, allows, or supports any and every abortion that occurs.
1	Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.	Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it.
0	And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother.	It's much easier to sit and say, "don't have an abortion" than to stand up and say "here's how I will help you so you don't have to have an abortion".
0	I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child.I fully intend to have children in the future, including through adoption possibly. When I do I will love them with all my heart and put their needs above my own. I'm not going to do a half-assed job of parenting; I'll give it 100%.But not yet.Prototype:	If you can feel nothing remorseful from having your baby killed at all, then I pity the children you raise.
0	Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read.	In regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer.
1	i doubt you know enough about carl bogus speedy defense of bellesiles and his dependance on a flawed study by loftin which was also in turn defended by jack rakov who later apologized out of embarrasment? want to take a shot and drag this farther off topic and embarrass yourself and star gazer and any other adherents? you well know you are in the wrong ballpark as has been pointed out many times on this very board. keep clutching at straws you will never get enough to build that strawman. beating a dead horse is bad enough...all 9 justices agreed the right was individual in heller.	'[92] the result was a single sentence with a clarifying preamble: 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
1	There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value.	How pathetic they are not to appreciate that with all of the value and potential they see in themselves, that at one time they were exactly like these unborn children with the same mental existence they now claim is justification for their extermination.
1	How about he pulls it out from under the Ramadan tree and unwarps it rather than your Hitler Youth moment?	Sort of like him taking you to the DMV to get your driver's license.
0	There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out.	It means that as our medical technology has gotten progressively better, and a premature baby can survive outside the womb at earlier and earlier stages because of this, the point at which it is unethical and/or considered murder has gotten earlier.
1	i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin? if he is god, no one had to die for anything. he could blink his eyes and everything would be as he wanted!	god wants you to come to him, but on his terms, not yours.
0	Or that they tend to be better prepared, or even less willing to accept help from others or get breakdown cover. That's the trouble with these kind of stats, the interpretations are pretty open to debate.	Or just nicer people?
0	And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?	Or by not granting them to the child you are endangering the rights of the child carried by the woman.
1	i'm surprised to learn that you have the slightest idea about biology. also, your spelling and grammar is ever so much better in this post than your posts in another thread. how many of you are pretending to be a poster named vt?	a little lesson in biology told me that when the sperm meets the egg, it makes a zygote... that means that fertilization has occured... which means a life has begun (even the medical field and our government agree with this).
1	This, coming from an atheist. How consistently shallow of you. emoticonXRolleyes	Normal people can be spiritually fulfilled without any need for a co-dependent relationship with a "god".
1	I have. Yet I can`t seem to be able to do the creative math that will show that europe will become pre-dominatly muslim in any near future.	All one needs to do is to check the demographic data.
1	yes let's all cheer on the glorified shameless point-farming bitch of this site.	well this is nice to come back to- jc making serious debate.
0	Actually, my wife and I discuss evolution all the time. She's an evolutionary biologist. She did feel as if she had some duty to watch the show, just to stay on top of the sorts of things being said. She just has a low tolerance for willful stupidity. Which I totally understand. :)	LOL Kronus - my wife and I don't sit around the dinner table debating evolution either, she was shocked that people could be so intentionally ingnorant and zealous, supposedly in the name of Christianity.
0	No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se.	Just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world, doesn't mean that it is 100.00% certain, just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00% (say, 99.9999999%).
0	Well, it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material. That's rather impressive. Again, irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution, regardless of you trying to create that association. Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated, well that only shows one thing, namely that you are dishonest.	and some people were saying "They are just that close in showing how life could come from non-life."
0	Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?	This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce.
0	No it didn't, there's no suggestions for how to enforce background checks to stomp out straw purchases. Stop offering non-solutions.	Not if it were enforced and a suggestions for how the law could be better enforced are given in the report.
1	Anyone can "give consent". The issue is wether the parson is old enough to make that decission. I bet the children Michael Jackson raped gave their consent. Does that make it "allright"? Are the kids "mature enough" to take the consequences of those actions?	I'm not going to say "oh, well since the girl who got pregnant is still very young she should have an abortion", because if she gave her consent to having sex then she should be old enough and mature enough to having a child.
1	oh really? then please provide me with several links that prove i'm an idiot or shut the fuck up! considering you only have 30 points i'm not too sure just how much you could possible know about anyone on this site? come on dude! you're a troll and everyone knows it... stop your trolling, grow up and hang with the big dogs... if you can't then close your fucking troll account and go bye bye.	after looking at your posts, i'm not sure intelligence is gonna be your best argument... although, once the window came up i at least had the wherewithal to make sure my position was correct - ie - support = pencil and tag = pencil rather than say i support pencil in one and pen in the other...
1	oh yes those horrible wicked gays that will distroy families and consume morality as we know it.	everyone except those wicked, godless gays, naturally.
1	Anything that doesn't fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong?	So the article is of no use in drawing the aformentioned conclusion that homosexual couples are more monogamous than heterosexual ones, or vice-versa.
0	i think the the p. bagatti is the one that found the burial caves in 1873, not the bagatti who was working in the mid 40's. i have unable to get a copy of the original manuscript the leadership u describes. i think it is only in italian though. i am surprised that such a  'key discovery' from the 19th century is kept so quiet except by claims of an evangilical web site.	i suspect the author may have meant to say 'b.
0	Used against me? I never denied this. Surely you refer to this in terms of gay marriage. Considering I don't believe gay marriage is a right I don't see how my words do you any good.	What you say will be used against you.
1	she was never 'pro-gun' to you people. she was an anti. omg they reported on something. not exactly ready to help her reputation out before she was shot, though, were they? you have lots of bros that are lunatics. and one of them just shot and murdered 6 people, including a federal judge who was sitting on an immigration case and a congresswoman who opposed to arizona's immigration law. arizona: your land of cowgirl jan and cowboy sheriff joe.  i never heard of anyone who truly understood what a soul was, who thought they didn't need a mirror. i'm not surprised you think yourself at the level of god himself, able to judge who has a soul and who doesn't. it's the same psychology your bro with a gun just demonstrated.	what would we need with one when there's nothing wrong with our souls?
0	But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]	Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human.
0	Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said "minimal or negligable physical damage".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the "peg" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.	Are you sure about that?
0	The thing is the Dempski didn't provide any kind of testable or detectable definition about what information is either. He used vague but scienficially sounding terms to push his case. He knew it too.	Dempski uses information theory which uses log base 2 to support his claims about intelligent design.
1	Ah yes, your diversionary tactics. I am sure if I provided it, you would move the goal posts, or demand evidence that you know is not yet available.. So, since this thread is about Jesus, and if a 'historical' Jesus actually existed, where is your evidence besides religious articles, forgeries, and accounts taken from Christians?What?? No where to be found?? Gasp.	If you can't cough him up you'd better get a new mindset about what's going on in the universe.
1	Public policy? Takes waaaay too much thought. Now one can go to ballpark here and pay $8.50 for a half pound hot dog, smothered in thick layers of chili, cheese and grilled onions (2,200 calories, 55 grams of saturated fat, 1,600 milligrams of sodium). That's a no-brainer (literally).  Dono	the publics way too busy with important issues such gaining weight at fast food joints and spreading christian hypocrisy.
0	Then for you, you made the right decision at the time. I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child.	Yes, I certainly did consider these risks, and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion.
1	Because the gay personals are full of married straight men looking for discrete gay sex	What on earth makes you think that a gay men could succeed in seducing a straight man, and a lesbian could seduce a straight woman.Of course there always are exceptions.
1	I didn't think you had either the intellectual or logical ability to respond. :)	OK, take the quotation marks off the word insignificant and answer the question.
0	IF! But here's the thing, Mexico is making absolutely no attempt to truly stomp out the drug cartels, they're catering to them! Various political figures and police officers are on the take, they're getting massive amounts of bribe money from the cartels, stopping them would prove detrimental.	Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?
1	sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want.	just out of curiosity, please pick out your best one (just one, your best one) alleged contradiction from the gospels and let me see if it holds up to close scrutiny.
0	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will	So you do have free will to make your own choices, but God must "approve" those choices.
1	if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said.	so lets get this straight; you say it is fine to pick and choose which bits of the bible you accept, but it is not okay to try revisit passages in the light of other knowledge from outside the bible?
0	Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.	But for the sake of clarification can you tell me if you believe it possible that the rights of the being's inside the mother are being infringed upon?
1	Are you telling me liberals have jobs? You sure can't tell it by all the anti military/war protests, the flag burnings, you saw prior to the start of the war and by all the libs that post here 24/7........They are either unemployed or 12 year old kids out of school for summer vacation..........	Have you considered that there are some Liberals, who are retired from their jobs ?
0	would you cite the exact article for once in your life? i'm sick of seeing the main page day after day after day.	a full embassy is not expected, but it will be the first official u.s. prensence 1979. the announcement is scheduled for after the november election.
0	But the number of criminals that have firearms can be reduced. In developed nations that have very strict gun laws there are a lot less criminals obtaining and using guns to commit crimes. How does your theory explain that?	I've been saying this for years...Criminals have always had guns ban or notThat is the exact point of this thread... guns bans/control doesn't stop the criminals, endangering the populace.If you want to argue anti-gun... don't support the side of us "redneck-hillbilly-gunnuts" that you think are so stupid.
0	so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?	Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.
1	Not nearly as tired as the "YOU can't live like that because it is against MY religion" argument. Hell, that one pre-dates Christianity!	The tired old 'you can't eat seafood' argument attempting to try to justify illicit gay sex sin.

You all go right ahead and massage your shallow World views.	Certainly not from biblical accounts emoticonXDonno But I am not about to turn this thread into an platform for where you are trying to go.
1	so you want to try it as a demonstration? i thought not. claims are easy to make but you have produced no evidence but words and only fiction to present.  yep, it is almost there per 100,000. meanwhile, your nation is rising by leaps and bounds and innocent people are being convicted to protect criminals. even dan rather commented on u.k. crime being much worse than any place in america. there is a reason for that....	like i said that's why criminals would have more motivation to shoot an armed citizen.
0	Actually, I don't ask how the idea occurred. As I mentioned, Darwin suggested it. I'm not sure what the rese of that paragraph means.	2) Then u might ask, how did the idea of ape becoming human occured?
0	I think the FSM threw these guys a bone. They cherrypicked which taxa would give them the most statistically significant results. If they were to expand the method to include more and more taxa, they'd see the Noodly Appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Ramen.	“We thought that the idea itself was important, that this is a really powerful approach to a very major question,” said Funk, “but we thought there was no way in the world that we were actually going to get statistically significant results.” The reason for his doubt was the incompleteness and lack of uniformity of ecological data.
0	And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?	It destroys NATO's higher death rate "argument", and proves my point.California = "toughest gun laws" = 9.8 gun deaths per 100,000 population.Florida = lax gun laws = 11.1 gun deaths per 100,000 population.emoticonXRolleyes
1	So now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?   I expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? Am I to believe that you are a soldier there now?   Your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. I posted exactly what I meant to and you went off on a tangent. I asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if "show me yours before I show mine?" Pitiful.	If you had a rational thought on the subject, I would respond to this statement, but I won't even dignify your ramblings with a second thought.
0	Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.	No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns.
0	Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment, and how much gun control is legally allowed. Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.I see absolutely no comparison between the two.	In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with.

0	JFriday:In fairness, no one, pro or ant-gun can ever use UK stats to support thier argument again. Back in Jan '03 the UK government finally came clean and announced that they had been seriously fu**ing with crime statistics.You can make the argument that the UK state had something to hide with guncontrol and you would probably be right. Reliable information from UK ministries should now be accepted as less than credible.	You are really going to hurt for that statement.WHERE ARE YOUR STATS BACKING THAT UP?!?!?!
0	that's just darling, and all. but it still doesn't indicate that a fetus is a small person. no one denies it's alive. no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens. no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person, which is the simplistic point of that cloying article. it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate. i don't think it can ever be definitively determined.  using dr. seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument, however. i am not sure why you quoted shooter's post about a death sentence. however, if you really equate abortion with murder, are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder?	a person is a person no matter how small.
0	Really? The transcript shows that he did not ask her anything in the Gay marriage section of the discussion.Transcript can be found here: http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/pr...al-debate.htmland here: http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/...ipt/index.html (click on the same-sex benefits section and the transcript shows up right next to the video)	The difference that is being pointed out in the article you quoted is this: Biden DID clearly say he believed gay couples should have equal rights when it came to things like hospital visitation, insurance, etc.

0	Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.	(if anything it says life starts at birth with the first breath)

0	I believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions. So why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response?	Some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed.
0	So ban guns? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head. Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately. Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database. I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime.	In these transactions, the purchaser is not required to pass a background check so how can the seller be sure whether or not the buyer has a criminal history?
0	sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well.	humans are sexual beings, they have sex (something some posters may understand some day if he ever have sex) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precautions.
0	Making up numbers again georged? Care to post some links to this data?In 2005 Israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. As for the 28 billion in 2002...I know that is wrong. I recall a 200 million dollar thing, but I don't know if it went through.The rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so.	Pull those numbers from their primarily transactional GDP and problems would quickly appear cumulating with that spiral effect.
1	Only in the mind of a secular humanist atheist would it make sense. emoticonXGood	Wow, let's see what happens when we change a single word:Now there, doen't that make so much more sense?
0	And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the "genuineness" of ~2000 year old manuscripts...	Isn't it amazing how quickly creationists will accept natural selection and superfast evolution when it supports they're beliefs?
0	i agree. hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money, with the size of government, with foreign relations, with underage pages, with the military in general, with privacy, civil rights or even the most basic function of congress: oversight.  liberalism needs to be evicted from congress, therefore the republicans need to go.  it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans. democrats more conservative then republicans? well..given how far republicans have gone over i can't say i'm surprised.	the fact that america needs a republican congress is evidenced by the past records of the two major parties.
1	wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. finally you are cheering for the correct side. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again. it is funny how many of you religious people are so sure of your faith, but can't stand to see other people talk about how observable data doesn't fit with it.	personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again.
0	Except in the Dred Scott case the court wasn't trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right, or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery.	By your logic, when the Supreme Court ruled that African Americans were not citizens and that they were not entitled to protection by the Constitution in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) people should have just shut up and moved on.
0	I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated.	2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth.
1	is this the pro-sodomite woman talking here? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be?  where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. one more time now, preppy: where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. so go preach that trash to someone who's buying it.	i actually feel sorry for him and pity him he can not see jesus in another human being and is so addicted to the bible, and the teachings of the false god paul, that he and his kind have made it their god.
1	Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't "really" a christian.	Once again, my point was that evolutionists contradict each other.
1	well geeze pyg...i knew you were a bit itchy but i didn't know you hated gay people! i also didn't know you owned the 'internetz!' you must be related to al gore...how much did he soak you for his invention, lol? i don't know if you realized it but i'm gay too. yes indeedy little pyggy, shall i go back from whence i came or am i safe here with you? you seem to know what a 'rick roll' is so i'm impressed...'cause i've never heard the term.	god, i thought it was gay when youtube did it, but now obama... what's next, osama sends a rick roll to iran?
1	but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing. doesn't it. so you think that just because you enter a debate half-way, you can still give an uninformed opinion? weren't you the one ready to laugh at me? i won't laugh at you. i am only saddened by your personal attacks. yes, repeating yourself. i know what they say, you know what they say. i don't agree with them, on these points. answers in genesis are 'right' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being 'selective' in the information we use; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes. i disagree with them. do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution? i bet you've been very selective here too!	i see you still think my goal in life is to go back and read every post you ever made.
1	Just because you fail to realize what the article says doesn't make what you said true. Since you seem to like logical fallacies can you reconginze which one you just committed?	I really hate having to beat a dead horse more the once.
1	You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?	Did your thought process ever include the question: What choice does the "victim" have?
1	No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure.	Isn't that 'cells producing something other than what they are'?
1	And once again (s)he rambles on while responding to nothing said in the prior post. At least you're consistent in your irrational hate speech. BTW, the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all. Except in the mind of paranoid hate mongers, that is. emoticonXGood	Religion / christianity is negated by the very FACT it is violent and indeed "lunatic"!
1	oh yeah, that's right.... i forgot ;) i'm getting dementia already ;) well, i guess that if i don't make it to heaven (due to all the liberals i've tormented over the years) i'll be so busy shaking hands with all of my friends that i wont have time to worry ;)	if you believe in heaven, would you not think that the being who created heaven would have planned for the number of people who will be there?
1	So everything that other people say on a website or in a book is just and opinion? And everything you say is a fact? Nice how you've got things set up.	but indeed they are just other peoples opinions.Show me the documented proof!
1	And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?	Just when you are ready to come get my guns...... remember!
1	No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off.	Come to that... given that all humans start out as a single cell, that's definitely false.
1	Waxy, don't you have better things to do than cruise gay threads. ;)	Did you miss this part of my post?Waxy
1	Right on! The Obama administration is a colossal financial disaster. If he doesn't have another trillion dollars to XXXX he can't do anything. Tax and spend - that's all those liberal turkeys know how to do.	You're right, how silly of me to think that Democrats or this buffoon of a President would have anything to do with a BUDGET PLAN or even present a comprehensive budget; they have failed to do so now since 2008.Another illustration of the massive failure of leadership the Democrat Party and this President represent.
1	So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?  The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.  It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.	toxic gases, giant ash clouds, thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there's anything approaching an eruption, it's not a pretty picture.
1	Did you go to college, Trebor? You might want to look up how "pedophilia" is spelled. LOL!! Then you can go have a beer with Orion and watch his head swivel.	I can well believe Orion saying that you used a source that said the Rabbi's condoned pedaphilia, and denied the holocaust.
0	I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.

0	mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?	or have i got the wrong end of the stick and you think that we are discovering things closer to the truth and the stories are just a primative culture trying to work out how the world is as it is.
1	but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm...	i think if there is a god and it's anything like i picture, you'll be fine.
1	Wow, you are high on Christ...Scary...I haven't seen this addiction up close emoticonXRolleyes	For your info, and as I stated before, this world will not last much longer in its current state.
1	let's say that the law, based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data, decides that some folks are inferior to other folks, and thus less of a person? you know, if the law said 'because you are black, you are less of a person than shomeone who is white. you shouldn't be upset though, all scientific data suggests that you, because you are black, are truly inferior to those who are white.' would you think, because the law said so, that a black person was in fact a non-person?	the law can treat the late term fetus as a person because it has developed to the point where sentience is verifiable.
1	They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world.	I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature.
0	No it doesn't. That's why Darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory. Those who don't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand. Fittness is not a reference to big and strong. It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.I'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.You've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong.	Of those that are beneficial, the chance of actually being passed on is minimal considering the animal bearing that mutation has to actually be the biggest strongest animal to pass on its genes - unless it is lucky.
1	lol bias dysfunctions. i'm surprised you know such a long word. pity you don't know what it means. i can't blame you... being a retarded ignorant white woman. you don't even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs. go back to cleaning the house. worse is that you don't work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but don't pay taxes. you're better how?	pity you have not figured me out beyond your own bias dysfunctions , then you would hear the tone in my voice for what it is when i type it.
1	Oh, sorry, I didn't think that was a serious answer. Thanks.	How about a slap on the wrist and a suspended three day jail term?
1	And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....	Must simply be a matter of time...Honestly, Those arguments are totaly worthless.Compare the rate of criminality and murders in US and those of the average contries with gun-bans.
1	what? don't they have boyfriends? i'm just amazed that they don't design all women shirts so that they come off easy. hell, they invented the easy access bra ;)	who didn't know they needed certain shirts that come of easy...
1	oh yeah, you got me. bigotry and hate are major turn on for me. you could use a good lay anyway. muah. ;0	when i took a break from cd and came back you are so happy that you message me like 5 times begging for me to let you be my ally i still have them but i am not going to copy and paste them here because you will cry like you did with hellno.
1	yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!	no one knows anything about the constitution so how do they make claims that abortion is constitutional?
0	Apples and oranges. We're not demanding that they have abortions either.	Slave owners weren't demanding people own slave, simply that they had the option.
1	were it so simple. for the agents to 'freely assemble' among us they, or their superiors, must conclude that we are some sort of threat. would that make you feel loved? on a side note, i'm always surprised at how 'conservatives', normally so worried about government waste, take such a waste of taxpayer dollars so glibly. fbi investigating kiss-ins? joining subversive 'terrorist' xxxx biker groups?	if they're just hanging around amongst the minions, that's perfectly legal and not spying.
0	my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.	Here is an article on it:http://www.news-miner.com/Stories/0,...993580,00.htmlThe decisive moment seemed to be during the later arguments on the bill.
0	i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager.	the thoughtful atheist, full of skepticism but fearful of the possibility of the existence of god and a day of judgement, may wish to consider the prayer of the skeptic, as follows: o lord--if there is a lord, save my soul--if i have a soul.
1	i'm shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic.	a large amount of people disagree with you and you act 'shocked' at how that could be possible?
1	That is an interesting fact, how come I have never heard such a thing..maybe a link is in order and not a stormfront or the like link please....actually I have listened to gangsta rap...Easy E, Snoop, NWA, and so many others, in fact they are in my truck right now.. imagine a redhead "whitey" takes enjoyment in listening to all kinds of music.. hmm I also have Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Nat King Cole, and while we are at it I have music that I adore from Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Turkey and so many I cant list them all... whats your point?I would hardly call rap the decay of the 90's, apparently a lot of people listen if they are making money....I wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past? Maybe that would explain a lot.	What i really find disturbing is why you choose to ignore truths and facts....did you know that the blacks that were brought here from Africa were the criminal and the mentally deranged?
1	You mean the Conservative tilting Supremes donot know the law ? You want to tell them that ? emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken	How else can you explain some of the more recent controversial decisions.
1	with you it's pretty easy, we just assume it's all BS, works every time.	but it's hard to tell which he's trying to do when you can't tell the difference between brilliance and BS.
1	I'm actually in the Detroit Subs with one kid in a Blue Ribbon High School and two in college nearby. And yes, the mayor's got the bling goin on in his wife's city-leased Escalade.

0	Like most things theists that statement is based on ignorance.	Their health will deteriorate and probably will die in pain later on, so let's just rip of their limbs without them knowing!
1	From the Catholic Educators Resource Center...Yeah...I am sure there would be no myths in there...sure you're right. emoticonXRolleyes	But there are good histories, written in the last twenty years, that lay much of it out.
1	On the bright side, it appears that the Rapture will solve the Social Security financing problem...	Err, no correction necessary, I just felt like saying Enrapture.No the dooms-day will not be on the arrival of the asteroid, that has nothing to do with it, the dooms-day event will be a terrible event, even for the innocents, wrong on both accounts.
0	No, neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. Legality and morality are completely separate things.	Are you suggesting that legal makes moral?
0	Logically incorrect. One can as many red balls as one likes, and still only have one green one.	If it's all that endless and limitless, there would have to be an endless, limitless number of planets exactly like this one.
0	Yet it is the only source I've seen that counted the incedents in which a gun was used in self-defence, but nobody was injured. I could assume that all of your sources and Ians only count occasions where one was injured. According to the source, they'd 91.7% of all times where a gun was used in self-defence.	But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves.
0	But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins.	We need to teach kids how to think, and unfortunately, ID doesn't seem to deal with thinking.
1	Proof for a non-event? What century did your purported non-event supposedly occur, Einstein?	And yet you spiritually challenged turkeys still can't provide proof that there is no resurrected Krishna.
1	you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright. 'sickening' is a good way to put it.	yet organized religion forces it's followers to do just that, to not question authority, pooh-pooh science, and never think for themselves let alone following their hearts.
0	See above. A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence. Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked, rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in.	As said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place, so their effectiveness is highly questionable.
0	I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification.	No, it is you young padawan learner... that has been mislead, some of the most famous and noted Darwinian Naturalists such as Crick, Huxley, Lipson... and others have admitted to their own discredit that the entire theory of evolutions rests on chance, here... but here, lets burst that bubble for you a bit more:
1	No. What the doctor was doing was going to church. He was not a monster. He was not a "sicko." He was a murder victim.   What his murderer did was murder.	It wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.
1	Not the same thing at all! Most gay pride floats are moade of crate paper and glue guns. Not gold. I think you have stratched this one really far. Nice try, thanks for playing. Try again soon! Wow, nicotine cravings make me a mean person!	I'm sure all the money for decorations, supplies, and city services for gay pride parades down through the years would go a long ways toward it too--what's your point?
0	So have I, since I know that evolution has and does take place. But I catch it from both sides because I don't believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness.	I have actually been called a heathen because I believe in evolution.
1	never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming.	you totallly made up that there was some 'other speech' pushing a 'socialist agenda.'
0	Why do you oppose gay marriage? The traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride. The wedding is what is sacred. What you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well. You have no valid reason to oppose it either.	If someone is opposed to gay marriage and does not dislike gays or fear them, just not wanting to extend marriage to gays they would not be a homophobe.One can be opposed to gay marriage and not intensely dislike gays or fear them.
1	but do you ever question it for your self? or are you content to just show up .. and let someone else tell you what it all means. the rcc has made , by their own admission, mistakes in the past are you suggesting that it won't happen again? are you suggesting they never made a mistake in their interpitation of the bible? if so you might want to tell that to gallileo remember him ? he was burned at the stake for telling the rcc that the earth went around the sun!	the rcc has priests and i follow its teaching as set down by jesus christ through his first pope his disciple peter.............
0	Right. They can never show how the belief in their deity is not a textbook case of the special pleading fallacy. (Pretty funny after all the hubbub earlier about double standards...)	Let's see you show that the God that you believe in is that God.. and that this God even exists outside the imaginations of the mind?
1	So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?	If you have no interest, then why on earth are you even here to debate?Besides this, you're trying to put killing human beings on the same platform as animals or organic plant life.
1	oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?	however, i do not place confidence in scientists.
1	How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?	Monkeys don't generally have problems with their private parts being functional.
1	So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?	It's also a natural, orderly process that plays out possible variations on a theme, making the organism not inherently stupid and clueless, but more like a creative artist.
1	So you advocate religion not because it is the truth, but instead because it gives you comfort and security? The opiate of the masses eh?	How sad it would be for me if I believed that this is all there is.........When you die there is nothing else.........I truly believe that a lot of atheists find religion on their deathbed...........At least I hope that is the case............
0	I think you are entirely correct. From the page VOR linked:	I think it's nonsense interpretation developed by people who were afraid that if they fought for guns as valiantly as they did for free speech, they wouldn't receive any donations.
0	Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, "the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God," and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God?	It's a false dichotomy that some critics of religion have cast religion in by saying that submitting to spiritual authority and thinking/reasoning are going to be juxtaposed.
0	i just love how you call it a baby and not 'contents of the uterus' or 'product of conception' or 'fetus'. the truth is, that was a child.	steve, nobody was saying that you have to give 100% of yourself to your cause or otherwise you don't really believe in it.
0	I think you need to answer the same question I asked the other guy, who is God?	Or maybe it really was god that envolved from the apes.
1	Oh . . . please be gentle with me. Whew! :p	I'll be gentle with you and assume that you simply misinterpreted my statement.
0	Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under "evolution" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose "science" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea.	plus there are so many other sciences that are lumped with evolution,
1	Alexander, I don't give a rat's rectum about King James. emoticonXBanghead	I've lost track of what we're arguing about here.Are we arguing about Alexander or James I?Are we arguing about whether they were bisexual or homosexual, either one of those two or both of them, or which one?
1	Poor little poopie.   If your gay sex agenda wasn't of the devil himself you might be better received in the world.	Good way to prove exactly what I am talking about christianists and these dominionists in particular want to oppress gay people.
0	Your partner wouldn't happen to be a guy, would he? As for your Christian friend, ask her to join the fray. I'd like to ask her a few questions, such as:Who do you say Jesus Christ is? If not Lord, God, Savior, and Jewish Messiah then she is on the wrong page.Ask her if people need Jesus Christ for redemption for their sins?Ask her if people should repent of their sins and turn from them?Ask her who the Holy Spirit is? If not God, then she's on the wrong page (note Acts 5).Ask her if the Bible doesn't say gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.)? Those will do for starters.	She is a christian but she doen't share your beliefs.
0	ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out.	i don't think the mechanisms are in place in our justice system to have a trial for the dead, so we can only look at the evidence in the cases that people have privately pursued.
0	Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.	as i have told mathew s on numerous occasions, you are free to put forth an initative, in your state, to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages.
0	So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?	You could put it in the form of a resolution, in the debate challanges forum.
1	spoken like someone truly out of touch with reality. how long has it been since you were in high school? because if it hadn't been so long you'd know that short of coming to school in a banana suit (maybe not even then), kids could give two sh*ts about what other kids are wearing.	they eliminate the need for competition between the pupils to come to school with the most expensive ' cool' clothingthus reducing the strain on the parents' pockets.
1	maybe he'll unban himself on the third day (or was that three days and three nights...)	).Remember when Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross, and all kinds of people said things like, "He who saved others, come down off the cross and save yourself, so that we might believe" (that's a paraphrase).
0	now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is.	and lest you make a foolish claim, allow me to point out that the fact that you personally don't like how something is changing does not mean that's it's been harmed.
1	i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented.	only 15.1%... so that means that 276 men (51 senate/ 225 congress) will be needed just to pass a law that has to do with a women's body...and if its something that could be bad for a woman and/or unfairly good for a man then they can get no where near the amount of senators/representatives needed to supress it.... [66.6666-15.1 = 51.56666--(535/100)(51.56666)=276]  (http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/of...rs/cawpfs.html)
1	i love how you are pro-choice until its a choice you don't like. let people carry guns in their own home. let them carry it on their person. it has nothing to do with you does it not? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy.	nevermind my observation that left to your own devices, days go by where you either follow up your own posts or pat each other on the back as you regurtitate canned anti-gun control rhetoric.

1	And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am. However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice. Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment.	I didn't have to CHOOSE to be heterosexual.
0	I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling.

0	we do......most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time. For example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other "ancient" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand. Of course evolutionists will come back and claim "erosion" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called "Hidden Archeology" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the "wrong" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false.	If Literal Creationism is indeed true, why do we not find strata with species from all eras mixed together?

1	Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.	The book "Icons of Evolution" details the original experiment and the resultant controversy over the fraudulant findings.
0	how many animals do you think were on the Ark? how many species existed at the time?      the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23	Thought I'd start a new thread dedicated to this myth..
0	yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected.	after all, if what you claim is true, human beings have no choice but to 'devolve.'

0	i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught.	considering that there's little new information and reasoning in any of these debates, i find it surprising that they keep coming up.

0	Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.	how is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ?
0	No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance.	Meaning, I take it, pure chance, accident, or just plain 'luck'.
0	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.	then surely you can't explain away why enzyme a and co-enzyme b are separate compounds but work together to produce another by-product.

0	ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?	the independence of the church of england may have started with henry, but anglicanism is more correctly dated from elizabeth.

1	Oh, oh, and don't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment's text, which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions, in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state.

0	No, we shouldn't abolish every flawed system. However, when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death, it is not worth the risk.In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois, there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death. I think that constitutes a serious problem.	Does that mean that we should abolish every system?

0	Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!

0	Yeah, see this is the old "gateway drug" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a "gateway" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something "harder"? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.	AND THEN, you get to the marijuana addict that decides to try crack because all drug addicts hang together and so someone will try to get you to try new stuff.

0	there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic).	by saying he still had support i assumed you meant you thought it was somehow shifting to the democrats... my mistaken assumption.

0	Religious faith, by definition, is a "jump in the dark" and there is really little(if any) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and ScientificMaterialism can meet. In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there isnothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science. Butsomeone who has, so to speak, already jumped into the dark cannot see this.The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law, morality, social conventions,aesthetic sensibility and such like.

As you are, I am not terribly fond of policing someone's personal habits, but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries, assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored. This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem.	If drugs were more accessable we would likly have far less crime and far more drug adicts.

0	i love how you broke that down, but why would anyone who feels content in their life, by into something that's telling them they are wrong? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one.	in order to sell religion they convince people that they need it by telling them they are going to hell if they don't buy into their religion.
1	i'm surprised he didn't google it. maybe that's too logical?	he couldn't be expected to know that, since the american method of teaching geography is war, and they haven't invaded them yet.
0	it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about. do you mean 'having faith' in actual things? if so, then most definately. although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place, it can also be a fantastic one, and seeing that (as i'm an athiest) gives me some kind of 'faith' in the human capacity, society, etc (where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god).	i find that atheists often (not always) lack the ability to trust, making it difficult to have faith, even if it is just to have faith in the human capacity to redeem itself once is a while.
1	So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?	Are you suggesting that abortion is a judgment of God?
0	Yes, but all concepts of right or wrong are subjective.	Second, do you believe there is such a thing as right and wrong?

0	The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section.	One trespasses when he's not in his rightful place, but a baby developing in the womb belongs there.
0	All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past. If you wish others to take this seriously please produce some relevant evidence from a source that held to a higher level of credibility.

1	i must admit i was a bit confused when you came out with this: where in this discussion did i offer any solution to zimmerman (i don't remember mentioning him at all)? nor did i give any suggestion as to what i would do. so where did this 'both of you' come from? please could you also point out where i interjected pepper spray into the debate? a quote would be nice. oh, and the term 'enemy combatants' was just made up so that the bush and his partners in crime could get round international law. the geneva convention does cover them very clearly in the quote i gave.	troops are not issued pepper spray so it is a non issue which both you and jerry chose to interject into the debate.

0	daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation.	it is often 'taught' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally: indeed, a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed, and this requires a more direct and deliberate move: thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs.
1	Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?

Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.	so if that satisfies everyone's dues then this is done with.

1	You should use the same quote when whining about use of partial quotes, and not introduce different ones. Nozza made a false assertion and was refuted with his own words. You introduce a different false assertion and fail. Epically.	You should use the entire quote rather than cut to attempt to prove what you aare about.
0	Ever been to eastern KY? Many of the residents share a very strong faith in the christian religion.

0	Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?	I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.
0	Because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people.	And I repeat my earlier observation: if DOMA is such a travesty, why not go ahead and try to repeal it as a Senator.

1	well if I don't get an answer here I'll just spread it around the whole internet. Fine with me.	Well, answering you seems to be a waste of time.You ignore/reject any attempts at explaining the things you clearly do not understand, and youlater bring up the exact same things that you have had explained to you as if the subject was never broached before.You are incorrigible and uneducable.
1	i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?	if you really believe that gays are oppressed then believe me you ain't seen nothing in the world as yet.
1	Nonsense. Just look at all the great things that the Dark Ages did for Europe!	This isn't to say that ethics should be disregarded in science, far from it, but if the US raises a generation of kids who think science is satanic then the possibilities for development are going to be slim.

Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.	so stalin didn't actually practice communism (not that anyone has), but really just used bits and pieces to further his rule and such ideology is not communism but stalinism.

How would you like to be on the run or living in a hole for the rest of your natural days? That's the life that bin Laden lives today. He has to communicate to the outside world via courier and donkey. And tell me again, how bin Laden gains by killing Muslims? I don't quite get that part.	After all, the search has all but stopped for him and the US is being bled dry in a number of areas under Bush's leadership.
0	If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional, then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind.	Do you not understand what is currently going on?The ruling on whether the California state constitutional amendment was enacted "legally" was ruled on by the courts.What is discussed above is entirely separate.To say something brief to get you up to speed, our state constitution CANNOT violate the federal constitution.So if Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment, then Prop 8 loses.Whether or not Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment is the question that is currently being examined.

What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo.	I think the real problem is that you just enjoy being belligerent and doing things like calling people "weasel" and "dishonest" when you yourself misrepresent like you did above.
1	I knew the mangling of Jesus's teachings would be forthcoming, and entertaining. emoticonXHoho   And of course lying about what I've said is just par for the course.

And if someone were concerned about what constituted torture, I doubt he'd pretend it wasn't a valid question, as you're doing.How do you know exactly what Jesus would approve and condemn???
0	But you are forgetting life-without-parole (and I do mean WITHOUT parole). With life without parole, there is also no recidivism.	I suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti DP stance.
0	They're going to say no? CA tried that. Tell me the last time utility costs were reduced by a state agency. It's a rubber stamp and nothing else. We travel in different investment circles. I don't know anyone putting their money in US long-term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40-year useful life situation. What's your take on the US economy in 5, 10 and 20+ years? Good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached? Enviros or not, if the return is there money always has its own way of doing things. Corporations are awash in cash. Liquidity has been the name of the game for some time, but there are always bridge buyers.	For example, we haven't built a new refinery in almost 30 years although people are using more gasoline than ever; a group in Arizona has been trying since 1999 to get the necessary permits for another refinery, but they haven't yet been successful.

0	Not many women would say they had an abortion now, let alone back when it was illegal.It is an emotionally trying event. I can understand why she wouldn't for that reason alone. Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence, or it could be a combination of the two.	It's kind of funny that they claim this happened, but can't get the woman to come out and say it?
1	Oh relax for cripes sakes. This is the "fun debates" forum if you didn't notice.	Those ads likely pay a large portion of the bill to be here...I pay nothing...I doubt you do either...I ignore the ads...I doubt you cannot train yourself to do the same.
0	Of course everyone has some basis for their views. Not even denying that. However there are ways that using that "basis" most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example. There are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. All I am asking here is that Archie, you, JP, etc. own that.	'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.
0	But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.	I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.
0	you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't.	all the laws in the world won't work, criminals will always be able to get guns.
0	Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.	"That may be true, but it isn't harmful so I doubt it really should be on the list."

0	Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing.

0	Yes because it is "officially" a life.Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life.If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option.	We can't force a woman to give birth if she doesn't want the child, but we can force the father to pay for the child's care regardless of whether he wanted the child or not?

0	Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.	And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A.
0	I'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch, and my uterus is perfectly healthy, thankyouverymuch (not that it is any of your emoticonXCensored business), and yes, I do plan to have a child in the future, and don't really care what you think about it.	I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery.

0	You do realize that the rules are supposed to be absurd, to point up the absurdity of a recent court ruling, right?	ok.. lets get this straight..
0	third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking.	of what concern of yours is it that dono or anybody else for that matter was circumsized, circumsized their kids or believes in circumsism?
1	While I fully realize you can't do math and thus why you consider it atheism, but post #96 and post #81 are not the same post. But then again, you were the one who argued that post 113 came before 106 so maybe you do think that complete failure to understand math and linear thinking is sane?	He rants and rages against us while never making even the most basic degree of rational sense, yet to him it's us who is wrong.
0	Well, "reasonable" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?	And 'basically'.. banning firearms (as often proposed by many democRATS) is 'reasonable'?
0	when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore. 'fu** the poor' - mike moore. i put that together after a class in the mike moore school of movie editining 101.	did he change anybody's word to make it as if they said what they really didnt say?
0	well i was downplaying your argument because really, pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body. ITS NATURAL! OBESITY ISNT!	I am merely pointing that out.
0	i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site.	have to be careful not to over-complicate the page, but for once its sometimes difficult to tell whether a reply is in favor or opposition.
1	Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the "normal course of nature", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die. What about heart failure? Sorry, no paddles of life for you. We're going to let nature take its course. Just like your beloved pope, nature is not always right.	Cappy: How sad that you are unable to get this through your twisted brain.

And by the way, if one of your cronies "outed" me, then he was no buddy of mine. Evidently, he is intimidated, also. You should hear how they talk about you at TPA. LOL.	One of your old buddies told me your moniker in other forums, aaronsongs.
1	So the BBC folks are frauds and liars? You really are an idiot aren't you? Piltdown Bird is a colorful way of saying it was a Piltdown like fraud.   National Geographic knew it was a fake and published the article anyway.  Of course you probably still believe in the original Piltdown don't you?  You probably believe the Nebraska Man and Haeckels speechless apes were real too.  There is an echo when you think isn't there?	are you so stupid that you do not understand what the quotes around 'piltdown' signify?
0	The biblical end has got to be near. This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people's lives.	The suspect, identified as a 41-year-old doctor with personal and professional problems, is in custody in Fujian province.The victims were reported to be mostly first-graders.
0	I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.	I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule, but at close, honest examination would find that they rarely do.
1	No I think YOU are the imbecile. And it's great to see you follow your buddy EZ and his ways.. I suppose you've been training with him for some time now.. You're almost identical twins .. give it a bit more time and we won't be able to tell you apart.	Xcaliber thinks you are an imbecile because you believe in God.He must think you are a delusional imbecile because you think you have a one to one with him.At least thats something we agree on emoticonXGood
1	I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too.	How do you help an abused young girl stay safe by making sure the abuser doesn't get reported?
0	This is my understanding as well. Interestingly, concepts only approximate that which they intend to define. Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding.	We take reality and describe it in our minds and thus form it into abstract concepts which we can operate with.
1	tennis? you're joking right? it's already been proven that women can take on a man anytime in that game! others not so much but tennis most definately!	i say yes so that feminists and other women who think they're equal to men can see that they're actually not.
1	Oh but he is different in the mule's tiny mind. The Southern Baptist types are Christian and so uphold the mule's way of life, so it's alright for them to call for mass death.	He's no different from the Southern Baptist types who suggest nuking the middle east.
1	No, the law didn't specifically mention gays, or dwarfs, or one-eyed pirates, or 6 toed individuals. emoticonXRolleyes	The quote you mentioned in no way justifies allowing people to refuse to treat homosexuals while forcing them to treat all of those other protected groups.
0	Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding "cold")	But you will never come to agreement with everyone else in the world as to what makes something truly evil or good.

1	You forget, that all those nice rewards? None of them are rights.	Using your logic you may indicate that we should eliminate cars, food, heating/cooling systems, chairs, stairs, houses, apartments, work, money, paper, plastic, and basically everything that we have on earth because somewhere people are going to die because of almost everything.
1	First off, kudos on getting the quotes right! It's much appreciated.  Now, what's your actual assertion? If you spell it out than we can put this definition debate in context, and maybe actually get somewhere.	if all matter was information what would we need books or language for?
1	And yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children...	Another dimwitted white guy who lu-u-u-u-u-u-ves his guns.
1	Or possibly your Holy Fathe has resorted to XXXXX-bashing. It's all perspective. Frankly, I don't think that the views on this message board will fuel discrimination and hatred of Popes everywhere around the world, so I think they have less to answer for.	Well now my gay and liberal friends have resorted to Pope bashing........so very sad..........
1	How about other religious theories. What about teaching about the sun god? I don't mean that they believed that, but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe. Actually let's also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the Earth and other massive objects. We should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe.	Do you support the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public schools?Yes because it is the flipside to science and everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe.
0	a drink. a drink. one or two. and what the hell does abstinence have to do with this? everything in moderation, yeah yeah. all that fun stuff. i get it. i wasn't talking about light drinking. i guess i should clarify but i thought you'd catch what i meant.	you realize that weed being illegal is more harmful than good... and i dare you to get into a debate about that because i have so many facts in favor of ending prohibition it will make your head spin
1	and your kids go to private school yes? so you want higher teen pregnancy, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases?  if you are disagreeing with my statement that you want all of those lower, then you are admitting you either want them to increase or stay the same. as you have railed against abortion, it would appear you're being contradictory. make up your mind. and yet they have lower rates. funny how that works.  no. in the seven years since introduction 620,000 or so european women have used it. so that's around 88,000 abortions a year. 1.2 million happen in the us annually. as the population of europe is around the same as the us, it's not a valid point. 88k to 1.2 million is nothing.  plan b isn't abortion. try me.	do you have any children?
0	your argument is contradicting how can seeing people naked ifnringe on your personal thought and the other not? also the right isn't to marry whomever neterosexuals want. the limits apply to everyoen equally just people have different preferences.	if you could effectively prove that two homosexuals marrying each other would harm me physically or mentally, (and thus taking away my rights as a citizen), i would say you have a point.
0	That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb.	And in response to Zachvac i mean guns not arms (as in nukes) but im fine with automatics and such in the right hands.
1	So what do ya Say! Come On. Be reasonable! Do it for the children! Or don't we care about these children because they weren't hurt or killed by a firearm?	Downward trends, also being reported by other sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.CDC reports a significant decline in accidental firearms-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1994 and 2005.
1	Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.	It seems King Blue is the stereotype that pro-choice folks think of when they see a pro-life person.
0	Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?	Plus what did all of the insectivores eat for 40 days?
0	Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman.	Don't they get that the whole pro-choice movement is based in a desire to make sure that ever child is a wanted child?
1	Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it	A women by the name of Mary Anne Warren said this
1	i love when random myth followers talk about critical thinking :d	i see critical thinking isn't something you're particularly familiar with.
0	You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.	it dosnt simply say "see bible"everybody should have equal rights.
1	Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.	While things like this seem like small pro-life victories, they are really considerable and should encourage us pro-lifers that we are making a difference--getting back to a higher value of the unborn is our goal, and we must not let up.
1	Yes, but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper. Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that!	emoticonXFrazzled So .... you actually think the collapse of the Minnesota bridge is because of gay marriage???
1	So it's just fine if someone says "gay people are prone to force Christians out of their towns", eh? Interesting. emoticonXWowJust "typical English usage", after all ....	Some statements are obviously meant to demonstrate a common thread regarding a group action, but not to claim the ENTIRE group commits that action.
0	That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue.	Again, these are facts that the pro-life/Christian-Con movement you never find out about.
0	i love how hamas apologists require showing idf abuses to defend their actions. pathetic.	why don't you tell us about the terrorist activity that necessitated military activity that inevitably caused also civilian deaths.
0	You know that what you call "immoralism" is my life. Why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due? You don't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you. I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry.	Personally, I think U.S. conservatives have gotten too complacent these days--we need to protest like this more often.
1	Ah yes, adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others, to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy.	A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.
1	Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea! A lot of their mythology isn't original: it was stolen from other people who thought it up first.	Listen not to the lies of the Foodstuff demons, instead bow down to the Invisible Flying Space Monkeys, for they are the only path into heaven!
1	Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes   I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away.	If I haven't made you understand already, imagine a well-known media personality saying what I've just said to you, right out loud, to all the world, but off-the cuff and for no reason.
0	Well, that's your claim, anyway. Truth is that billions of theists accept evolutionary theory as is and reject the standard ID arguments.	All too often those opposed to Intelligent Design simply reject any notion of God no matter how unemotional and rationality based that notion is.
0	oh really?  science does not say 'we dont know x, y, z, but we want to know x, y, z, and so we observe x, y, z, and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true, or not? (it's a question..) if scientists were too busy learning what is, then the science that is present now, would be non existent, because in order for science to learn and understand, it must be too busy learning and understanding what 'might be', or what it has not known, yet.	scientists are too busy with learning more about what is, than what might be.
0	a lot of people are adopted... my science teacher was adopted. he had a successful military career that ended with him as a war planner helping to plan the gulf war... he had a successful chiropratic practice too. what you said is not so true. should he have been denied his life because of some emotional trama he might bave later in life? i don't think so.	some more innocent people will not be killed.
1	poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.	maybe you can look it up on the net.
0	hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill	i can name my own; germanic, and celt, slavic, and dinaric(italian-greek) are others as well.
0	Actually there is a better solution.   Mandatory male and female birth control pills, financial penalties if you stop taking. Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.	...to curtail abortions.Any woman who has an abortion for convenience only (not raped, no incest, no danger to the mother's life) shall have both ovaries removed.What do y'all think?
0	It is in the first place unclear to whom the "further harm" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different.	The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child.
0	oh yes i forgot to answer the key question: where does information come from. its a simple answer. from a local decrease in the degree of disorder. ie a reversal of local entropy. see adami for a development in mathematical and biological terms.	i don't care what the definition is...i can't even get you kooks to answer if information exists or not, even by your own defintion.
0	here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway.	like stem cell research, same-sex marriage and speaking in tongues?
0	The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary.	The dino would be to heavy to glide or fly with them if they weren't fully developed, and even then only a few yards could be gained when jumping off a hill, ect, and when not fully ready.
1	reckon if a rock could think it would have a concept or two.	you can say we are more conplex than a rock, but that does not make a difference; matter can not accout for concepts.
1	every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make.	well those 'slave owning white guys' (of which not all of them had slaves and most of them knew slavery needed to be ended) founded your country and established the government by which you feel protects your 'right to abortion' or 'personal autonomy'...eventhough they never established this....
1	Dude, you only figured that out now? I'm disappointed in you. just joking. Everything he states has a hidden agenda.	What was it they said about statistics?
1	wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights? well no duh but if i 'bucko' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i'm slightly different i'm not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality. and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay, accepted it and realized that other people aren't the end all and be all, that they'd eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn't the world maybe they'd still be alive.	if you can't answer, maybe you should deal with that.
1	In other words you would wait until we were attacked again before doing what is required. If we vacillate and wait for the nuclear cloud it will be too late. It amazes me; utterly amazes me, at how strongly felt the left believes in the good will of bin Laden and the terrorists to clean up their act. Just amazing. But with Bush? Noooooooo. He's ALWAYS wrong and never right. Isn't that about it?	I'd rather be correct and doing the right thing to make the world safer.

0	There are in place control procedures for traveling with weapons. All he should be charged with, and I expect he will before this is tried in court is breaking the Airport procedures, or maybe they are FAA procedures which could imply Federal laws.   This guy should have contacted the Airport at check in to report each and every weapon he was traveling with. They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed. I must say that I'm somewhat alarmed at some of what is allowed if I put my terrorist thinking cap on.

0	why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people.	sure, they've probably a hell of a lot of stories and anecdotes which would prove entertaining, but they're ... they're filmmakers, of all things!

0	emoticonXWowYou are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along.Asking "what they would need" is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place.A lot of "doesn't this look like ...", but that's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests. You see what you want to.	I think most scientists would admit the universe looks designed, so what would convince them that it actually is?
0	It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.	And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.

1	According to Genesis? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence? How about Darwin's On the Origin of the Species?	Anyone who looks at this situation logically should realize that at sometime in the past there must have been a time when there was less genetic damage in the genome.
0	I did not say that violent crime "rarely" occurs, merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks. I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals.	Because being the victim of a violent crime happens enough times for it to be a genuine concern.

0	i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management.	you are indeed correct that uncontralable forest fires are hazardous for humans who live nearby (as well as property).

0	Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore.	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of.
1	Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....	So we're not in the mood to discuss future restrictions that won't be used either.

0	allright, well then i think it's odd too, arians would have made more sense. i'm surprised they are considered obscure, the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church, and the arian controvery was it's main event. for the record, they were discussed in my high school, that's why i was making sure.	there would be absolutely no reason at all to discuss a relatively unknown and ancient religious cult in a junior high level history book.
1	You're out of your depth here kid. Go and clean your push-bike before you go out on your paper round....it's a disgrace!	But then he's been taking it in the shorts every time he posts his nonsense.
1	HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is.   6) And the standard "theistic evolution" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it.	Evolution and the rest of "big science" are just described as having an atheistic preference.
0	Having human DNA does not necessarily make one a human being. Transgenic animals can have human DNA, does that make them human beings.	By the term human I simply mean it is a member of the human species.
1	i am surprised that you were able to give a non troll answer.	well all of the trolls would be getting removed, so i wouldn't have a reason to be annoying.
1	Oh look, Gansao the blowhard is still living in his world of ignorance and denial... like his daddy Ezridden.   You couldn't educate a rock ya stupid bastard.emoticonXBye	Idiocy is persistently claiming it.That makes you and ignorant idiot.Glad to educate youemoticonXGood
0	Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case.	If there's not, we investigate certainly and prosecute if the law allows.
0	i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea. (from the science point of view)all humans are traced to monkeys from africa. from there they spread throughout the world. if it is not evolution, then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs? how come africans have a darker skin tone? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair? i doubt it is coinsidental, and no offense, but i dont think that a god did this for us. every person has a subconscience. in this subconscience we think of lesser facts. does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better? i believe so.	i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of.
0	do they conver the same types of subject? i have, as yet, not heard much 'good' about american education (nor health), so it's interesting to hear about these things from the horse's mouth (so to speak).	most midwest colleges take act scores and most eastern schools want sat scores, so most kids i know take both.
1	It's not often you see such a golden opportunity handed to you on a silver platter.	You don't see me getting on here and saying "and you call yourself an atheist?"
1	ah yes....."Gaytheist," the terminal homosexual atheist liar at various forums such as IIDB and Tweb misrepresents me to some guy who studies tadpoles. The little XXXX liar atheist claimed to the author that I used his paper as "evidence" of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she couldn't back up when I pressed her on it. This was merely his response to her strawman lie. Funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is.	Have I missed something in your list of delusions?A little something from your time at TWEB
0	It's possible that Archaeopteryx is not a direct descendant of modern birds but it's certainly not far from the line and it shares both avian and therepodian characteristics.	Where are the fosils showing it evolving from a bird or reptile?
1	i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused.	if you have one, i would love to hear it.
0	I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. Until then I'll remain skeptical. Let's remember that Democrats and liberals hunt. Remove that group and what's left? Something less than 20% of Americans that own only handguns.	No I'm not suprised I wish I could put my hands on the pol on firearms ownership that put the % of dems that owned guns was around 46%.
1	And because this man said it, it must be true? A simple appeal to authority.	Robert Naeye, a writer for Astronomy magazine and an evolutionist, wrote that life on earth is the result of “a long sequence of improbable events [that] transpired in just the right way to bring forth our existence, as if we had won a million-dollar lottery a million times in a row.”
0	I think bringing "emotions" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to "non-belief" would be irrelevant (and irrational).	when such is the case, it is no different from a religion
1	We have a terrorist supporter among us, objecting to restrictions on terrorists! Why do you hate America?	Terrorist agents, who have access to missile launchers, grenades, grenade launchers, heavy machine guns, and anti-aircraft cannons, all of which come from all other nations in the world...are going through the hassle of coming to America, procuring forged documentation, and buying civilian legal firearms that no army in the world has ever adopted as their main battle weapons?Did you eat lead paint as a kid?
1	the 'city' huh? same one same all. we know who to sue for attempting to infringe on a fundamental right now don't we. who hired the investigators besides the mayor? nice try sparky. oooooh, kroll has deep pockets too. l00k at the board of directors and the usual suspects. misapplication of funds too huh?	nyc private investigators find us online sellers offer guns despite background check warning - the washington post  the investigators were not police officers.
0	i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it.	this creed strains credulity to the utmost, and i suspect you'll find lots of christians who don't accept it literally.
1	Well are there 4 or are there none? What about the Archaeopteryx lineage, why do you keep avoiding the question by changing the subject? It's no wonder scientists get annoyed with creationists.	All you can show me are 4 "links".
1	So theistic evolution is not a belief, not a faith at all? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using God to fill gaps?	Conclusion from data and reason, not belief.
1	Worship me and I'll bless you too. With money of course. He can't even give you money. I am the true god and I created the mindset that he was a god in him. Worship me and spread the word about the true religion. Everyone who joins my church will instantly get $1,000 and after a week of membership you will get $1 million. The end of the week is when my project is and then you can go into the real world. All those who didn't believe in me will be destroyed when my world I created gets to the dump.	Worship not money, and I will bless you.
1	He was in Indonesia dear. Read his XXXX (my marks)  I thought he was as old as the devil??	the vietnam war ended in 1975. but president obama was born in 1961 and he was 14 in 1975.
1	You should watch where you cast stones, kido. Your original post is an example of a straw man...not mine. You should be more careful before operating a gun...you just yourself in the foot. LOL!	Everyone together now..."STRAW MAN"
1	You have no Idea how glad I was that I was sitting down when I read this!!  First it shocks me that you haven't labeled all those who claim to see UFO's liberals.  Then I have to wonder didn't at one time the RCC say we were the center of the universe,... The sun went around the earth,... the earth was flat ?? Theres no one but us .. It was all created for us??  Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something. I think I'm going to be sick!! Back in a few.	mm i am usually with you on every issue but we part company on this one......there have just been to many credible people who have had sightings.......maybe they are light years ahead of us in the technology of space travel...............can you imagine what they could teach us if they made contact?
0	and you believe that to be what? you really need to just say who/what you think the creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.	for the sake of discussion let's say it is the same one all the signers of the declaration of independence agreed it was.
1	They're not Jews, and not rabbis, just like you, who are not in your right mind, and who is an authority on nothing but rubbish.	Apparently you've never heard of Messianic rabbis who don't buy into basic Judaism.
1	So much bandwidth; so little substance.   Aren't you embarrassed to post such inconsistent ramblings?   Women with pre-existing mental problems are more likely to experience post-abortion issues. Well, DUH!!!	if i didn't know you, i'd swear this was an (almost as idiotic) pro-lifer post concerning the incapability of women to make their own decisions.
0	And you've been failing miserably, partly because your definition of "atheism" is asinine. Even most Christians would disagree with you.	I enjoy written debates very much, and I'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the U.S. government ...
0	And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay.	Even though I love them because they are my family, I would not support them if they were to marry.
1	Hmmm, was that an ad hominem attack? You know, what you accuse others of doing? Hypocrite.	Now how could I have forgotten about your lame XXX.
1	I thought the almighty expressed his will in the Bible for mortal men to know it...	Let's see if we have this correct.You are a mortal man and yet you dare speak as though you know the will of the Almighty.What was that again abut the sins of pride and arrogance?
1	I know I know. Unless a woman is gestating or dieing she is being selfish.	And, Jitobear, this is exactly what I was saying when I spouted the abortion statistics in the US.
1	Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not? Well, alledgedly, 23 innocent people have been put to death, and for sure two unrefutable cases. I don't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system.	what I am talking about is not a death penalty trial as we have today, but after the person has received a 100 year or more sentence.
1	the moon is made of cheese because i said so. was i persuasive? neither were you. do you have the capability to actually debate with facts? you saying something is true doesn't make it so. oh, and i'll save you the trouble.. i'm going to burn in hell, i'm, how does it go? spiritually challenged? and oh yeah, i'm going to bring about something called rapture or something like that. lol	you're right in step with satan, though, so you can really feel proud of that.
1	Thank You. You know how much I love to impress people.	We're all quite impressed with your knowledge of third grade insults, unfortunately, this is not debate.
0	Life evolved over billions of years rather than being created in a few days.	Tell me ONE scientific fact that contradicts the Bible ?
0	Prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative Christian rather than a conservative Republican OP. Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together.	My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations.
1	EZ. That is not what I said.I would think a Bible website would be good for biblical information, but for archaeological information? not so much.If you want to provide archaeological evidence of the Exodus, why don't you seek out information from an archaeology sources? Please answer this.If I wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings, I wouldn't seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource, I would seek an archaeology expert. Doesn't that make sense?	Shame on you for that bigotry.
1	How uninteresting must that be for you to intentionally spend time annoying people on the internet?	Oh, I have a life...I'm working on my second music cd and a spoken word effort....in my personal studio.
0	in what passages does jesus refer to his junior partner? i'm not saying he did not, rather, i'm not recalling off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus.	the holy spirit is referred to repeatedly by jesus in the gospels, and the working of the spirit is a central theme in acts and paul's letters.
1	that i later 'concede' in a pm? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession.... what do you think a 'logical premise' is? show me denying that i said a. i'll be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. of course there is an objective truth here, i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable....	or maybe you just needed to redesign logic to go along with the redesigned universe you came up with when you first arrived?
0	simone darling, please stop. your making yourself look foolish. your trying to compare uniformed soldiers in an organized military under civilian gov't control to terrorists. there is no comparison to be made here, even you should be able to see that. huh? the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia.	the way he conducted himself, bush probably wanted to get totally out of afghanistan too.
0	how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!	i believe dametel is referring to leviticus 20:13 - 'if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.
1	i am impressed you are impressed by that backward-minded bigot who's main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said, 'fuck the fags'? come on dude.	yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.
0	yeah, that was all just exaggeration and absurdities from religionist to make the story more fantastic and supernatural. or else nobody will ever join them religion.	i just don't believe that a certain jesus came to this planet, born by a virgin, walked on water, died on a cross so people can enter heaven.
0	It is an acronym for 'Y'oung 'E'arth 'C'reationist. In other words... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God.	Am i stupid or something... whats a YEC?
0	And she was having unprotected sex? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility? Yeah, I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers.	Supposing she drank heavily before she knew she was pregnant.
0	The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow. Please give me one way those two things relate to each other.	THEY care about life more than the "free" world....I believe that one of the reasons we are dealing with terrorism in the world is because we are committing mass murder on babies in the womb...Need i say more...
1	'poor bill' ? yes poor poor bill, i really feel sorry for him for having the misfortune to meet monica . anybody who had the bad luck to meet monica deserves our compassion and pity. yes.... poor poor bill....so hillary was a saint and lord knows what monica was !	thats precisely the problem: saints are good for one thing only, hence monica.
1	Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?	Mayabe they were wise, but they didnt have all the knowledge on the topic of power or they would still be in controll today.
1	in that case its a single act of terroism so if you know all of this what's the name of his group? i wasn't on a high horse. also could you post the source saying he was part of some group and not just a loon.  jeez that sucks. *shrugs* well no different from black leaders who were targeted, slave owners/abolitionists who were targeted. this happens all the time. i'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. i love how its a conspiracy! *roll eyes* its terrorism not a conspiracy. unless you gonna tell me the governments in on it. xd	he did, and we do know why he did it.
1	What the heck did you have for breakfast today, huh? A bowl of nails and terpentine to wash it down? Talk about a foul mood. You've been to half a dozen threads just this morning launching personal attacks at everybody you come across, and most of them have something to do with 'I'm glad there aren't more people in the world like you,' or 'I hope you're the only ones the terrorists kill so we can get back to making this nation great,' blah blah blah. They invented things like Midol for moods like yours.Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them stupid, or misguided, or immoral, or dishonest, or any of the other snipes you've been firing off. Lol, and you're telling me to not throw any hissy fits.	Thank god there are not more people like you in the world/.
0	What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. MayThere is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations. I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3 One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:	These authors claim that for an entity to be regarded as a person, it must have developed at least incipiently exercisable cognitive capacities or abilities..... (Another view} distinguishes between a living human body and a living human person.
0	For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad. If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together.	But, what if, everything in the universe was originally "placed" pretty much where we see it now?
1	i lived next door to a dope dealer who was a murderer, am i dead ? no !	i find it offensive, not out of being a pedophile, but by being american, taught to respect other peoples rights.......and here we are 40 years after martin luther king.........still violating peoples rights successfully.
0	Dealt with. Wolves and dogs share a genus, not a species. Along with coyotes and jackels. See above for lots of transitionals, also.	I'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species.
0	now lets add one more wrench into the anti-gun works! when the american people read, 90% of weapons come from the u.s. they are led to think, bought in an american gun store.  something even sinjin apparently believes as well. however, doing some research, i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u.s. weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store. why? because they came from the u.s. government, dea and the cia. military grade weapons. now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u.s. weapons?    central america: the farc, the contras and the flow of weapons  america! get the picture now?	although it must be noted that some percentage of the weapons that were not traceable could well have come from north of the border as well.
1	You evidentally didn't grasp the apparently immense complexity and vagueness of my post.	Are you for or against a ban on smoking in public places?
0	i'm pretty sure you're joking... but still, if one has the power to acquire and manipulate knowledge sufficiently well, then one can learn to protect himself from bombs and such. my house was recently afflicted by ants. massive amounts of ants. yet their numbers did not amount to much after the strategic placement of a few of these.	the first time he eats a pizza with something good on it, has a beer or a little bit of grab-ass with a woman not wearing a beekeeper suit, muslims will commit to blowing up and/or beheading him, and by sheer number alone, they will succeed.
1	so atop a mountain of ignorance is where we will find religious people? yeah, sounds about right to me.	he has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.'
0	Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.	Heading further down that path...If the "right" belongs to the child, then the "right" obviously also DOES NOT belong to those opposed to gays.More specifically, the "right" to WAIVE potential parents as ineligible does not belong to those who are opposed to gays.The "right" would belong to the child to decide who HE/SHE wants, and it would be a bigger usurpment of this right of the child to DENY the child the option of gay parents than it is to present him with the option.
1	So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot.	Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.
0	Since they are issued by the military I would think so.	Are those weapons registered?
0	Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one.	if something happens to the people who are named on the website as a direct result of the website then i would say a great deal of justice is due and the burden of guilt is on the one who runs the website.
0	the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.	over the last generation or so, the dutch became quite good at rescuing hostages from the hijacked trains that became an annual event; the russians lost a number of hostages in a theater a few years ago when the gas they used proved a bit strong; and the filipinos became notorious for losing all hostages.
0	If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is "true"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator. References:* The Creationist Basis for Modern Science.* The Lie: Evolution ~ Ken Ham.* Evolution: Fact or Fiction? ~ John Blanchard.	You can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason.
0	if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep.	so really what was your point cause you haven't made one!!!
1	Ha. Those must be the same folks who believe in the missing link like you do.	I am surprised (well not really) that you don't see the simularity.And, we must not forget the Elvis believers too
0	i love how it is 7 to 1.................. this is just the best.	star trek has no depth in character, and it's all ab out the cash.
1	would you like some cheese with that whine? emoticonxrolleyes btw this only shows over 60+ years of liberal government incompetence.	i think that it demonstrates that the liberal biased media got it dead wrong.
1	Umm, don't know about you but I also eject waste through my penis - just don't do it when having sex, just not polite (unless they ask, now there's another fetish I don't get). Isn't it odd if the anus was not designed for a penis its still pleasurable?	In fact it is dangerous to shove things up there, such as a penis, especially when the body is trying to send waste out; this courses all manner of problems associated with digestion.
0	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.	In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'?
0	But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.	In that case, even if you want to put religion into the mix.
0	The guy can have an opinion but the ultimate choice is up to the woman who can listen to what the guy says or not, it's up to her. I believe that is what sinjin was saying.	I have known girls who have gotten pregnant and wanted an abortion but the fathers of the babies told them they didn't want them to have an abortion so the didn't and now the baby is healthy.
1	not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage. 'ex-gays' are supposedly straight, right? so they are already protected under existing legislation. if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans, and then insisted they should be known as 'ex-democrats', would we need another legal status for them? no.	i don't keep track of who is who, but whoever is pushing for hate crime laws that establish gays as a protected group with special legal rights.
0	Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word "proof" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story.	So I should not accept what you say without some degree of doubt.
1	That explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? ROTFLMAO	Nice work; I think that the reason those kids who own guns are more likely to get into trouble is a result of a specific political outlook that they are raised under which has an ifluence on their thinking.
0	I believe it's there, but I'm certainly no one to push that belief on anyone.	And all I was saying is that, despite Zechariah, I have yet to find anything supernatural in myself.
1	Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march.	think of it this way...you have 1 camera at the event...you hear about this 't-shirt' thing and all of a sudden the camera is not focusing on the kid tripping over himself to roll the egg but to gay parents wearing these t-shirts and them talking about how they are great parents.
0	Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.	It is a direct accusation by the CURATOR OF BIRDS for the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION against all the proponents of the dino bird story.
1	Are you blind? I was refering to Nancy Pelosi's "'fair' speech" policies, not free speech. Fair speech is an attempt to limit free speech.	Utter nonsense!It sounds like a bunch of bozos still haven't figured out what free speech is all about.
0	race is the elephant in the room of american politics. segregation is not official, but who can deny that de facto segregation does not exist in the usa? blacks stick to blacks and whites to whites. do you see any blacks in the tea party meetings? how many blacks voted for jon mccain in the last presidential elections?	did you know that jefferson was an advocate of racial segregation?
0	Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of "creation science" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion.	If there are many people reading this that already believe in evolution, or for that matter, believe in biblical creationism, then it is important to keep in mind that the people appealing to science have biases at work, regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves.
1	Hey, it's the same god, just older. The birth of his son mellowed him out, you know,.. made him think about the future more, and have to worry about responsibility and all that stuff.	Why does it keep referring back to the OT without mentioning that the god that is around today is a different one?
0	Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of "creation science" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science.	Wow a statement that is both honest and correct from a creationist!
1	I am not making a mockery of the second ammendment (and so what if I am. Isn't free speech on the first ammendment?). I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this. If I was mocking anything it was that you were dodging the question because you want to say no limits although in face of something so obvious you are embarrassed at such a statement.	You know the answer.
1	Fundies don't say do as I say, not as I do. We say do as God says, not as I do. There's a huge difference.	These are the ones who preach "do as I say, not as I do."
1	In the future, please try to spare me the theatrical flair.   ....	I am not sure how one would even calculate such a thing, unless you had ever private who enlisted in the military run by the local wally world and fill out an application.

1	You don't mean Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, do you? The Russian spies? Nah, you said wrongfully accused.....	Or someone who was wrongfully accused doesn't get a chance to get out.
1	The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust.	You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.
1	as i said, for clarification, and no other reason. it's all drivel to me anyway, so i didn't see the problem in adding evolution onto theory. show where it said that if you would, and clarify your question. if you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life. i'm surprised you couldn't deduce that by just reading what it said. why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article? can't you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it?	some other questions i would like answered about your 'proof' would be: why is it assumed that the nuclear reaction taking place in the sun's core would be perfectly linear?
0	Really? Let me see. Two creation myths and a global flood myth where 5 million "kinds" of animal were crammed into a big box that magically floats for a year - yeah, that's secular history.	The claims made in the Bible can all be see in secular history.
0	I do appreciate your point while I disagree on principle. I guess it boils down to the fact that even if I believed in a God I couldn't accept that He would command us to suppress our true innate nature. Why would He makes us that way and then expect such a thing? Christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what God commands. To suppress a good many natural inclinations. To accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished, our nature brought to heel.	Of course I agree with you about sexuality, but that is a different issue.

0	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i think that it can because money has fixed all of my problems.  come on! give me an answer to what can't money fix? leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. i would feel however i was feeling before i died. in the debates hypothetical i wouldn't even know that i was going to die. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that? wow! there are many things? to back up your assertion, list 5 of these things for me.	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant.
0	and the other two...? 'political disorder and confusion' is not the same as personal 'disorder and confusion'.	as has been pointed out to you now more than once, the most that can be ascertained from the evidence is that it was possibly done in some places--perhaps in remote areas or areas that were not entirely in lockstep with rome (or constantinople early on).
1	WOW are we seeing the softer, gentiler Jyoshu?   Your snoopy avatar must be afecting you :) :p	Gay people are right when they say that things like divorce are a lot more prevalent of a problem; I think churches need to cool it some on the homosexuality thing and simply work on showing the love of Christ.
0	I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.	If they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare, and not just legal.
0	What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.	#3 - Can anyone explain to me why no other apes, monkeys or chimps have evolved into a higher species?

0	one idea per episode? there were always at least 4; one for each main character. and they always linked together perfectly. with the exception of a few episodes at the beginning and the last one, seinfeld was always gold.  the simpsons, on the other hand, has sucked for the last few years when they turned to the 'pick a celebrity guestspot' system.	the show 'seinfeld' was absolutely hilarious.
0	you're assuming a need to reduce it because government, or a special interest, requests it. if enough people want it reduced, their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it. deemed by whom? the government, or a special interest? who cares about the species? the majority of individuals, or the government, or a special interest? if the majority doesn't consider them problems, then no solutions are necessary.	ok, no one said that i would look to a large govt for anything.
1	Leave it to a leftist to cite a leftist forum for evidence that a leftist agenda is supported by dedicated leftists. Go figure, huh? This post just proves that attempting to reason with such an irrational thinker is truly a waste of time and effort.	You and your other handles that comprise this entire forum of one man who probably also needs to see a doctor for a strong psychiatric prescription.
0	Clinton gave access to b/c which is known to prevent pregnancies. Bush has reduced access to b/c (including e/c). A primary reason for aborting is money - Americans have been less well off under Bush.	Of course, we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time.
0	Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.	Are you telling me that arctic foxes at some point in history did not have this ability?

0	And for the record, i think anyone that tries to take away a women's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life, or has any concious about the woman at stake here. You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. I am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do.	Any other subjects on which you are delusional?probably....I think anyone who kills an unborn child with a knife to the head is a murderer.
0	HA wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints, muscels, heart, and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb? Obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet. Some of which can be detrimental.I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out.And im not really sure what a "pregnancy" is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant, i think of 2 people, not just 1.Also, the baby has its own blood, its own immune system, and contains its own calories once consumed. theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion. Just like you need food everyday.	Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental.

1	Don't forget cheaper to feed, take orders better, and are harder to hit.	First off, just because some Iraq's are crazy and use their children as weapons, does not mean all Iraqi's are such.
0	Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it.	He's a creationist for crying out loud.Their manta is "to lie, steal, cheat, and defraud anyone" to get their message across.
0	Brinks plays on people's fears to sell security systems that don't even work. Insurance companies play on people's fears to sell their policies.	The glorification of firearms in movies and video games is wrong and promotes irresponsible gun usage, but the gun industry's advertising propaganda, which exploits people's fear of criminals to sell guns, is perfectly responsible.
0	He was barred for presenting hard evidence against the Big Bang. Observable evidence. He was the head astronomer at Mt Carmel not just another astronomer. He was our best one.Being barred from the telescopes he was in charge of , being fired , and having to move to Germany is not what you consider suppression? I am not willing to discuss this with you anymore if you refuse to do it honestly. You can say anything.	Halton Arp is far from suppressed.Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.
0	well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?	when someone says 'there is no convincing evidence for x', you have to look at what biases they may have about x which might cause them to set their requirements for 'convincing' to be higher - or lower!
1	And you know what I think? I think that everyone who doesn't have sex 24 hours a day 7 days a week is denying human beings life every second. I'm sure some of those sperm would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you don't think they should live [/sarcasm]. Why don't you think this? Why embryos? Embryos are the one thing that have great potential to cause harm in a woman, and you just so happen to choose them as human beings. Very suspicious...	i would say that those people are glad to be alive and im sure some of those aborted babies would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you dont think they should live..

0	Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing.	For the most animals, the indicator for life is brain activity (Note: brain activity is one of the requirements of life, but it's not THE definition).
1	woohoohoo, diogenes, talk about twisting my statements, wow! wow! i am just plain flabbergasted!	it seems to me, in light of the number of recent child rape/murder cases committed by recidivists, that simone has it backwards and those folks who have no faith in our justice system would rather see ten innocents die rather than punish one guilty person.
1	You your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that? I suspect that you are talking out of your elbow since I haven't seen any evidence that you know what logic is. Mostly I see hysteria and superstition in your posts.	Your logic is remarkably lame to say the least.
1	lol, i love how everyone seems to feel the need to out-wit rk even after over 50 days xd	you probably can't figure it out becuase your brain is not following a logical thought pattern.
1	Tell that to a 17 year old kid!! Haven't you ever been a 17 yera old horny ****** befor?Wait I forgot who I was talking to,.. more than likely not.	People should be responsible for their actions be they man or woman.......Why does the innocent unborn baby in the womb after to pay for the mistakes of its parents?
0	ya know what? this has inspired me to make a thread, hold on a sec.	i don't think personal attacks are the route to take, but i may be too nice :p i would emphasize that while the fetus does have importance as a potential member of our society, when the woman becomes pregnant we have to deal with what it is.

1	wow, i am surprised you didn't say 'kill the retards.'	capital punishment is hypocritical no matter what the state of the accused is determined.
1	irrelevant. what about the common people that weren't blessed with god's son? revenge: definition, synonyms from answers.com tr.v., -venged, -venging, -venges. 1. to inflict punishment in return for (injury or insult). 2. to seek or take vengeance for (oneself or another person); avenge. n. 1. the act of taking vengeance for injuries or wrongs; retaliation. 2. something done in vengeance; a retaliatory measure. 3. a desire for revenge; spite or vindictiveness. 4. an opportunity to retaliate, as by a return sports match after a defeat. tell me, simone, how exactly does using force to defend oneself qualify as revenge? revenge is tracking down the person that wronged you and cutting their throat when they're at their most vulnerable. revenge isn't killing your attacker because you're in fear of your own life.	taking revenge on the wicked is god's perogative.
0	ummm... the death penalty has always been around. i never claimed that death was the penalty for every crime, nor that it was the most common punishment. try to catch up	There is written law going 2500+ years back and death penalty was not the most common punishment used.
1	Yes I apologize for your ignorance and your inability to 'get it'....	Thank you for your apology.
1	Is there some kind of prize for most consecutive straw-man arguments. I ask this because you seem to be going for a record. No where have I claimed that I would fix your problems, many though there are.	Thank goodness we have you to fix our "problems" for us.
1	i so love it when you have to work so hard to avoid any points i made. i take it as assent to my original post.	probably because you know you have a snowball's chance in hell of getting one.
0	True. Gallup couches the questions in a way that favors spiritualism. That is his preference and I think that his polls are slanted that way. I don't think I have ever seen a poll that actually asked the question directly and "no religion" doesn't really ask it. The numbers are just guesses. I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low.	The trouble with those poles is that peopel who 'have no religion' can be theists, and there are atheists that assocatite themselves to religions for social reasons.
1	You don't want anyone saying gay people are whacked, but you will make it your business to insult someones religion?! You are a hypocrite!! You say,"Don't judge gays!" But you are judging people by their religon?! I thought you were more mature then that. Hey you live ad learn.emoticonXRolleyes	Its like they knew that once these kids hit college they would a) get too horny, b) find reasons to question their faith.
0	darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class.	i have seen these debates and granted mine are not the best debates and may just be plain and simple retarded but my answers match the question.
0	Says who? People have the right to say anything they want to. There is NO right to not be judged by someone. It doesn't matter if something someone else does affects you and me or not. People can think whatever they want about other people. People can also SAY what they want. As far as a personal philosophy of behavior, I agree with you--what you're saying is a good rule to live by. But I can't agree people have no right to condemn or judge others.	In fact I have no right to suggest they even try if it doesn't impact me directly and negatively.
0	1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. i haven't watched tv in quite a few years, and when i did i didn't watch c span.  where are the facts that the court has cited? 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself. wouldn't i have to be in denial in the first place though?	2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself.
0	Oh it's no mistake Montalban. I, unlike you, am quite clear in my arguments, and have a direction and a goal. We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you "allow" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it!	You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about, and argue against that.If you want a (non-exhaustive list) seehttp://www.crystalinks.com/creation.htmlYou have simply picked one model, treated it as the only one, and constructed a (thus false) argument against it.
1	You know I actually considered that. Too much work, though. I have added to my list of things to do when I retire. That is, of course, assuming that we turned things around by then. If not, I will likely be too busy "holding the fort" against the hordes of starving yuppies.	Looks to me like its time to set things straight by writing your own book and name it " The Kansas Conspiracy Farce" by Daewoo :)
1	I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?	It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
1	Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be. These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone.	There is no possible way they could "accidentally" be so off the end result.
0	And are people in DC legally allowed to carry their guns with them in a concealed manner, having them readily available like the rest of us do in the country?Absolutely not.

0	That just sounds alarmist to me. Do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights? It is just not going to happen.	I'm not saying being a lefty is bad, it's just that it seems some would throw away a right just to "feel" safe.
0	i'm going to presume that you are a christian. why are you a christian? because you happened to have been brought up in a christian family. why aren't you a hindu? because you weren't born in india. if you were born in india, you'd be a hindu. if you were born in central africa, you'd be believing in strange mountain gods.  use your brain, however reassuring and pleasant it is, god does not exist.  oh yeah, and why won't god heal amputees?	if you know a little bit, isn't it possible that in what you don't know, there is god?
1	dude, check my results. i'm shocked. i answered honestly. wow. you were def right, i aint no liberal. o.o	well... i guess no one can call you a rino.
1	Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.	Wow I think I may have won Hank's debate and the only proof you need is at dictionary.com
1	Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime? Or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander?	What price activist judges?
0	Logical truths do not come from "somewhere", your question makes as much sense as "What time is a moose?".You do not appear to have read my post at all, variously repeating what I have said and addressing things I did not say.	where do concepts come from when all that exist is matter, we know concepts are outside and are not dependent on matter or experence, or being discovered (if we did not discover them they would still exist)how can matter bring about something that is not matter
1	as to the first part, i answered you above. regarding the second part; what in the world are you talking about? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs? and boys born of virgin mothers? can you post any evidence of these cases? beside jesus of course, because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit.	and just to push your opinion a little further, if the soul enters the new being at fertilization, then does this mean that those girls (though very rare) who are born just from an unfertilized egg have no souls.
0	Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing.       Why didn't YOU cite them?	That is just a story of one person.

1	the liberal propoganda army is on the way? the man  must be lonesome!	i guess we are all still waiting in anticipation for the liberal calvary to arrive....
0	But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption.	If the "big bang" created matter than were did the stuff needed to make the "big bang" come from?
0	There is never a question of "killing people" in such circumstances, it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die, i.e. where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery.	Often, this debate becomes dotted with examples of things like human vegetables who might come out of their coma as potential people who aren't really people, or a person who was knocked out in a brawl as a potential person who is not (on some level) currently a person, and many other examples.
0	jito, i forgot to thank you for agreeing with me on eugenics. what is that?...the second or third time we have ever agreed? well, you have only 8,966 more things to agree on with me to show you have converted to proper thinking! emoticonxangel  consent is relevant when it is relevant. do you deny that women engaging in sexual intercourse (outside of rape or some other type of coercion) give consent to engage in an act that may result in pregnancy? i never said that sex was only for procreation and i don't believe it is. i do believe, however, that the procreative potential of sex must be respected. i do believe that when a being comes about as the result of a sexual act then that being should be respected.	and of course here you go wanting to meddle in the lives of others by telling all of us we only get to engage in sex for procreation.
0	Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.	then your argument too is flawed by the same principals of debate.
0	no, i completely agree. it's frustrating from a woman's point of view also. does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere, it's solely the woman's responsibility to take care of the child? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting.	i completely believe that fathers can be just as good parents as mothers, even better in some cases.
0	do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them? also you failed to address my point. is self-defense not a legitimate use for guns?	you can take them home, have them stolen and then used to commit a crime; or your son can take them to school and shoot a few dozens kids.
1	the nice part. i'm surprised that you've even read the bible. presumably you're commenting on 1 thessalonians 5:2, wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that.	:)  i am ready for judgment day..........as you know the bible says that death comes like a thief in the night.......well maybe your bible does not say that...sorry........
1	So if you were attacked by a 250 pound man who is an 8th Degree Blackbelt, you'd prefer a fair fight?	Also, a person has a change to run from those other things, admiittedly, a tossed rock can do damage, and if your opponent is especially hefty, a frying pan might fly a goodly distance, but it's the pure cowardly aspect of whipping out a gun that angers me, having a considerable advantage at a considerable distance.
1	Clue: It's there in your own sentence. Five letters, beginning and ending with "S". If you need further interpretive assistance, don't bother with Sarge, she's waiting for an original thought.	Perhaps you can demonstrate the link between swiss gun laws and a shooting in a swiss owned factory in missouri with an interpretive dance.
1	You can take a horse to water. I provided evidence to support my assertion. You provided ............ "Oh no it isn't!"	That's the front of the knee, what's that got to do with this argument.I've read the link, and just because it came out of Harvard doesn't mean that it's official or that it's of any measure of validity.
1	But religion is not a topic for science classes. Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative.	On the other side, you have the evolutionaist crowd, who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue.
1	you don't know? oh yeah... you're supposedly married to that teenager, prodigee.	who is dana and what does he have to do with whether these two countries are alike?
0	Well firstly we do not know that "volition" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.	My second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems, because a computer cannot model volition, the defining characteristic of life.
1	Therefore you accept that the Republican party almost as a whole is "grade A USDA approved Liberalism." About time you did.	First off, That's grade A USDA approved Liberalism in a nutshell.
0	Excuse me, but you didn't fully read what he wrote. He didn't say that he supported abortion. He said that he wasn't as much a freak about it as you're being.	You're automatically excommunicated if you support abortion and only can come back into the church via confession.

0	The same could be said of Clinton.Tell me. How do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations?If a person like Sanford isn't exposed to his own medicine, how will he (or others) not recognize how it tastes?Furthermore, I find your perspective a little baffling.What he said "many years ago"? Is that something he should be embarrassed of, because he was wrong?Or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught?Cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard. It's a good standard.We have too many politicians who look out for their own interests, and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously.	es' past (from many years ago in fact) in their faces when they mess up.
1	i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.	if you are looking for me to say that 'abortion is ok in some circumstances', i can't do that unequivocally.
1	We all agree that abortion is "killing". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open "mind". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead.	The shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life.
0	First of all, when gun owners say ban guns, it means, if you want to ban ANY Gun, you are a gun banner! You guys want to muck up the argument with we don't want to ban all guns, just some guns! However, that statement is just for now! If you get the ban more will be following!   Nelson T. 'Pete' Shields -- Founder of Handgun Control, Inc.	I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources
1	You know you have outwitted a conservative thinker when they completely dodge the argument you have made.	But if you can't even see that then there is no reason to even attempt to discuss it with you.
0	I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting.	BTW - I don't think hell is a place, either.
1	this particular one, formulated the way it is, might well fail. that's why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is.  where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from 'controversial' issues? ooooo... that's a persuasive legal argument. i'm impressed (not). gay people have been 'earning it' for over 100 years. in the short-term, we may suffer setbacks, in the long-term, there's no stopping us. another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue. no matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, republican-appointed judges. of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom.	if the lawsuit makes it to the scotus, it will go down in flames.
1	and you shouldn't forget the thousands of gays incinerated at this death camp!!!	Did you forget that?In a similar way, sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.
1	you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions. woopdee fucking doo. but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. well done darling. but being an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of years with not the rest of their lives. now let's get back to the facts - where in an arranged marriage does it say the 2 people getting arranged don't have a choice?	but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with.
0	Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.	You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence, I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods.'
0	How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child. And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law. So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that, there is no question.	But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women.The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it's often taken to establish that abortion is murder, and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly.
0	oh yes this is all over the news in ireland. irish farmers are having a canary that its the end of ireland's sugar industry. and cereal too because of crop rotation. nobody seems to have even thought of the question as to why exactly the eu should pay for an unsustainable industry as oppossed to farmers moving into something profitable. edit: oh and its tied into something about sugar being one of irelands few natural resources. emoticonxbanghead	hopefully we can get out of this pointless business of propping up our inefficient and pointless agricultural sector before this century is over.
1	is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james.	want the list of military actions he engaged in as president?
1	That was someone else you were posting to about them "hammering" porn, whatever that means.Gay men watch hetero porn and thats the reason for so much gayness? Real logical.	nd so strongly, at least this proves that I'm right about the porn hammering.
0	wow that's an excellent bit of knowledge. i didn't know that about the ps updates, i only had 1 and 2 and i felt like the hassle of continually buying a new one was not worth the free internet. also, as for the red ring of death on xbox, i guess i wasn't an extreme enough gamer to let mine over heat.	you have some major titles that xbox doesn't have like infamous, ratchet and clank series, uncharted, god of war, the last of us, sly 1,2,3,and 4, jack and daxter collection, killzone, heavy rain, resistance, and others that i can't name off the top of my head.
0	Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups.	The KKK use of firearms isn't a legal and lawful use, as dictated in the Heller ruling.Next argument please!
0	And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.	The point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro-gun side is very doubtful.
0	They have. Prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction, almost 360 degrees around. Predator animals have their both eyes facing forward.	)It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies.
0	Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example.	Why would a book be right about the lives and events recorded in it and wrong about origin.
0	We are on due process now? How can you evolve how you deal with due process? Due process simply means that processes which are required by law. The court evolved this into substantive due process which is changing the meaning of the constitution. Do you deny substantive due process?	Look, what I said was that the courts have evolved how they deal with due process.
0	That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed.	However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.
0	I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.	Why should they kill a human being in the womb, whether this human being is Arab or not?
0	You mean to tell me it's a falsehood??   I don't believe it.	from here  from here  there are more.

1	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.	Then it's okay to lump all Christians together!Evidently, that makes it all better!So much for being a free-thinker.But then again, you never addressed the issue I asked you about slavery.You claimed to be moral, based on democratic ideals of moarlity... but democracy would have very likely continued slavery in the USA!It was Christians who aimed higher.
1	So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage.	Here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry, supposedly in "defense" of "traditional marriage," when some of them are out sneaking around, cheating on their wives, and lying about it when confronted.
0	It's a lot more than what you've come up with. What evidence do you have that indicates the Iraq population wasn't heavily armed? As for the Taliban, you're confusing Afghanistan with Iraq.	Come back when you have something of substance.
0	Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves.	The facts speak for themselves, and no amount of geneticist/darwinist hand-waving is going to change what they say.
1	I guess we just haven't shaken all of our Imperialist ways. After all, we've only been away from the British Empire for a little over 200 years.:p	I thought the US government mostly engaged in killing young black men (or rather middle aged black men once the appeals process is over), not old people.
0	There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored. Those that haven't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about. There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred.

A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens.

0	You don't even take into consideration the possibility that Japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the US- if guns were freely available in that country.

0	however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many.	how do you know for sure if the emotion you choose is correct?

0	up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms.	morality, in the strictest sense of the word, deals with that which is innately regarded as right or wrong.
0	Oh, probably about as many as there are killed by bayonet lugs, pistol grips, heat shields, detachable magazines, and folding stocks.	I wonder how many are exaggerated.

'guys' is the plural of 'guy'. you don't seem to be aware that the contraction for 'guy is' is 'guy's.' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor's is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the 'e' and 'd' keys. do you have a better explanation for our origins that doesn't involve magic and dirt?	these are people who believe it and worship evolution like their religion as long as they don't have to believe in a personal god.
0	do you realize, that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being. back when birth control first came out, planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle. so they redefined 'life' to say that you had to draw breth. by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies? 'cause they sure like humans to me. you know most of them can already move before the abotion? look into the court hearings of judge ricard c. caey in new york. if you want to know the truth about abortion.	how is it not, there is one defining moment in life: the fertilization, after that there is nothing were fingers snap and its a baby.

0	Hello, please read http://www.reasons.org/resources/apo...ing.shtml?mainIt is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with Dr Russell Humphreys' hypothesis.The universe and Earth are very old. We know this as a fact. Why would God lie to us? If the Universe looks old, then it is. To claim otherwise is to call God a liar.	I have been reading some of the replies on this page, and yes there is a very new valid way that creationists can explain the fact that we see stars that are billions of light years away in a universe that is thousands of years old.

0	For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all.	Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.

0	But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.	Most evolutionists believe that matter and time were created by a "Big Bang."

Pointing out a different word choice than you would have used doesn't appear to mean anything.If you are certain that their love is not real, why don't you explain your reasoning that led you to this conclusion? It seems to me that a gay person knows his own love better than someone who has never even met that gay person. Do you have some knowledge which disagrees?	since when did we start calling the person we are going to marry partners.
0	I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them).	Waiting until they are born likely gives them no more chance of surviving than killing them in the womb.
1	I'm sorry, did Article V have a clause I'm missing that says you can only amendment the constitution if it accomplishes more freedom?

Under a different circumstance than what you are talking about as in the 2A.
0	Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.	Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail.

1	I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.	The 1967 act "...allows termination of a pregnancy at any time if there is a significant risk of the baby being born seriously disabled.

0	Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.	Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?
1	Dont mind him, hes just sticking up for his new boyfriendemoticonXLove	Now, that is just plain cruel.
0	Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.	Do you not see how this could give the ILLUSION of evolution?
0	So?I look into the clouds and see a cow. Clouds aren't telling me to have a steak.	Alex found exactly the same sequence of primes linked to the same series of biblical messages.
0	No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as "proof" of a young earth.	you might criticize me for believing evolution happened simply because scientists say it did, but alas, thats the reason why.

0	Ah, you've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate. Sad, but predictable.       Obviously, I was discussing the entire article, which is making that argument. It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length.	Another lie.The sentence you've quoted never made any such argument.
0	The counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the Violinist arguments, at the very least.

0	And what is an inheritance? Proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life. 15 Good understanding giveth favor 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid. What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure.

Well, at least they're trying to do it the right way, instead of finding some biased judges to render them some ruling.What I don't like though is the idea that civil unions can't be worked into a more doable institution.
0	Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there.	If you reject the literal account of the Creation in Genesis, you are saying that God is a liar!

0	Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by "higher" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.	It is just amazing that every creature on this planet didn't evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another.

0	So it is claimed.   Tiahrt Amendment Facts | ProtectPolice.org   I've noticed a pattern. Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so. They send a mixed message. It's happened before such as when the NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF. How can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better? It gives us a clue to what the gun lobby's true motives are. Truly disturbing.	tiahrt to holder: read the tiahrt amendment before drawing false conclusions
0	If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.	If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money.

0	Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.	I don't think there are many, who consider the fetus a person in the way you are implying, that are still for abortion "rights".The debate is not if its ok to kill a human being because obviously your not going to get a huge debate on that but rather is the fetus a human being.
0	Accidents for one. Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter.

As for their tax-free status, I would have no problem removing it...just as I'd love to see the ACLU and other crackpot liberal organizations lose their tax-exempt status. emoticonXGood	That being said, I don't really have a problem with Christians, as long as I don't have to pay for their health benefits and pensions, not to mention all of their tax free enterprises.
1	human is defined by whether or not you have a funeral, included in the census, and pay something to the state? a homeless illegal alien is screwed.	if its alive then you should have a funeral for every miscariage, and you should include it in the census and pay accordingly to the state.
0	if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex.	the distinction can matter, so if there is going to be promiscuity going on, i for one would perfer to see it be safe-sex, as much as possible.
0	Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone "up there" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify.	My moral compass does not care if genesis is literally true or not.

0	Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent.	Everyone not a literalist can see that the two accounts conflict when read literally.
0	Well of course everybody is entitled. But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color, using the "black codes" enacted after the Civil War. If it weren't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution, minorities would still be out in the cold.The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment.	I think everyone is agreed that people no matter what race are entitled to equal protection under the law.
0	Thanks, Clive, you're a good sport. Of course I can't agree with the idiot part. Rash, unwise, unknowledgeable, maybe, but not fools.	People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the "idiot" label.Hope this clarifies things for you.
1	I've got a better compromise. We'll keep our magazines in whatever size we please, and we'll ban you, J Miro, Simone, and a random forum troll to be named later. That sounds fair and even in terms of trade to me.	How about a ban on J Miro in exchange for a ban on high cap mags?
0	But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).	then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of, in the worst case, chaos and, in the best case, a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority.

0	Why do conservatives support conservatives? Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas. Luke doesn't have him meet a risen Jesus only Paul says he did. His first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with Barnabas.But the Apostles did not teach the same as Paul, similiar but not the same.	It is not necessary that all the apostles should be equally inspired to only write teachings and letters like Paul, just like all the organs of a body do not take part of the same the function, but the nevertheless, all contribute to the making and building of the body.
0	And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?	I'm not sure what you mean.
0	When the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable.	As rights of only one of two are being considered.
1	archie, that wasn't a prophecy you neo marxist socialist, it was a hope. neo, marxist socialist, eh? three compliments in the same sentence. see you can be nice if you really really try. nice to know i am continuing the proud tradition that my parents established so many years ago. my father voted for debs, and my mother voted for foster. archie, sweetie, your flattery will get you nowhere, try as you might.	that wasn't a prophecy you neo marxist socialist, it was a hope.
1	i disagree with it because there is no god. these are your words: 'i propose that a standard of good or evil cannot be defined by humans or human constructs.' i guess i shouldnt be surprised that i cant get a straight answer. you dont know. i am surprised your 'god' has not provided you with more adaquate ansures.	i submit that you think it is 'too easy' just because you disagree with it.
0	Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called "womens issuses" be in valid?	Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.
1	I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?	8.I just love how Liberals like to twist this to mean that it's the government's responsibility to care for us via food (food stamps), income (welfare checks), Medicaid/Medicare/S-Chip, etc.
0	it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.	can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally (without going through selection) validates darwinism, which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted?
0	there's a fair few problems with this. off the top of my head... what happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child? what consequences would there be for a mother who didn't want to give the name of the father? would there be any? why is only the father punished? having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people. if it isn't consensual, rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs, why punish only one of the consenting individuals? on a more fundamental level: what evidence do you have that having an abortion is 'a mortal sin'? why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept?	will it fly with conservatives and progressives?
0	Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality.	You are in a loud minority, railing against the irrational hoards about you.
0	So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?  Your statement "An abortion never has to be done" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?	Mr. Jack, Abortion doesn't have to be done if the amniotic sack is cut.
1	Only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakicetus_(1).jpg  Replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why I put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy.	but when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater.
0	It's still not right for religious people to have to never speak their beliefs. It's a form of tyranny.	And just specifically what parts are those?Mr.
0	when i was in high school lots of the kids stole stuff all the time... stuff their parents didn't want to buy them, peer pressure etc. i'm not trying to be an ass either i'm just surprised at your views on this...  maybe i'll make a debate and we can see what people on here think.	i don't think lindsay lohan is a good example of any group of people... when i was younger i worked in retail and thieves were everywhere... they just stole because they wanted stuff they couldn't afford.
1	Let's see now....you're Christophobic, Biblephobic, Fundie-phobic, steeped in carnal hedonism, you use derogatory rhetoric against God's people, and what else?Hypocrite!!And Barney Franks a respectable congressman? ROTFLOL!!!!You're clueless, Shooter. I shutter to think where you'll wind up. But we'll have to see what develops. It'll probably be negative, since you've lost your focus.	EasyRider, you truly are a man of God.
1	Jyoshu, stop drinking the Kool-Aid before your brain is totally fried.	It just goes to show double-standards.And Arizona, with it's REAL governor who stands up to the feds, is a state many others only WISH they could be.
1	About a third of the weapons seized in Mexico were referred to the U.S. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   About half were successfully traced. Better than 90% of those to U.S. dealers.   Of course your definition of "minute" might differ from mine.	The lie that was purported based on successful traces of the minute number of weapons Mexico turned over to be traced and identified, while keeping the vast majority from law enforcement?
1	are you one of the hard of understanding people? flyboy got it, even if his rationalisations were insufficient. even so, they were far superior to much of the dross you regurgitate.	or are you one of those 'the holocaust never took place' people?
0	please clarify what you're saying here as it makes no sense to me. what point are you trying to make ? off the top though, any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible doesn't condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act/lifestyle. and who does the anti-defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it.	you don't think we could find denizens of stormfront who would claim that they don't hate black people but they think it is sinful for white and black people to have relationships, and then point to, say, the anti-defamation league and accuse them of hatred?
0	I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.	I suspect, therefore, that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy.
1	This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)	A union between two persons having the customary but usually not the legal force of marriage: a same-sex marriage.
0	So atheism doesn't "need" facts? If it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution, doesn't it need all the facts? If the answer is no, then how can it argue against religion? Miller didn't explain it.	Religion= faith in a deity or deities (rough definition)  Atheism= lack of religion/deities  Therefore, atheism= lack of faith    There is no "faithful" beginning point of atheism.
0	You JUST said they get health care in the hospital! Read your post, where's there NO healthcare. And it IS based on the ability to pay...you just want me to pay for someone else's and in the most inefficient way possible.	We already have the cruelest form of rationing in the world, that which is based on the ability to pay.In LA, if you're rich, you get Cedar-Sinai.
0	I think this is a bad way to put it...the evidence that they earth has been warming since we have had the ability to measure temperature is overwhelming...the cause is unknown and whether or not it is natural is unknown. It does seem fairly narasistic to think in 100 years we have caused so much damage to an earth that at least has been here 10,000 years.	The evidence on global warming, however, is pretty overwhelming.
0	It's all in how you word the questions.You worded the questions with an obvious bias, they did not come across as an honest attempt to learn, but rather as a challenge.Word them properly, and I guarantee you that the people here will be most helpful.WaxyP.S. Your username has a large affect on how you are initially perceived.	It really piques me when someone attempts to assume what my opinion is without asking me.
0	Well, if you breed them, you could get taller monkeys with less hair (and other humanlike characteristics). Even so, it would take a long time.	In fact, the only feasible way that a tree-swinging monkey could change into a man would be through some freak accident (aka -- random mutations.)
1	i love how you are using violence to threaten people. when, your argument is disputing violence.	disagree with this and i'm going to beat the crap out of you.
0	Kronus said this was a win for science. He never mentioned that religion was discredited- never mentioned religion at all. Religion and science are utterly unrelated. Why would you make that connection?	When religion is discredited, is it a "win" for science?
0	The point is that there are plenty of issues that go on in church meetings and denominational conventions that are areas of enormous disagreeement and struggle. It happens--it's not just this issue. You just don't hear about them because the press isn't interested in those issues.	It "isn't controversial" because the vast majority of Christian sects HAVE NO PROBLEM with it.
0	Strawman. The argument is not to do whatever one wishes with ones body. The argument is soley that one does not have to have another attached, ever, against ones will.	The simple fact is, in a civilized society no one has the freedom to do whatever she wants with her own body.
0	Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.	You may not have intended to, but you've given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes, with regards to her family - and you'd stick out of it, regardless.
0	Yes. The assumption happens to be that maybe the bible isn't literal. "Lets look into ourselves, shall we?" Behold we did, and Lo! The Earth is old!	Like most other natural history museums today, the Museum of the Earth takes visitors on a journey through time, telling as fact “the 4.6 billion year history of the Earth.” But visitors will never get an opportunity to check the assumptions at the foundation of this story.
1	I'm one of those cruel heartless bastards that thinks the Constitution doesn't apply to terrorists. Break out the cattle prods and "LET'T PARTY" emoticonXRolleyes	Are we going to give them all green cards and let them into the US?
0	Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.	(Playing devil's advocate)And, by what authority would you deny a woman's "right to choose" an abortion that happens to be "late in her pregnancy?"
0	One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord.	They simply cannot figure out why so many missionaries go over to China and try to convert people.
0	And were THIS the 17th century, I might understand that, but this is the 21st century. We don't "bleed" people to make them well; we don't have barbers performing surgery and we usually have a trained physician in the delivery room.	This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth."
0	Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today.	"http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.htmlThis is quite clearly wrong as Darwin did use it in the 6th ed of Species.
1	Did you even notice that they were not the first to report it? Oh wait, you didn't because you are obviously using the fallacy of selective observation.	Newsweek should be punished by the World Court for inciting riots and causing deaths with a fraudulent story.
1	fend not really. they took it out because it was a blatant pro-christian argument.  and those two threads only serve to prove my point. the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims. there is no science in id. only godiddit.  explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong.  explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution, it's false. that makes no sense whatsoever.  explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted. or are all these products science brought us fake?  the delusion of creation.	both long and religious (in its own context).
1	Well with thinking challenged individuals like slimjim floating around it is no wonder we have a rogue agency with no oversight attacking the honest citizens. See Ruby Ridge and Waco for examples.	http://www.jpfo.org/docs/atf_1979.txt after reading hundreds of horror stories about these type of incidents it is not hard to see that ATF hasn't changed it's focus and goals any.
1	I guess I am just "psychologically conditioned" to be blue eyed.?	so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist?
0	You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.	And would society break down if some individuals are allowed to enter into a legally protecting penumbra institution we call marriage?
0	And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.Mo	I just say we make a law against abortion, and stop the genocide against the unborn.
1	How about the pass that the Clintonistas routinely gave to Bubba for his Oval Orifice tryst with Monica??	Or did you make that up so you could attack me since you have no argument?
1	shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such.	the government should only deal with 'civil unions', regardless of the gender of the individuals involved.
1	wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again.	get over it
0	i noticed..., you got a public apology. i'm impressed ;)	i think it is a hopeless cause, but i'm trying.
1	See, a terrorist attack is probably the sort of thing I would use as an excuse to not go to work...	It's pretty chaotic out there, and God knows how I'm getting home.Yeah not good.
1	i'm shocked! how could hunter mislead me so? emoticonxrolleyes given his previous output, i have to confess that i'm not at all surprised that this was a garbage in, garbage out moment. i feel slightly embarrassed at not stopping to consider the preposterous nature of a 14% figure though emoticonxembarrassed	however, it is more easily understood as: (pop a)x.06=(pop b)x.44 (pop b)/(pop a)=.06/.44=.1364=13.64% one should remember, too, that (pop b) is still part of (pop a).
1	Oh, I agree....private security companies are the answer. Very republican of you.	Surely, in high schools and colleges there could be found several Batman types who would be proud to protect the general public from mentally deranged gunmen by carrying one himself...just in case.If it would save a bunch of lives by having a quick way to snuff out random shooters, I'd be all for an extra tax to cover it...and I hate taxes.
0	what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny.	i can't live in an assisted living center with my partner if/when that time should come, without marriage.
0	no, but i went over there and checked and i guess by time stamp you were first. ;)	have you been reading my posts in the other debate?
1	Get away? We never went near it in the first place.	hard to face the facts, i know... cant seem to get away from the fact that 3 babies die every second because of abortion.
0	truth can be found in god. we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not. for instance, one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone doesn't believe it how true is it? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math. 1 + 1 is 2, 12 inches equal a foot, etc. the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is.	truth can be both subjective & objective bryers choclate chip ice cream is the best in the world.
1	i'll agree with you on some of the things you said, but not the hired gun. america doesn't need to hire guns, we have our own. if what you are asserting is the case, then why would we be where we are right now. and are you saying that israel gets there weapons for free? this is america son, nothing is free if you haven't found out. and our strong ties with israel are more than likely due to the fact that they're more trustworthy than any of the arab nations, thus making a greater ally.	israel, as by far the single largest recipient of us military aid, direct financial aid and trade loan guarantees is the only one that comes to mind.
0	have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution.	personally i don't give rats rear end about your god - neither he, you, the government or the ignoramous in rome will ever have say in what happens to this body.
1	wow, in your very warped world view, people with moral values that defend the most defenseless among us and speak for those who can't speak for themselves are seen as morally perverted by you? how terribly pathetic of you capo. but sadly, i'm not the least bit surprised at how incredibly shallow your perspective is. what boggles the mind though is that you're unable to empathize with a whole class of human beings whom you once were yourself. just think about it capo, can you see what that say's about you?	the individual's right to control her own body, have security of her own person, cannot be imposed upon.
0	What does being a priest have to do with anything? It wouldn't matter if he were a Satan worshipper.	The state knows he is harmelss, but obediance before the law is more important than public saftey in the UK.
1	Name them. Real contemporary people who testified about a real superman. And don't forget to identify the time period and where they lived and their written historical accounts.	Not true.
1	Really? Can you link to a creationist website that does not connect evolution to people doing bad things?	What in the Hell does evolution have to do with people doing bad things?
1	Everyone is welcome to give their opinion on public gun possession here-whether you're for or against gun control (or does gun possession justifies itself) and please state the reasons as well. I would really appreciate it if you guys could include some extra informations regarding this issue.	You would probably get much more out of it if you posted a question here, let people reply, then carry on in a similar way asking questions (even related to replies) and getting reponses.
0	And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.	I won't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal didn't even exist.
1	what about god? so many god-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :) seriously i really don't know much about terrorists. i know that bin laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it.	simply crazy, and scary when you think about it.
1	'lame apologetics'? well, i guess if you say so, with your invincible assurance of being right whenever you open your mouth, it would be futile to contradict you.  at least you haven't accused me of being 'prejudiced' against science.  james.	nowhere are you able to defend christianity marching against the heathen.
1	Then why does god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in Hosea 13:16.What did they ever do to god?Does god fear these people so much he has to have unborn members of their community killed. Un born members who couldn't have possibly done anything to god!	We really are going around in circles on this........My bible through the RCC and Jesus Christ says all life is sacred including that life in the womb.........
0	Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior. Abstinence until marriage is still the best way.	Wait a minute, I fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not.
0	But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done.	That does not mean, however, that we should refrain out of politeness from making statements of established scientific fact just because a listener might have been exposed to contradictory religious beliefs.
0	ridiculous. if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong. daewoo: ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind. id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. it failed. michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic.	(the two points being cases where the video indicates that iders try to use ic to prove id) all i said is that they cannot.
1	fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. that is you doing the same damn thing, hypocrite.	did you ever wonder why you have such a low disapproval rating in your debates with many so people on this site?
0	So parthenegenic births are always female. Where did the X chromosome come from? Is this another case of "POOF, it was a miracle" when faced with reality?	If god could create the world in 7 days then he sure as hell could get someone pregnant.
0	Folding proteins... Show me where and how this happens. Why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another? If this is happening all the time we'd see more mutations all the time.Good theory you've got there. Saying something can happen doesn't mean that it does!	Another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins.
1	Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbor's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competance.	Now, you're advocating that this is what God should do.
1	Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?	In your other posts it was a "baby" CUNx.
1	i love how the government has become the scapegoat for the failure of parents to control their kids, and in turn we are losing more and more civil liberties...	for kids being subjected to things on the internet shouldnt be the governments right to have them see certain things and not see others.
0	Do you have any evidence for that? And still, I don't know what you mean by kind.	God created all things in "Kinds" - a supergiant group.
1	why thank you , and yes i guessed that as you are pretty busy grovelling to the hide and seek champ , so full credit to you and of course the invisible dictator ..., don be shy take a bow .....	i know most of us christians have never heard a retort like that.

0	So much for your cover. Its blown. You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons. Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil. Maybe you will never know - in this life at least :(	well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.
1	how are you proving that when you have gone out of your way to ignore your failures?  tell me, does comic book art prove creationism? does tv props prove creationism? is oil a hydrocarbon? is density sorting in a fluid medium 'ludicrous?' does a theory that requires miracles work on a scientific level?  how is 'why' the same as 'what?' and since when does grammar depend on the person saying it rather than the statement being said? you claimed that taz did not screw up the grammar, yet i did. yet the statements were identical. how are you addressing what i said when you've completely ignored everything i listed?  more yelling. no actual argument.  the whole point of that was to show you make large numbers of asinine statements. do you reject that?  red bold statements don't make a winning argument.	or admit that you lie like this on a regular basis and distort my arguments in order to claim some sick victory which you never earn honestly but by doing what i am proving here that you have done by claiming that i ever said that bees can't fly!

0	Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods.	I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature."
1	In my case, it isn't 'god fearing'.. so much as "believer fearing'	And what exactly is a "God-fearing athiest" anyway?
1	Ah yes resort to attack when you have no case - perfect example. Its a marvellous demonstration of projection.	You are nothing but hayseed busy-body who revels in the belief that you have some sort divine, 'holier than thou', right to stick your nose into other people's business.
1	Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about.	Then they do things like lobby Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF according to Bob Ricker, a former lawyer of the NRA who turned against the organization.
0	And why would I be anti Christianity when I am Christian?   Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I don't believe in Jesus, or something to that extent, I never said anything to that extent, you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it. I believe in the teachings of Jesus. Yes I'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible, My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times. So she's told me all about it, and what its supposed to teach us.	Anyone who finds themselves foolish enough to believe Hitler was a Christian, for whatever reason you want to believe, needs to look up the word 'propaganda.'

0	why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different.	if you don't want another mouth to feed then just take birth control or use a condom.
0	i'm a little surprised- i've found that pot smokers are usually the least pushy. usually they're laid back enough to just offer, unless they forget to offer. i've only ever been pressured to drink by one person, and that's all the peer pressure i've received. i'm not sure if it's the people i hang with, who almost all use something but are very laid back, or if it's that i'd be hard to ressure so that people don't try. what's your experience been?	weed was by far the hardest for me to quit, since it kind of immerses you in the subculture.
0	that is not true. a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural. an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal. the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed, just that they defy physical law. the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven	The same goes for any diety, or imaginary thing, if by definition they are imaginary/supernatural.
0	You know, this little phrase, "minutes before birth," keeps popping up in reference to abortion.Could someone please explain to me the point of having an abortion "minutes before birth"? What is the point?How many, if any, of this sort of abortion is performed?Could I get a really honest answer to that? Please, no lies.How many?Can anyone tell me?	.The irony is that we all fall somewhere on the line of pregnancy from no abortions at all to minutes before birth.
1	go out there and find all kinds of democrat-led, black-led, white-led, mexican-led, etc.. efforts to protect gay rights. just because you can't find them doesn't mean they're against them. saying all republicans are against gay rights because one of them is, is bigoted, stereotypical and childish. quite moronic too. is it also your claim that all blacks are prejudiced because they haven't formed the naawp yet? grow up.	go out there, find all sorts of cases of gop-led efforts to protect gay rights and rub our faces in it!!!

0	So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life. Care to give any examples, or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever?	It is our contention that it's the pro-death advocates who misrepresent the facts in order to justify their infanticidal proclivities and justifications as they release women of all personal responsibility and expect the innocent child to be sacrificed at the alter of their immoral lifestyle so they can continue to act irresponsibly.
0	...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers.	i do believe that the predictions are accurate, but i say 'no' for two reasons: one, stopping the event would create a paradox.

1	But rather than be honest about your mistake, you just changed things without paying any attention to the fact that we've shown you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to the claims of the scientific community.. at least, not until somebody tells you. (And you accuse me of not having a teacher's mentality as I educate you in something you didn't previously know... How pathetic.)	Now if you come back with evidence that Neanderthal buried their dead, and deduce from that a direct relationship with modern man, then surely some chemical relationship has also been discovered since the advent of DNA technology, whether it it nuclear or mitochondrial similarities/connections, or one of the other chemical relationships mentioned above.
1	i love how what you 'personally' feel is in direct conflict with acedemic studies. science says force = mass times acceleration, but i personally feel that force = velocity times volume, so that must be the right answer.	they should be taught just the basics, and children if they are interested can talk about it with their parents or older friends.

Hey, according to PNC=WW3, if I don't like the people who put the information into the State Dept. website, I don't have to believe it. That's according to him.	You accuse "liberals" of spin?The first site that listed NK as being a state sponsor of terrorism was given to you in post #31 right after you asked for specific evidence to counter each point, AND AGAIN IN POSTS #37 AND #42, in which I actually copied and pasted the entire article.Further to that, is it my fault you were incapable of finding the info posted in the "second horses mouth" link when it was right under your nose in the first State Dept.
0	The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough.	the child in the womb feels pain..when you put the needle up there to try to give the child anestesia in the womb, the child moves away to not get stuck by the needle.

1	No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is.	This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart.

They may be "gay" physiologically (whatever that means in terms of biology), but they are living in a way that doesn't give in to that--which is what matters from their religious standpoint.

0	You/he could just have said 'slippery slope' in the first place; that argument is an old one, which I though was dealt with a long time ago. You can't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will, secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A. You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance.	You wouldn't make this statement if you knew about how Britain's current gun control laws came into existence.

Not for safety reasons, of course.And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.	Here are just a small number that come to mind:1) Right to murder2) Right to own slaves3) Right to rape4) Right to abusing children5) Right to vote6) Right to smoke (if you're under 18)7) Right to drink (18th Amendment)8) Right to engage in certain activities in public9) Right to drive as fast as one wants10) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest riverThe list goes on really.
1	Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the "right" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say "All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages". Since we have "a government for the people by the people", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people. You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else.	I am saying that if so religious XXXXX wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then I want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief.

0	Which, we suppose, in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever, right?Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs.Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?	funny that all proponents of abortion for unwanted pregnancies talk about abortion as if being a political statement: I control my body.Funny that they never think that the reason most women need an abortion was because they couldn't control their legs and kept them crossed.They can not control their lust, so much for body control.
0	Because Africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. There are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. Their food sources are different, their territories are different. The more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. Pretty straightforward, really.	And isn't the dark Continent also the natural and original ecosystem where the Great Apes are from?

And considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science. According to you all science should be terrible. Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful?	You realized you just bolded a statement saying that science had nothing to do with "them" accepting evolution (a "material explaination") right?
0	Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.	The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*.

The 'rule of thumb' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood, the more offspring that species has.	Are only a few people in this generation "fit" enough to go on to breed?
0	Since evolution is a non-theistic theory (it does not consider if there is a god or not), you will have to look at some like http://www.theistic-evolution.com/I would also look up Kenneth MIller on the web... a highly Christian biologist who defends evolution.	I do not mean like those awful websites that misrepresent science to try and shoehorn the world into their Bible stories (sorry to pick on Christians here, but it is Christian ones that I notice), but ones that look at real science and look to see if a theistic explaination works for things?
0	Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.	So limiting the capacity has no affect on crime.

0	ah i see. so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to, unless they pay the government more money? sound a little too much like bribery to you too? and how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing? how about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society, and let people kill themselves/ruin their lives if they want to. why should i be spending tax dollars (ok, well hypothetically, pretend i pay taxes) to force someone else to not hurt themselves? sound a little counter-productive? and then we complain about a defecit? (obviously that's not the main culprit of spending, but you get the point).	furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drugs, which would be a good thing.
0	I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.	Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.
0	I'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion. Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young. Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful.	But if you do, make sure you protect your identity.
1	depends on what you mean by 'history'.  did george washington really cut down the cherry tree? that is fiction. did george washington exist? that is documented.. and is history.	don't you think this is a better definition?
1	Exactly, they are big on condeming the sins of those other guys. It makes them feel better about themselves. Also, it is always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homos are not going to disappear, abortion will never be made illegal. That's how the religious right recruits folks - get 'em all indignant about the "others" and they never notice they are being fleeced by the fat little pastor.	(I'm going to have to borrow that story... :p I can't help but wonder for some people if the reason they "mature" on the issue of heterosexual sex has to do more with the fact that they start wanting to do it themselves.A desire to partake in the action, as opposed to actual mature development, causes them to shift their attitudes towards heterosexuality.To me, that's one of the reasons Christianity (in general) has such a "tolerance" for divorce, which Jesus spoke out against explicitly, while not as much tolerance for homosexuality.They want to do the divorce thing or sympathize with the desire for it, so suddenly it's more "tolerated"... emoticonXRolleyes

0	I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. Any thoughts on this?	In particular, I'm not sure about your conclusion here:"The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken.

(in fact he defended separation of church and state.) the text of the speech is here (among plenty of other places accessible via google search) for people to draw their own conclusions.	i think he basically intimated that only believers have anything of worth to contribute to american society, and that the separation between church and state was a bad idea.
0	What do you mean by other definitions? Before you stated "Creation is...." thus it is implicit in this that you are arguing against a single homogonous construct.

0	read the rest of the post. i added to it before you responded to make what i said clearer: why would you be maligning them if they were not bad? the intended effect is that you would deserve the same maligning you were giving since what you were doing was equally as bad. since you malign something bad, it is generally understood to mean that the speaker considers you to be as bad as those you malign.	the person doing the maligning is not the same person as the one speaking the line, 'you're no better than the people you malign'.
0	Quite frankly, that makes absolutely no sense.So conservatives in the blue states will buy more porn because why? Cause they are in a blue state?And liberals in the red states will buy more porn because why? Cause they arein a red state?Your excuses lack any cogent theory behind the scenario.In science, when people put forth a hypothesis they provide a basis for their claim as to the mechanics of the phenomenon.But with you, you just throw out different ideas with no basis.	In no way did I say that either party purchased the most porn, nor did I differentiate between red and blue states.
1	So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.	That will take the criminals off the street and with them off the street there are no gun control concerns.
0	This isn't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise. Once out of the womb and living on his/her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb. Much like you can drive but this 'right' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything.	I put to you that you are the one discriminating on the basis of someone's size and development, since you would have it that a small, slightly developed person has a right to inhabit a womb, while a fully grown adult does not.
0	How is that a affect of deterrence? Deterrence works by preventing people through the fear of consequences. A dead man has no fears. Furman Vs.

1	So lets see, you referred to how the 1st amendment applied to the states, posted the 14th amendment privileges and immunities clause and then asked if I thought something was unclear. Of course the privileges and immunities clause is often mistaken to have incorporated the 1st amendment by people who don't know what they are talking about but this is merely coincidence because you randomly quoted part of the 14th amendment but implied it all. Now if I changed it to what it said above would you feel that is an accurate statement? Probably, considering you don't seem to understand a blatant difference between "original understanding" and "original constitution).Your pride ruins you my friend.	14th amendment: "The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law..." Is there something in that you find unclear??
0	i see some names that don't seem to fit. c.s. lewis was a writer and scholar, you want to include tolkien too? aristotle was a prolific thinker but hardly conservative. it is as if you are trying to graft liberal (proper use of the word) philosophy on to traditionalism. you have rand, do you mean rand paul or ayn rand? quotes about the size of government from conservatives and founder types... it is the size of government that matters, not necessarily how it is financed. - dan mitchell senior fellow in political economy, the heritage foundation my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. - jefferson government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one. - thomas paine  what do you have to say about the 'proper' size of government?	who said what you claim conservatives say?

0	That's not true -- actually, it doesn't make sense. Science is just a bunch of rules (by definition). "Biology uses science to study life" is true. "Physics uses science to study the physical world" is true, but "science's purpose is to study life" is not true.	its difficult to merge life in its purest form with science, even though science's purpose is to study life.
1	True until proven otherwise eh? Xcaliber and you must get along great.You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.No logician (and by extension no good scientist) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'.	I think this paragraph should answer your questions thoroughly.
1	oh yes matt, i'm just an angry little ogre who can't stand to think that gays might find happiness in this lifetime, [sarcasm]. get a clue matthew, i have no personal investment at all regarding your life or your lifestyle. all i'm doing is sharing the spiritual truths that you hate to hear or consider. don't blame me because you live a life of delusions and self deception, because that is the life you are living. and none of those so called good people who encourage and show tolerance for your chosen lifestyle are your friends at all. and yet you prefer their lies to my truth. go figure huh?	archangel just does not want gay people to get married because he is mean.

0	Well, assuming that when the Bible says "you" in passages that are telling "you" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says "women and men have souls." This doesn't mean they don't have them.Same thing with animals. The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says "you" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says "animals don't have souls."So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).	:)I didn't say it, nor does the Bible, that only males of the human race have souls.

0	People have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions. Many people once believed that the earth is flat:perhaps some still do. But this has nothing to do with scientific truth.There is no "version" of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities.By definition, scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment. Any law, knowledge, etc. thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account. All science in this sense is provisional.The apostles may have believed that Jesus walked on water: that does NOTmake it true.	Sure, it's got a lot of believers, but historically it is not the only vision of science people have believed in.There is metaphysical evidence.

What I'm asking is, does this bill mean that ANY issue that could come up as an amendment would be illegal? And if not, (the more important question) how would they determine what constitutes civil rights. (Which you didn't answer, but rather basically said 'I don't know but rest assured they do' (to paraphrase). Get it now? Anyway, on further review, I believe that the bills only apply to whatever falls under the catagory of 'civil rights', however the heck that is to be determined! emoticonXDonno	This bill would exclude matters of civil rights from the subjects which would be valid targets of this process.

1	Back in 1967, societal view of marriage was opposite-sex. Wait ... it's STILL that way. (Seen the ballot initiatives around the country?!) The point is that letting blacks marry whites didn't fundamentally redefine marriage, because it was still between a man and a woman.	Back in 1967, "societal views of marriage" meant SAME RACE MARRIAGE ONLY, by an overwhelming majority that supercedes that seen today against gay marriage.

0	A more precise term would be "broaden," since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, "diluted" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only "change" would be to other  people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only "change" in that regard will be the fact that they are  encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.	Change the definition of a legal term, something that is done daily, to benefit a class of citizen currently discriminiated against legally and socially.

Kronus, if you had the Spirit of Christ living inside you like the Bible says his followers have, you would be preaching / defending Jesus instead of warming up to a pagan infidel like Orion, who has now spent some 8 years slandering and attacking the Biblical Jesus (chanting "gay jesus") and most anyone who believes in Him.

0	Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences.

Essentially everything is with the exception of "organic".

I haven't read from all sides, however.	you may, but firstly, that argument may well not fly - much of the grain going to these animals is essentially the trash left over from other production to begin with, unfit for human consumption.

I, for one, would buy a gun If I knew my neighbor had six, and he wanted me dead.The CIA and American military carried out immoral operations in 60+ countries since 1945. The soviet KGB, as far as I know, has only been in Germany, korea, China, and Afgahnistan.	1989, the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down, along with Soviet Ideology.Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it.
1	so the quickest way to get over 20,000 points is to not be serious? check!	yes..., this is how i got 21,157 points..., and counting ;)
0	You can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. There are very many forms of evidence.	Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms.
1	That is exactly what he is here for. To spread god's.. 'love'.	Why does they admin let EZ post comments like this to other people, if he can't be vicl and debate like an adult to others, why is he here......to spread god's love ...right?
0	i love that you guys dont seem to be joking when you talk about it being offensive to gays - if anything i would think only tom cruise would find it offensive - because of his claims that he isnt gay (obviously untrue) gays would probably cheer if he (along with his penis) would come out of the closet if someone would find this offensive, it wouldnt be me vs gay guys - it would be me vs overly sensitive and selfrighteous guys who happen to be gay	i also think 'tom cruise's gay penis' is a bit too offensive toward gays and i would never have that name because of that.
0	Really? A human can be determined scientifically. Personhood is a human legal construct. You cannot prove scientifically what a "person" is.	If we can prove a person was at a crime scene through DNA evidence.
0	lazy jason, darling, but you very sadly lack one item of attractiveness, the freshness and beauty of innocence.	i have to carry a razor blade tucked under my thigh because so many of these 'beauty' queens try to top my glamor.... sorry sister there's no gold for second place... well if you studied math you'd know that two second place little runner ups does not beat one.
0	Lurch, I don't appreciate your condescending tone. If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions, you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin's Black Box.	If you want to challenge my assertion that these are transitional you will need to understand a bunch of words that you may have never heard before, like furcula, carina, hallux, gastralia, pubis, fibula, fenestra, pygostyle, and so on.
1	Spoken like a true Conservative, not one of those liberal "compassionate conservatives". emoticonXGood	You have two completely different things in your question so, I'll just split them up.Social programs (armed redistibution of wealth).I only agree with those allowed by the U.S. Constitution or by the respetive state constitution.
0	originally posted by fracas only way to be more efficient is to continue to wage war preferentially against technologically similar sides are we back to a us-eu war? sorry i took that the wrong way, but regardless, the kind of thinking that leads to wars and seeing who has the largest most powerful military is precisely what i'd like to get away from in order to advance the military. yes we learn from war, but its wasteful, i'm proposing a not so wasteful military.	you have a penchant to create strawman; never said we should wage constant wars what about one every decade or so?
0	while i can't say i'm a history buff, i'm not shocked about all that either. perhaps it's because i'm mostly a misanthropist.	but at the same time requires that same government to be genuinely benevolent which doesn't happen 9 times out of 10 when you give a person or group of people that kind of power they will abuse it.
0	It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. "Macro" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different.	I point out what stuck out to me...What I saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed "recent immigration," than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time, unless I misinterpreted it.
1	So you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? That someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? What if it where your nipples? After all nipples on men serve no purpose.	Geez, your not normal if you don't have it circumcised.
0	honestly, i am amazed, so there are actually gay people with a sense of reason. i have spent years of facing discrimination from narrow minded homosexual activists and all these years later, you are the only one that has ever demonstrated somewhat of a sense of reason beyond the same old hogwash i have seen demonstrated by thousands i have interacted with. i still have my reservations towards suspecting that somehow you might be attempting to set me up for a slam.	all i did was say his statements actually have some validity.
1	so basically, what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever. they shouldn't teach tolerance, because that offends the intolerant; they shouldn't teach racial equality, because that offends racists; they shouldn't teach religious freedom, because that offends religious bigots. maybe they shouldn't teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers.  i am truly surprised to hear a right-winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum. but then, i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today.	now, you and i don't agree with that, but the question here is whether or not the school should teach about issues that moralistic ones in peoples' minds, such as this one.
0	Because we view it as something much more than just a gravy train from the govt., that's why.For you it seems to be about the word, and the govt. saying "oh, you use THAT term ("marriage"), ok we recognize it." For us it's about the commitment.	Then why are you and other "antis" so hung up on preserving it for your exclusive use?
1	Big Bear, ye mae be thinkin' o the Mennonites. Er the Hutterites, er the Amish. Er mebbe the followers of thet Zwingli feller.	Isn't there some evidence that shows that the early Church was communist(notice the small c) in nature ?
0	The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life.	The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic.
0	arafat is not a worse leader than sharon... arafat steals millions in aid money that is suppose to go to the palestinians, which 80% of them are below the poverty line. arafat advocates people to xxxx themselves up so that they may kill as many jews as possible. he is the head-figure of many of these terrorist groups and pours millions of aid into them.  sharon is worse? not only has arafat contributed to many more than 1,000 israeli casualties, his 'intifada' has continued the cycle of violence and thus caused the death of more than 2,000 palestinians.	but arafat is not a worse leader than sharon...
1	Probably neat excuse. Do you expect jim to back that claim up? emoticonXGood Don't hold your breath.	Any evidence to support this or is it just a neat excuse not to take any action?
0	The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science.	The problem with ID is that there is no evidence, and it is simply not possible to falsify it.
0	1 - It is innacurate. We allow killing in times of war, in self defense, and in state sanctioned executions. So we already have a situation where, when given X mitigating factors, it is justifiable to take a life. It is impossible to say all life is equal, and then to apply that as law. People will be outraged. I know I would be.2 - Objective to who? Who gets to decide how valuable life is? And why should they get to? And who says they are right? The relative value of life works fine, thanks very much.	If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?
1	And refusing to donate your resources is killing, so I have killed someone by not donating my blood etc.	Jessica,What do you not understand Jess?
1	honk! wrong. my parents inherited a house from their parents. they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values. concepts stored in one brain, expressed via words and encoded in a new brain. epigenetic inheritance, yet still materialistic. doesn't mean they didn't also inherit a bunch of genes, and for the umpteenth time it doesn't mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like. shouldn't i be asking you that, since that's what you say happens, despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up? honk! what a great big fat juicy lie, ss. don't put it in the keep net though; toss it back so you can use it again later.	(how exactly does it happen that thought or awareness generates a new physical trait and then pass it down?)
0	So what? I don't care! Gun ownership is an individual right and that's the end of it! You don't have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the Constitution.	"The opportunity for a law-abiding gun owner to use a gun in a socially desirable manner--against a criminal during the commission of a crime--will occur, for the average gun owner, perhaps once in a lifetime.
0	wow, you're only 17? i definately had you in mid 30's maybe early 40's.	if the user does not have a brain, then obviously it, just like bread knives, stairs and folding umbrellas, is dangerous.
0	Cars are a privilege, your gun isn't. Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional.	Having to register guns will inevitably lead to a complete ban on guns, just as automobile registration has led to an outright ban on automobiles.
1	Where is your "proof" that a magical being in the Heavens created us ?	What evidence are you looking for that it exists?Hey – You guys say man evolved.
0	having been raised in texas as a child and teen, with many relatives still residing there, i'm surprised their educational system hasn't gone to the bible as its primary textbook. perhaps things have changed, but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas. maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed, but i'd find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique.	emoticonxconfused i didn't say that, our teacher didn't show us the texas version, just jokingly told us about it.
0	It is horribly oppressive of women, though, to oppose both abortion and contraceptives. That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all.	You can believe it all you want...If you don't believe in abortion and you don't believe in any kinda of birth control then that is your belief...it doesn't contradict itself.
0	i think in the mind of a psychopath with boundary issues, what the woman was wearing, or where she was at does not matter at all. how do you explain people who get raped in their homes? how about people who aren't dressing slutty, they're just having a drink with a friend, but that friend turns out to have a darkside? i really hope you're joking though.	they didn't follow these #safetytipsforwomen or else they'd have all been fine.
1	be sure and count the number of hits vs. the number of misses of some well trained leos. sap, remember your postition you took now on citizens might miss and hit some innocent person? read 3 or 4 versions of this shootout and learn something! lots of useful information in there.	all of these are interesting reads about the fbi shootout with two perps.
0	You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.	This means that murderers who don't get birthday cakes, a basketball court, tv, and a turkey for Thanksgiving go crying cruel and unusual punishment and then they get it.I've heard that the average cost of living of a capital punishment prisoner is appoximately $25,000.00 a year paid for by us.It's really bad when murderers on deathrow in Mexico are calling murderers on deathrow in America p*****s and want to transfer here.LEVIATHAN
1	And I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.	sorry if i had offended u.
1	So you believe if a kid threatens to shoot up the school it should be just ignored as children"s innocent mischief..........Tell that to the kids that died at Colombine..... emoticonXRolleyes	You know they arrested a teenaged boy, here in michigan, for making the suggestion of doing a school shooting.
1	Excuse me, I stand corrected. For 'pretend' please substitute 'wrongly believe'.	I am not "pretending" to beilieve you to be a materialit/darwinist.
0	agreed. god does exist in some form, whether you want to call god a supreme being or whatever, there is a greater power out there thats beyond our comprehension. in the meantime lets all just get along	if there was no god explain how we are here there has to be some sort of god out there its kind of obvious...
1	I guess I'd rather live among them, too, than have a hot poker shoved up my bottom.	You may call the Amish "stunted" and "misguided", but I would much prefer to live among them (in the absence of technology) than in some inner city ghetto.
0	Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other.	The poor shooter probably thought, quite innocently, that his fellow countrymen might be about to shoot him with their concealed carries, he shot them first, a perfectly reasonable response.
0	Not needed? It is evolution. The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene. The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations. It is by definition, evolution.	The ONLY reason is natural selection.
0	this statement isn't logical.It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or can't change them...or even that they apply to him. If a teacher says "no talking in the classroom" it doesn't apply to the teacher now does it.	Let's see who's going to be consistent about their beliefs.
1	i think your right big orn and that is what i was thinking... do you think your level of bitterness has something to do with quality of life? i guess the glass is half empty for those....	so it's a telling story...sometimes, know what i mean?
1	yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own.	you agreed with trebor pappy.....now you are back pedalling..re previous post
0	You mean, the perpetrator is convicted and the defender acquitted? Yes, that's the rule and not the exception. Notice here how no-one ended up dead, or even particularly seriously injured. Additionally the circumstances described are incredibly rare, that's why it makes the news.	When you threaten to rape and murder and entire family, and you're in less trouble than the person you threatened, that's not a sign of the country being safe or worth living in; especially when this is the rule and not the exception.
0	Regardless of the name change, the calendars are still keyed on the birth and death of Christ...and that will be so at least until the atheists are able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentalities.	actually, the more common usage would be CE.
0	No. We know that evolution happens. What would be a problem would be to find the processes that made evolution happen as such incredible rates. There isn't any evidence that it can happen that fast.	Nearly all informed evolutionists will admit that without billions of years their theory is dead.
1	Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence. You mean like Bill Ayers (sic) and his wife or Carl Rowen? Wait my bad they aren't from the right.	You needn't be far left to support reasonable gun regulation.What current firearm related issue would drive an "anti-gunner" to commit a terrorist act?Or are you just lumping anyone who supports gun control in with PETA and radical environmental groups?I'd be watching for the next murderous domestic terrorist to come from the ranks of those sporting teabags.
1	Yes, necessarily for YOUR genocidal rantings. But not for actual reality.	<snip>There is NECESSARILY no innocent Muslim.
1	You jsut don't get it. You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not. What part of that do you not understand. You say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. How cruel can you be	I agree it's not an 'academic exercise', but not for the same reason you think.I no more take 'pleasure and joy' from something like this than any other public act of due process, e.g.
1	what? naaah,... all we have to do is deny the suspects are 'persons' then we can do any emoticonxcensored thing we want to with them and there's no moral aspects to it at all,... just like abortion and (at one time) slavery. one thing that has always puzzled me,... 'how is it that enemy combatants and convicted murderous terrorists can come away with more rights and sympathy from the left than a prebirth little human child can?' (scratching head) emoticonxconfused how is it that a leftist can see more outcries for humanity in a whale, dolphin, spotted owl or field mouse than they do in an actual prebirth human child? one of the great mysteries of the modern world, i suppose.	like torturing suspects because the preznit says so?
1	How does this address your claim that the Second Amendment served as a defense against a tyrannical federal government? Are you moving the goalposts now?	I'm not sure what you're claiming is a contradiction.
0	Does any part of the theory of evolution give an accounting of how we transitioned from quadruped movements of the ape to biped?	No, there were never any Quadruped humans.
0	The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it.	Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad (or constitutional), or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad (or constitutional), it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban.
1	Then God should have used someone they trusted and respected to deliver that message. emoticonXRolleyes	Perhaps the answer to the prayer was to go to the doctor and these parents didn't listen.
1	How do they use "the empirical evidence prove it", when they do no research, and no evidence actually supports their "theory"?	Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture, they let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done.
0	And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation? I'd also like a link to verify what you say. Thank you. God Bless!	I have to ask: have you actually read what you just quoted?
1	Forgive me. A few minutes with Google ought to give enough info to refute what he said, so I didn't bother.	I didn't realize you could just summarily disregard a poster's source without providing any info to back this up.
0	take it up with who brought it up. who said the idea of it being 'scientific' is the criteria for a theory to be taught in schools?  schools have to have some degree of autonomy to have the curriculum they want without over-regulation. who sets the standard of what's 'scientific' or not?	but, if you accept that it is not a scientific theory, why should it be taught in a science class?
1	<sarcasm mode on> it's sexual assault because when she sobered up and realized what she'd done, the little darling couldn't possibly have been responsible for her own actions.  <sarcasm mode off>	if she brushes her teeth and does other things to suggest she's drunk rather than fully mentally incapacitated and then has sex, why is it sexual assault?
1	So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?	(I felt the holy spirit .. take your lithum kid).. )

0	Another cheap attempt at diversion on your part? Once again, EZ, I'm not taking your diversionary bait. Instead, I suggest that you give some serious consideration to the nature of your sources. Doing so will save you a lot of humiliation.	in a link he gave over at the USAT Creation / Evolution Forum:
1	Well, this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum, it is likely, he'd be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe'd actually be contributing to the pro-choice position...	What are you referring to here?
0	Actually, society hasn't said this. 5 judges, in very recent times, have. I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old. I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the "18 and over execution rule" in the eighth amendment.	We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.
1	Yea right you are likely to know. Stick with the enema hotline.	but you fondle your guns alot more than her"Men possess handguns in order to compensate for sexual dysfunction."

0	'Most Biblical scholars'? If you mean they think the letters are forgeries and weren't at least dictated by Paul, then it's just not true that most Biblical scholars think that. I agree in terms of the idea that Paul in some cases had someone else actually put the words on paper and he told them what to write, but that's pretty irrelevant here, IMO.	Just interjecting...several of the letters attributed to Paul were not writen by his hand according to most biblical scholars.
0	But wouldn't the biochemical similarities speak for themselves? That is, does one have to believe that the two specimens (which share biochemical similarities) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics? The observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient (and more scientific?).	Quote:So it would make sense that a mold (which is a type of fungus) shares the same common ancestor that other fungi share, and would have a lot of biochemical similarities with them which it would not share with bacteria.
1	Why doesn't this apply to Soviet Russia - which had a population of similar size ? Presumably, your answer would be that the USSR was less "developed" than the US ?	.And of course the US will have more Nobel prizes; as one of the more populous developed countries there will naturally be a larger pool of humanity from which to pull.
1	oh yes, the flood that left no trace of ever occuring. gotta fear the threat of nothing! i'm so afraid of a flood that never happened!  as for sodom, well, i practice good hospitality. i don't know about you. you know, god isn't going to be happy when you keep limiting its power by calling it a 'he' all the time. god is limitless, it has no gender.	you may not believe it but morals wise this country is going to hell in a handbasket, and if the 'big guy in the sky' is looking down at things that are happening here he can not be happy...... judgment day might be on us sooner then we think..... you can scoff at that though......that is the same thing they did before the big flood and the destruction od sodom...........

0	I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, "And the truth shall set you free"!!!	Give to God what belongs to God.
0	Yes, you are missing something. How come age doesn't start at conception? How come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old.	But then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the US Census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage.
0	if someone is an attorney or in law enforcement, would you please give an interpretation? thank you.	no, if they sign their name, it does not mean where they live becomes a matter of public record.
0	Almost?   Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.	The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population.

1	Abortion is not immoral? End of story? Simone, are you trying to impose your own personal moral code upon me? Well I never....	Hmmm, I just think it is dead wrong to force your morals upon someone else and especially heinous when your morals are WRONG.Abortion is not immoral.
0	it can't always be cared by anyone. What if no one wants the baby or you can't get to a place where you can give the baby up (maybe snowed in for a week). Can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you.	And, of course, you totally miss the point.The point is that a 1-day-old infant can be cared for by ANYBODY!
1	Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns.	It has 'splintered' in the fact there are more than one way to interpret things.. and how strictly one follows the rituals.
1	Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.	Which leaves anyone believing that nonsense in the OP looking rather foolish Best rush out and buy an extra gun or two in case it might be true.
0	You are very right. We too will have to pay tax on the insurance for me. Not fair.	That being said, I still have to pay tax on my partner's health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union.So it has to be marriage.
1	are you a little bit retarded or something? don't get me wrong sleazyrider i love babies, they're delicious!	how many babies have you supported killing?
0	let me guess - you also believe that moses wrote the torah, wherein he describes his own death and burial? 'wild theory'? i suggest you do an internet search on the synoptic problem and the related two-source theory.  why do you demand that which you know cannot be produced? no, we don't have the q source, but we have evidence which points to a q source. likewise, we have a great deal of evidence which suggests that the torah had multiple authors.	these liberal theories of yours are only that - theories, with no historical, archeological, or traditional evidence to support them.
0	Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed.	the big news here has nothing to do with dinosaurs and chickens: it's that proteins were found in dinosaur bones after supposedly 68 million years.

0	i'm a little surprised by this. the polls i've seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage. i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem.	are not happy about this move.
0	There are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth. Some use 'science' to say that the world is flat. Granted that these beliefs aren't widely accepted, but then not all religions are widely accepted. By your reasoning or 'logic' you must ask yourself about whether you should rely on science when there are many different scientific theories.The Flat Earth News, at least back then, had a regular column, "One Hundred Proofs Earth is Not a Globe."(go to http://www.flat-earth.org/)Other theories taught as sciencephrenologyalchemyevolutioneugenicsneptunismTheories of the Aether Articles relating to the Emergence of Scientific Theories of the Cosmic Aether(http://www.mountainman.com.au/aether.html)What about 'metascience'?http://www.calresco.org/lucas/science.htmOr, sciences used to support political ends...What about Marxist Sciencehttp://www.marxists.org/archive/hald...philosophy.htmor Chaos Theory and Marxismhttp://www.marxist.com/science/chaostheory.htmlThere's Nazi Sciencehttp://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/naziscience.htmlNationalist Sciencehttp://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htmOr social ends...Scientific Racismhttp://www.press.uillinois.edu/f02/tucker.htmlMainstream scientists instead of using the word 'heretic' use the word 'pseudo-science' to categorise fringe beliefs.	so yes the existance of other religions can be seen as disproof for your god, becuas logic dictates that you must ask yourself why your god didint speak to people in asia or south america.
1	To bad you don't have the power to define the situation.	Or have you entirely abandoned that effort?Btw only you guys are calling it fine print, loophole, weasle hole, whatevas.
1	All sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you.	I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.
0	ok, great so far. we're getting some good predictions on both sides. i think this is going to be a lot of fun to look back at in time. keep it up. more topics... cap and trade. will strict controls be placed? what effects if so? iraq. will he pull out? what happens then? (with iraq or terror here or whatever) how much $$$ will he throw at the economic crisis? what will the outcome be? anything you all want to predict or comment on concerning the upcoming presidency will be appreciated. have fun!	the following is edited down to one point: social security is not strictly 'disability' insurance.
1	Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.	Everything that happend in the universe happens according to "laws."
1	If that's the case I wish someone would unplug me. I'm getting tired of this version of reality.	I cant prove he lived.. and you cant prove he didnt.I however could pull out this 2000 year old book, and the dead sea scrolls.. and say... well.. people have believed he did.. and wrote about it.And the level of detail is such that it would be difficult if not impossible for his existance to be a fable...except of course... we may all be living in a matrix computer program and all this stuff we see right now... maybe an illusion.. so..-Mosheh Thezion
0	While I'm not going to consider Dr. Tiller a pillar of society, I'm certainly not going to condone his murder.	I don't think you will find many reasonable people thinking it should be anything different.
1	Where do you get off saying that kind of tripe to somebody?  That kind of insane comment is typical of far left loons like you who lie for a living and don't have the common sense of a fence post.  And that goes for Jo Bennett too if he's agreeing with you.  Cretins.	as i said before just because you don’t realize it doesn’t mean that it is not influencing you to do what everyone else is doing.
1	i love when differing from someones opinion is 'weak'. such a convincing argument.	there is no need for you all (y'all) to feel as i do.
0	i think this is something everyone on here can get behind. at least i would hope so. saying that fred phelps is an embarrassment to this nation and my home state would be a gross understatement. sadly, i can't say i'm surprised by this, but i definitely don't think i would have ever predicted it. what he is doing is despicable. and what the patriot guard is doing is amazing. i like the sentiment involved in attempting to pass laws against protesting at funerals (although i don't know if they'll hold up in court), i only wish they had felt the same when he was protesting aids victims.	the church, westboro baptist church, is not affiliated with a larger denomination and is made up mostly of fred phelps' extended family members.

0	Thank God. I too hope it doesn't keep going back and forth. While I live across the river in Parkville, Missouri, I used to live in Overland Park Kansas and went to school there. I think they are generally pretty good public schools, it's just the state school board that keeps effing everything up when they get some christonazis on board.	Hopefully it won't continue to go in this back and forth forever.
1	Are we talking about the same Obama here? The same one, who's head of the DHS, told law enforcement to be on the lookout for anyone who disagreed with the government?	If Obama had his way, standing against the government would be the most patriotic thing someone could do.
0	Exactly. Most people would incorporate it, from childhood most often. Steeeeve can't seem to wrap his mind around that.	I suspect that a lot of people, if not most people, at least partially follow some version of "treat others as you would have yourself be treated".

1	absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years.	'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned.
1	Exactly my point! After four pages he finally gets it! Give him a hand! There's a brain in that head after all! But my point is, that unless you do disagree with the stats, your argument is irrelevant.   [QUOTE]What I have been saying for the last three pages is that your question is idiotic, as you're comparing things which are completely different in function. They are not analogous.	Let me say that again:I never said your stats were wrong.
1	yeah, like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will. you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them? i was going to say that you live in your own little world, but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen.  what? either try that again, or find someone who can translate. i kinda thought that the insecure, paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security. i don't need to carry a gun, i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me. i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security, and as such, want to carry a gun. there is a difference.	well, it seems that even the simplest of messages failed to penetrate some thick (sick) skulls: without guns you can not shoot and kill anybody.
1	they must suffer terribly in the deep snows of the canadian winter, eh? no wonder they're pouring south over the border. little emoticonxcensored ers.	rumor has it that they all sneak in across the border from canada.they work for peanuts, send all their money back to their families and expect everyone to learn gnomish and give them drivers' licenses!
1	oh do tell us of this dooms day event, will we need new nike sneakers and $1.75 in our pocket when we all die?	Err, no correction necessary, I just felt like saying Enrapture.No the dooms-day will not be on the arrival of the asteroid, that has nothing to do with it, the dooms-day event will be a terrible event, even for the innocents, wrong on both accounts.
1	Even if winnie the poo could read he simply doesn't have the brain power to comprehend.	This from a Sumo Spainiard barricaded in a basement?You got so many things wrong here it would take a book to cover them all and you can't read.
0	No it doesn't, as abortion WAS a legal option in this case.   This was not a legality issue, but an education issue.	Shows what lengths women can go to if legal abortion isn't an option.
0	we do! on npr (which is our national public radio) they play the bbc world news daily. it is a fantastic source, i must agree.	for serious news: http://news.bbc.co.uk for other 'news': http://www.digg.com for science news: http://www.newscientist.com/ some of you guys in the us should definitely give the bbc a try for world news.
1	The tooth fairy has a different function than the Easter bunny.	What you guys need to learn is that the soul has a different function than a brain.
1	You still trying to push your propaganda film? Let me ask you something, why would the fetus try and avoid the forceps? An infant will cheerfully try and grip a knife that is about to end it's life.	Well there is bias on both sides of the issue.........I did look at the film from about 3 different sites and I don't think you can deny that baby is trying to avoid those forceps that want to take its life..........
0	can you support this moronic statement? the answer is obviously no. also, why should obama be less responsible for his own words on guns and religion than palin is for the words of her audience? the media will follow palin through the gates of hell and beyond to find something to demonize her. what lengths won't they take to attack republicans?	palin was giggling with joy when she saw how her supporters responded to her racist hints.
1	'define'? as if it's a definition? tell me, archie: precisely how ignorant of this topic are you? so you want me to give you the better part of what could amount to a semester-long advanced college course in a single post? do you really think that you'll understand curvature of space-time as induced by matter when you can't even understand the difference between a scientific theory and a drunken guess? do you really think i have any inclination of trying to tell you about the technicalities of relativity when you don't understand that light and gamma rays are the same thing? get real. you need to get your head out of your xxx before you'll be able to even hear me.	and if so, what effect does it have on the light or gasses that pass between them genius?
0	just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.	Reducing women to pretty quote that is hung in your kitchen doesn't mean squat out in here in the real world, and it doesn't indicate that you get it, let alone care.
1	Nice spin. Would you have preferred "the civilized world" instead? Or Western Civilization or Gay Western Civilization? Your preference? One case in 1959 isn't a pandemic.	It's disease vector into the north american contanent just so happened to have been via a gay man, yes,.. so it was in that population in north america that got hit the hardest.
0	The goal of anti-abortionist is clear. The job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters.	In turn, this might increase the chances of an abortion.
0	They need to keep their opinions to themselves and out of the law the effect gay peoples lives. I see nothing wrong with locking up those who incite hatred towards gay people just as we lock up people who shout fire in a crowded theatre.	[i][indent]"Canada has "hate" speech/crimes laws and regulations and Canadian Christians, along with other people of faith, are being vehemently persecuted for speaking out publicly against the acceptance and promotion of homosexuality within their own country.
1	psh if i had to f*&^ hillary i'd cheat too! i mean i'm gay but lord have mercy! lol... but getting back to the subject at hand. simone hun honestly just stop with the cook theories and whoever else even believes them. bush and dick had no idea of 9/11 we all didn't.  i find it a sad irony that we discover the warning signs after the incident... we're only human and we all make mistakes... oh and fyi we did not land on the moon.. simone told me it was made of cheese and that there were giant moon rats eating and eating until one day the moon will be gone... that's why there are holes in it. it's true!!! honestly!	do you think slick willie knew about any thing beside tail?

1	True they should have passed raincoats and knee boots to protect peoples clothes from the XXXX that the president was spewing out.	Now I certainly think that Cindy should have been simply removed rather than arrested, but whats done is done.
1	Absolutely. Because atheists are spiritually constipated and are too dumb to realize God and Christ are real.	Do you believe they (atheists) should not be allowed to display their message but the church should be allowed to display theirs?
1	what are you talking about?!?! the constitution was written in the late 1700's we have to go by thier meaning not a modern interpretation, this is most silly. as for your quote on adams i do not see how that even remotley applies to this discussion... care to expound?	john adams explained that women were not part of 'the people' because 'nature has made them fittest for domestic cares' and women were unfit for 'the great business of life, and the hardy enterprises of war, as well as the arduous cares of the state'.
0	So what? It's not like institutions in this country haven't been changed before, including the supposed intitution of marriage! Guess what? It's called progress, get used to it.	Gay marriage will change the institution.
0	These aren't the only two options available. The many philosophical views of the material world or ethics don't mean these two things don't exist.	This leads some into woolly New-Age-ist pick-and-mixing; others to conclude that the world's religions are all the product of a similar, purely mundane, process of cultural evolution, and that none actually reflects fundamental truths.
0	I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm asking if you'd think differently in that case, and you're not answering.	dreaming up imaginary what if situations doesnt prove anything,youve got nothing
0	Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.	This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart.

0	It isn't offered to make that assertion at all. It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price.	It seems to me the position of the woman is rather different in the two scenarios!I'm not saying abortion is always morally acceptable, not by a longshot.
0	i'm not 100% sure what set of facts you are working from, but they are not the correct ones i assure you. way more jewish people were killed than died in the iraq war. when you add everyone killed in wwii iraq is not even a comparison. let me make it clear, i'm debating the lesser of two evils here, (speaking of the war, i'm not for the assassination of bush. you can't kill someone for being an idiot, if so kill everyone who elected him, not just him... which would be more people than wwii and iraq war combined by the way)... where was i? oh yeah, there's no comparison. it's an evil (though crazy) ass who caused millions upon millions to die, vs. spoiled governor's son way too dumb for his position listening to douchebags like dick.	killing bush, however, will save many iraqis and preserve the american economy and kill off a major terrorist.

I don't expect that kind of consistency...	It takes a hypocrite to cite the huffington post and then complain about a news source.

1	which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie.	frank caliente doing his john madden imitation 'here's a guy who knows so much about so little he can judge the ethics of somebody who actually has ethics, while having no ethics of his own!
0	So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.	You might as well be citing yourself!Even one of the biggest advocates of the post-Dunblane handgun ban admitted that the ban was a huge failure, because even school children were able to get access to guns and kill their classmates.Don't you ever spread this lie again, we know that there's no ounce of truth to it!
0	As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity.	No, faith and reason are mutually exclusive.

0	So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?	I'm glad you made the same correlation I did.
0	Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a "link," whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!	It was an interesting creature, but simply having features present from two different forms (bird and dinosaur) doesn't mean it is a link?

0	Nope. Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step, making entirely new genes. Often, this is disastrous, but sometimes, a useful new enzyme results.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.	That is what one would expect to find.
0	Mach, your ability to make the wrong argument on the wrong post continues. I ask a question of this person, you reply not to them, but to me, and with ad hominem, and a 'just-so' statement.	Ironic, since your "Out of China" post was basically the same as this post.You even claim you had no debate point, you were just posting "information".
0	That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists. And that is what I was getting at originaly. Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid.	The agnostic position is obviously tentative, however even though the atheist does not explicitly state his position is tentative, you will be hard pressed to find an atheist who states "there is absolutely, positively, with out a doubt, no god at all".
0	Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.	There is no reason why it should remain illegal.I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed.

0	That is what supersport is hoping to do... However, assuming that you are correct in your interpretation, he has no chance of doing it so well.	Pointing out that an XXX is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless.
0	that's an interesting observation. by what means are you reasonably sure? do you think the other religions have the same take on it as you do? i used to think the same: if there is only one god, then they had to be worshipping the same, just giving him different names. then i was introduced to matt.7. clearly god only wants identifying (ex.6:3, 15:3 etc.) and worshipping one way, therefore all other religions have to be wrong. just a thought.	even if we just take the abrahamic religions we're still looking at about 2/3 of the world's population.

0	wikipedia is really quite amazing actually. you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it. that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors. but, there are millions of contributors. each going over and correcting information supplied by others. in my mind (given the current number of users) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information.	are you telling me that tiktaalik fossils, archeopteryx fossils and platypus don't exist, and that using wikipedia is somehow misleading in this sense?
1	NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!	Should gun registration be mandatory ?
0	you want sources saying that bo had 2 communist parents? voted to the left of socialist sanders?? is loved by cpusa was mentored by rev. wright and frank marshall davis?? supports single payer??? tell us which is propaganda???	otherwise, you would have listed the sources, for me to shoot down.

0	i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human. then why do we stop at a fertilized egg? if you mean potential, is supposed to become, or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being. if we say based on results then killing is killing. the reasons are irrelevant, there is no difference between abortion, capital punishment or self defense.  yes these are extreme, but its where your position leads. at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far, but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another.	look, i lost my response; i'm not going to retype it because in hindsight i was just repeating the same thing: you and i both know the issue is the morality of the act, choice is meaningless because all the law is, is the use of force to prevent (or prevent further) immoral choices.
0	No, everyone should have those regardless of marriage. You're the one here who seems to think straight and gay marriage should be a litmus test for those things.	I guess those are all "straight things" too?

0	And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy, the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller. Doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold.	If you're small then you can have a smaller brain,this contradicts evolutionists' position.
1	You're right, why not simply kill these people in the shortest amount of time possible. I got it! We can advertise each killing (hanging, rock slaying, Guillotine, etc.) weeks in advance, kinda like moves, and show it on pay-per-view. You can buy tickets to watch the show live as well. I mean c'mon, if we're going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome, cost efficient, and swift method possible. Right? That is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago.   Honestly, how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders. In regards to the death penalty debate, it falls along a continuum between morality and scientific reasoning.	but short of the death sentance, then yes, life without parole should be hard and no fun whatsoever, and i mean ever.
1	I agree, it is pure genius...especially how it has infiltrated politics and governments. emoticonXBanghead	Its pretty clear that the attributes of God were made up along the way over the course of history, for different motivations from explaining disasters and natural phenomenon, to comforting greiving loved ones, to controlling the masses and justifying the whims of the rulers.

0	That who knows? Your use of "we" does not include many religious folk I assume. I would claim to know of much interaction that God has and has had with the world.	What we are left with are gods that have considerably little interaction with the world that we know.

1	i'm always astonished that creationists try the 'lots of cultures have stories about floods' gambit.  yes, lots of cultures have stories about many things. either there was one great flood at one time, or there have been individual floods. since humans tend to congregate in river valleys, i think i know why all the flood stories contradict each other...	through the power of god, the animals all came themselves, and lined up ready for the ride, haven't you seen the movie?!
1	Go ahead and toss your Bible in the trash so you can justify your gay sex sin. See if that gets you into heaven.	Just because it is in the bible dosen't make it Gods word.
1	which leaves us with? if you said 'an appeal to majority' you win teh prize! you're not really leaving it to them when you're talking about enacting legislation based on a theory which is still under debate. most doctors won't prescribe marijuana in this country either. i guess we should just leave that to them though, since they're more qualified.	but when i think of all the climate scientists in the world, there must be tens or hundreds of thousands on the other side of the debate.

1	So, it's a proven fact that children denied the act of abortion suffer negative effects? Hmmmmmm	However, long-lasting, negative effects on both mothers and their children are reported where abortion has been denied.
1	wrong again daewoo; but at least you are painfully consistent. i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth. but then, who would ever accuse you of getting anything right? once again, the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been, more so than even carter.  i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point.  it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise.  so were you born this clueless, or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless?	so, in one thread you are whining because he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, but in this thread you are gloating because the legislation he suggested to fix that got shot down?
1	Really? What book is that, because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page. So once again accipiter, what in the world are you referring to? You and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with.   Here's my original post again, I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs, from skeletal remains?

0	How do you know there isn't a tiger in the bathroom? You feel very strongly and have over-whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom? (You live in an urban area, there are no zoos, you don't hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle, and the water is going) But you cannot prove a negative. Which is also why you won't be able to prove that creationism is wrong, and why we can't prove evolution is wrong. The focus must be on proving one right. How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought.	Certainly, if I said "there isn't a tiger in my bathroom", I wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see.

1	apparently you need to read up on up-to-date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics. that's right, and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well. so? i guess you'd also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it's born too, with that reasoning. there are many, many women in the pro-life movement. my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am. (trust me, you don't want to be in a room with her after you've killed a baby!) if you think this is a men versus women issue, you are sadly mistaken.	it is selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life.
0	Your statment is like saying we evented 2+2= 4. We did not envent it, it aways existed. Same with logic, its a concept that exists apart from the meterial universe. But in the atheists worldview, only the meterial universe exists.	Guess what, they weren't Christians.
1	Oh, really?   Translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to.	The fact that freedom of speech is still valid has nothing to do with this - the constitution doesn't rise and fall as one, or the concept of 'amendments' would not exist.
0	That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X.	In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.
0	You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons?How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others. Before you respons think about it. Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment? Lots of cannons? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly.	Doesn't mean it will stand up in court.The first portion, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State," is a qualifier to what follows "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
1	wow, i don't understand how this keeps happening. i'll try to switch mice.	so you are saying we should try and forget about it?
0	Just how do you suppose the government seeking permision would work in reality? And what exactly are you afraid of? It seems odd when people advocate blind trust for Joe Civilian, but then think that the government shouldn't be allowed to be armed. I think there must be a balance in trust given both ways.	Afterwards they can just turn them in and go back to being in their proper place.
0	What's "cumulative selection?" Do you mean a series of mutations with small but beneficial influence that occur over the period of thousands or millions of years? Just how do you propose to observe such mutations? In fact, we can observe such mutations by comparing the genomes of related species.	...yet the types of mutations that are required for cumulative selection have never been observed.
1	Doesn't surprise me lets all jump ship and put our heads in the sand... Even more of a reason I should run for public office :p	The reason simones threads turn to Yobama is because she is attacking Rick Warren as if he is responsible for anything the Ugandan Government does.
1	You do that, and be sure to use it when I repeatedly and ignorantly claim that the unborn are parasites while refusing to actually prove it as ingus has done here. Unless you too are making that claim also, then I would make the same challenge to you.	I am book-marking this to remind Archie on necessary future occasions...
0	Actually, if you count the Kinsey 4,5, and 6's you get 18%. It's 10% for the 5s and 6s. That'd be the people that prefer the same sex over opposite for the most part. 2,3,and 4 would be those who are bi and lean slightly one way or the other. 0 and 1 are people who pretty much always choose opposite sex over same. 0 and 6 are very rare though. Anyway, 10% of people are a 5 or 6. About 3% are a full 6.Could Jesus have been asexual? In certain philosophies asexuality is considered a sign of enlightenment. For instance, after becoming enlightened, the Buddha rejected sexual desires.	Nice try, but the target is 8' to the right.
0	well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer.	the only reason that it will be a mac is because of the information that is still inside of the computer that should be removed if you want to take the whole brain.

0	that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  lol, it's not like i care that much for this debate, but i will take that into consideration :) i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course. thank you, and of course. i'd love to debate with you.	i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure.
0	Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? Where do they get that power Constitutionally? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally. I think that marriage is a church issue. Let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. But leave marriage to the churches.	Marriage has become a state institution as much as a religious one, and I see no practical way to undo that at this point.
0	The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life.	But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry.
1	'blah blah blah'? look, you weighed in here on what i said, making an issue of whether it was internal, empatically making a point that it was action. as i said, i'm basically agreeing with you on the whole thing here about there needing to be equality in this situation, so i don't know why you're being so eager to find something to disagree over here.	you may find that some people find that preference a reason to question your commitment to gay rights.
1	I already have, hence the explanation I provided. If you challenge me to show you an error then I will. Did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if I could convince you it wasn't? When you post your evidence it usually has holes in it, not always but the truth is funny that way. It is very difficult sometimes to cover it up.And stay away from those shrimp, eagles, gays and snowmenThey are all abominations.	I'm not busting my butt for a certified Christ-denier who never admits anything when information is provided.
0	That and VOR keeps flip flopping on his positions and he refuses to clarify his contridictions.	Well you never know cause your pro life and for the death penalty.
1	WOW and the republicans would never do anything like that now would they.......They would never impeach a president over a BJ now would they?	With an election looming, the Dems will carry this beyond the limit of sensible investigation.
1	agreed, and they are really grasping at straws now. i'm surprised that anyone still takes kennedy seriously. emoticonxrolleyes	the democrats are going to do anything they can to bring down the gop..this is just another 'thing' to bring up to show how 'stupid' america is for putting them in power.
0	Well said.   With this religion, the gap is very wide between the "average guy" and "authority", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government.	But evolutionists are just as religious as Christians: they have their own unseen miracles – (random mutations)….their own clergy (scientists)…their own Bible (The Origin of Species)....and their own god (Natural Selection).
0	So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. You just want it used judiciously? Same here. Where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously.	Same with the others, if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine.
0	:d i love how no matter what we're talking about on createdebate, politics, and usually fox news, inevitably comes up. haha.	people undergo mass hysteria much to easy, which is one reason why i don't like the news, especially fox news.
0	i'm not incredulous because miller isn't here, i'm incredulous that not a single one of the 'millions of other religious evolutionists' are here.	your only evidence has been nothing more than personal increduality.
1	...Because everyone knows there are no married men sexually abusing children. emoticonXConfused	Perhaps if they did allow priests to marry, they wouldn't be sexually abusing the children they are suppose to teach.
1	Good point. emoticonXAgreeemoticonXAgree The poor guy would be like a midget that got his stepladder taken from him!	let him alone with his beliefs which he needs as badly as a man with broken legs needs crutches to move along.Without his beliefs poor Archie can not face life and even less death.So, of course he gets enraged when someone tries to take his carapace from him.
1	Na. Probably from smokin the Bovine Excrement they are trying to pedal! emoticonXSmilie	Maybe its from drinking out of the Cuyahoga.
0	How does this have anything to do with marriage? Reproduction occurs outside of marriage and has done so long before man became civilized.   Permitting only gay marriages won't decrease numbers. Increased family planning and birth control will.	One of the fundamental purpose of the union of a man and a woman is to create progeny.
1	Unfortunately for you, that is not shown, the evidence points in one direction, and one direction only. That of evolution and to the fact that the flood never happened.	What is shown very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence is that there are two ways to interpret it.
1	No, not at all. Read the post above. 'Christmas cracker'?? What's that? Here, we have Fortune cookies.:)	In other words..live life for today because you are a long time dead..or some other saying that you mind find in a Christmas cracker.The Chinese were bloody long windedemoticonXDonno

0	So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone. Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller. You brought up KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy) and you weren't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1" tall? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans?	The reality is erectus skulls are smaller because the people were SMALL -- like 5.0 - 5'5 tall, XXXXX.

0	how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?	i can't tell that since you ripped my answer out of its context.
0	To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more "preposterous".	To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
0	Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?Genesis says that all creatures were specially created. It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.Statis is the norm not the exception.One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?	If you think evolution cannot explain any change then why pick the avian lung in particular?
1	Quite amusing that you refer to westerners as Gringos. The last time I heard that was in a film about Pancho villa!	whatever 'rubber' was being exported probably ceased to be exported because of ravages of war during and after.Did you see any spike in the price of tyres, sorry 'tires' in the good old USA because of the Vietnam war ?natural rubber by the way is used mostly in big huge tyres not the size used in automobiles.Iraq was invaded to satisfy greed and ideology.
0	I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard.	The question here is wether or not you think hunting is a valid reason for gun ownership.
0	I have posted responses to Demon38's earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light.	If we are to give Christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidates, can you HONESTLY tell me that creationsim is the best answer?

0	At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to XXXX you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?	Two gun deaths per 100,000 population per year instead of fourteen?

1	according to what you mentioned previously, you violated the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and came out of the closet, disrupting your unit. real classy, jazy. your gay sex sin took preference over honorable service. but then that's your idol, so i'm not surprised.	i served in the united states navy from june 2006 to august 2008 and yet you still crucify me and others just like me because your religion and bitterness toward others has consumed you....
0	How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by "less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.	If we try to weed out the irresponsible ones, the poorer and less fortunate ones will get punished.
0	i'm very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees.	it sounds like at least some religious organizations recognize the impact of their not paying taxes upon others, and take the responsible route to ensure that they as employers do right by their employees (e.g.

Obviously, using the second amendment to oppose laws regulating such weapons is highly questionably."

0	And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it.	Therefore no law should ever be passed.
0	i'm surprised that some people still aren't aware of what the chinese have done to upgrade their country. sure, certain areas like the financial sector are still lagging (which is why they won't float the yuan just yet), but when it comes to industry and infrastructure they're done a most admirable job. does anybody here also think it's kinda funny that a communist country is beating the us at their own game (i.e. capitalism)?	what we do manufacture is so out of line with labor/compliance costs to be totally uncompetitive even if the chinese doubled their prices.
1	well, i am not surprised you think science is a cult. i guess you think everything you don't understand is a cult. emoticonxrolleyes	when i don't address it.
0	There's nothing to help, because what you said has no resemblance to reality.If someone is a junkie, they might also smoke pot, or if someone is a crackhead, they might also smoke pot, but the large majority of pot smokers DO NOT do heroin or smoke crack.	I dunno, but probably cause many other problems without everyone legalizing it.
0	there is plenty of evidence on what kind of marriage the clintons have. i am not making this up out of whole cloth, i am referring to the jr. senator's own words in her memoir 'living history': hillary rodham clinton felt 'dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged' when she learned of the affair and said that she could 'hardly breathe' when she learned the rumors of the affair were true. 'gulping for air, i started crying and yelling at him: 'what do you mean? why did you lie to me?' mrs clinton writes.  doesn't sound like such a swingin good time ey what? but don't take my word for it, go down to the library and read pg 502.  i stand by my previous thesis.	yet you have no idea what kind of marriage bill and hillary have.
1	And how is that? Your stereotypical view is supposed to represent "truth"?? LMAO. B**** (and I mean that "lovingly") I'm friggin married. For 10 years. I don't accept "gay sex proposals", unless it's from my husband. And he ain't "white". I had my flings with y'all....and y'all ain't right. I moved on. And learn to use English "correctly". A remedial English course is recommended. And I have never lived in Sodom. I'm a Houstonian. B^^^^.	You would if it involved a gay sex proposal.
1	Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics. Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number. I am sure that IRS, GOD, and Hovind can work it all out.	The big bang theory may not be the last word from science on cosmology, by I can't see a no-good, talentless hack like Hovind, or any other professional Creationist crank, providing us with any insights into it.
1	Then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? Silly, I 'd say! Humans are part of the animal kingdom. Mammals if I remember from biology. Are you not an animal?

For me the reason I don't "give it credit" is that it's irrelevant--I don't see how it matter either way way if sexual "orientation" is natural or not.

0	Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?	If a pregnant woman was denied Vitamin C - well, it hardly bears thinking about, but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it, too, was denied Vitamin C.Now, if the baby was born with a functional Vitamin C synthesising gene, that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes.

1	It is supported, I have shown that it is true. Your only argument is to claim that organisations that perpetrate genocide don't agree that it is genocide. Wow what an argument you have.	That is part of what we are debating in the abortion debate.However, unlike the term person or the ideas about when rights begin, the term genocide is NOT a matter of opinion and it DOES have a very specific DEFINITIVE meaning, as defined in the definitions posted over the last few pages.

0	Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.(Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)	I suppose the correct terminology would be that G. fortis evolved a smaller beak due to competition from a larger billed recent imigrant.I suppose that we just aren't subjected to the same word selection pressures this side of the Atlantic.emoticonXHoho
1	So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them?

My friends who were with me did not see him, but I am not suprised they were engrossed in their conversation, I left their side and they did not realise I had left.

1	sorry your mightiness, thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk.  are you really that obtuse? i swear you and easy share a brain. i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority. personally, i think this applies to single parents, families with 2 daddies, or children raised in an orphanage.  yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children, they are taught some form of respect for authority.  how so? i didn't write it, i'm just commenting on it. and again, i prefer to replace 'mother and father' with authority. regardless, who says respect = fear? maybe you and easy really do share a brain...you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments.	this doesnt really add up to anything more than your musings so i will take up one point.

0	Actually, that's not true. While all of the sciences actually support one another, one can be a chemist and not accept evolution. One can even do good science without accepting evolution, but it is difficult. For example, cosmology, astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe. That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution.	If somebody is not an evolutionist to you he/she is not "really" ascientist is he?
0	okay, my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion; but, here is my opinion anyway. one reason there are so many crimes against women, or crimes in general, is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time. how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses. i don't know what the answer is --but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes, especially sex crimes.	i have had to really change my point of view of how people (male and female) look at life lately, greg.
0	You got it. People make mistakes. Finally you see that scientists are just as human as religious people.	Is that why there are tens of thousands of "Christian" religions?
0	I know what you mean. You should see some of the other "books" he has at his site as well.Well, now we know that Muslim creationists are even nuttier than Christian creationists, but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo-science of creationism (Read: Religious beliefs). ;)	I read the first chapter, here's some good excerpts.It's helpful if one understands evolution before one attempts to debunk it.That's just a blatant lie.
0	And here we have a leading YEC showing how he starts with his preexisting religious position and is not about to change it, no matter what the scientific evidences show.	We do not know how the Creator created, what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe.

If the Irish people hadn't kept their arms and kicked you tyrannical control freaks out of their country, you people would have slaughtered them wholesale and Ireland would be part of your bloody empire.
0	I think perhaps you're confused.1. I know of no meaningful definion of the term "god' as it pertains to reality.2. When you mention science and history, that implies you are interested in reality.3. There is no evidence to support mythological deities, god or God or Odin or the easter bunny.* So, yes THERE IS NO EVIDENCE of the existence of any mytholgoical gods.** Yes, there is no evidence that the universe was created, or if that statement even has meaning if the universe always was, and always will be.p.s. There is easter bunny.-Mach	Do sufficient science and history in its total amount to enough evidence to conclusively disprove the existence of God?

0	The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago.

1	I think it would be best for neither one to have a gun, as there would be no chance of me getting hurt. After all, I could beat up a guy armed with a plastic fork. However, if the hijacker has a gun, I'd like someone (not me, I'm half blind in each eye, I'd probably hit a passanger or something) to have a gun.	Or would otherwise it result in a duel with plastic forks and the purple thing left over from lunch?Trouble is this question leads to the next one- would you prefer to possibly have a passanger with a gun, a the hijacker almost certainly with one.
1	Actually no. You read the article again, and thoroughly this time.	I read the essay.
1	The judge should be informed that 'the leading' IDist admits that ID is religion. (yes, I've posted this before...)

So Dembski's ID has one or more unspecified deities - supernatural, unembodied designers - creating biological systems, at some unknown time, at some unknown place, by some unknown series of steps. What a great scientific theory! :-)	Do you think that the judge will be able to totally dismiss in his mind that this group mission is to push a religious agenda?

1	Wouldn't professing atheism cover that?Or were you looking for something else? I'll call mine "Bertrand".	I have met professed atheists who could not put a name to their actual beliefs.
0	Well said. Most Americans favor more gun control, but unfortunately this majority of Americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue. This is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control. There probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but I'm not sure how much this will change things.	The reason the dems wimp out is because the gun nuts votes are likely to be swayed by a candidate's position on gun control, whereas non gun nuts, while having an opinion, are most likely concerned about other issues.

0	To you, it may be an incorrect statement. But if it is, you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote. Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference. Injustice is still practiced there, and not even some abortion doctors realize it.	Viability seems to be the topic that gets little mention here.
0	That is not quite what the 'mitochondrial Eve' hypothesis posits.Science. 1995 Dec 22;270(5244):1930-6. The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the "mitochondrial Eve" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies.	Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial "Eve", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.

0	But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on.	Fire and tool use means that having a big brain becomes less of a disadvantage and more of an advantage now that you can feed it yea but you have to have the brains to build a fire before it becomes an advantage.

0	I think you got it backwards Kelvin. You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.   And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow.	in great britain the police have been arresting children for playing with toy guns.

In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling.

0	You say that alot but discussion is about taking other people seriously.	Second, your assertion that we should stop menopause is also patently absurd!
0	I'm not moving the goal posts, this is just your attempt at intellectual dishonesty. Heller was about an individual right protected in the Constitution, Dred Scott wasn't. Therefore these two cases aren't comparable anymore than cotton candy and scrap metal.	My point was that the Supreme Court has been wrong before so assuming that the Supreme Court is always correct about an issue is unjustified.
1	Aaahhh, so just not accomplishing our goals and going home is not defeat, there has to be paperwork for it to be a defeat. Gotcha.	Choosing defeat would be surrender.
1	Because their reasoning is obviously on the same level as their reading comprehension level.	Well, as we can see from other recent posts, your reading comprehension is below high school level.I don't get it.
0	This is not true. Rather, when there is conflict between one's sanctity of life vs another's quality of life, the sanctity of life must win.	In affirming the absolute sanctity of life, we deny the sanctity of particular lives by putting them at the disposal of others - in the case of abortion, affirming the absolute sanctity of the baby's life involuntarily subordinates the mother to the child.
1	Thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like KFC to me.	Because if it's a chicken egg, and if it's allowed to incubate to term, it sure isn't going to be a crow when it hatches.
0	I think hip hop and the arts are reflections of society. It is good to bring these issues to light, if only so that those who wouldn't normally be aware of them are enlightened.	Ludacris and many others in the hip hop scene disrespect women with their lyrics and videos.
1	he screamed and insulted and threw his literature at the vice president of pride. and you once again snipet and reword my posts by taking them out of context to serve your own irrational and bigoted thought process. oh and dont accuse your community? what are you some holy leader? get off of your self rightous high horse and get a clue! and how is my community rising above your 'communities' bigotry and and slander? by having pride movements like these and standing up for ourselves.	don't you dare ever accuse my community of being intolerant or bigoted until your community rises above it.
1	be homophobic... like the naacp? oh wait, they're left wing. call for war... like the democrats for vietnam? oh wait, they're left wing. be racist... like claim that minorities can't help themselves? oh wait, that's also left wing. sir... you've engaged in stereotyping... that makes you... hmm.	i place rw extremos higher than lw ones because they are more likely to call for war, be racist and be homophobic.
1	What's the matter? Can't anybody in KC afford to have 2 cars? emoticonXWow	I voted No, cars are for transportation only, only because it was the only "no" option.
0	well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice.	there are gays that go to my gym, am i being homophobic if i purposely avoid showering with him?
0	I think the energy( essence of the human life) always was	for instance, can life be defined as energy?if so, then birth becomes as much of an enigma as death; is energy created too?
0	Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it.	The key difference is that these countries do a much better job than we do of keeping guns out of the wrong hands.
0	you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india.	in particular, the government may not take any action whos primary effect is to advance or endorse religion and 'the constitution forbids not only state practices that 'aid one religion...or prefer one religion over another,' but also those practices that 'aid all religions' and thus endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion'.
0	They can "marry" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.	So what rational reason would there be to deny them the right to marry the person they love?
0	Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram. I think that you'll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much.	Why, if one wants to have an abortion, should one be FORCED to view a sonogram?
1	Yeah, but now the special interests won't have access to congress' deep pockets emoticonXRolleyes (hopefully)	Personally, I'd like to see Congress take an extended vacation and only work part-time as our forefathers envisioned.
1	Might as well attribute intelligence to your thermostat as rape seed plants.	A chemical reaction in response to an environmental change in condition is not a 'mind'.
0	Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.	to become the nations next biggest idiot?
1	This should be in the science section, not the CvE section. Don't give SS any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology.	I've always been fascinated with the big bang, and we may finally start to understand much more about it and how it happened.Thoughts?
0	Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates. It's my personal favourite - but what do you think?	This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist.
0	They do not. They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible. Feathers also offer increased protection from attack. They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers. They absorb and spread impact quite well.Feathers don't itch and they don't rustle in the bush.Do you have an answers that aren't examples of shallow thinking?	They offer reduced protection.
1	Unriggable, your statement should read the so-called "pro-life" since they are anything but.	Pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.Or am I missing something?
0	we are not talking about genesis as a story are we? we are talking about bilbical creation. you really are thick arent you? i know there are religious people, deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread. undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it. certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved. the horse evolution thread was fine...you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. now show exactly how life originated and you're home and dry.	you see, this is talking about 'biblical creation'... you know, taking genesis literally, and all that type of nonsense.
0	dear thetruth, i have posted it as a serious topic. and of course it is meant to get people talking, thinking and arguing. if you were watching/listening to the trump press conference that obama brink into the middle of (beceause he was getting slaughtered), you would take this seriously. btw, on may 23rd (the day after he finisheds the last apprentice show), we can expect some announcement! what it will be i don't know, but i bet it will be trump confirming he will run for president. andy	if you post this for fun, i understand but if you post this as a serious topic, then this is stupid.
0	And evolution is exhausted. It can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more.	True, but it does make evolution a known factor, and the scientific method requires that one prioritise exhausting the explicative power of known factors before inventing new ones.
0	Actually, I meant the behaviour refered to in her post was interesting.	As Mr. Jack said, interesting.
0	i'm surprised homeland security can't have gun's in dc banned. it's a federal designation, is it not?	wonder when d.c. is going to run out of money trying to defend the indefensible??
1	It probably was a bunny suit that he was supposed to wear. I guess he changed his mind, once again, and decided to wear this suit.	could a picture of kerry in a bunny suit (even if it was a real bunny suit) really sway voters?
0	But the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself. Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying'God must exist, because God is good and would not allow a world without God'.	It has gotten us far and will continue to (as long as we don't destroy ourselves in misusing that knowledge).
0	what do you find disrespectful about it? maybe it is 'disrespectful' but i sometimes that's not necessarily so bad. i don't think it rises to the level of being offensive.	you don't actually think that anyone who supports gay rights in any way could find that piece anything but disrespectful, do you?
0	i totally agree. you never know what you might pick up. but he likes to eat hey? that's weird. but to each his own. i like to eat more normal food myself. but if you explore certain sides of someones personality, do you really learn anything? how do you know you just don't watch and then five minutest after you explore the personality, you forgot everything about that person. i mean, i don't know, but i have some trouble picking up on personalities right away of people i meet. has anyone ever tried spilling tuna on the floor on purpose? i'm just wondering because that would be weird.	i guess its ok to explore certain sides of your personality, and its always good to get out and meet new people and try new things.

1	Just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.	those kind of websites are like porn to gun nutsbut getting big gun wont compensate for being born with a small one
0	Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results.	Indeed, for several decades, molecular evolutionists have relied on an evolutionary view that abandons the Darwinian presumption of abundant pre-existing variation, assuming instead that the rate of evolution depends directly on the rate of introduction of new alleles by mutation.
1	No, they don't. Creationists do. "Why haven't all animals turned into humans?"	Evolutionists may talk of actual selection as if it had a mind of its own and does the work of evolution on purpose
0	You could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out.	-If you say you don't want the unborn to "live off you" anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now.-You have decided the stranger must go, however, you don't have a right to kill him right there as you didn't give him any reasonable time to leave.
1	Pure conjecture on your part. As a father of three, I have as much vested interest in my kids as my wife has. To suggest otherwise is BS. But, maybe you don't understand that because you haven't walked a mile in a father's shoes. emoticonXRolleyes	Of course men can, do, and should have opinions and feelings about abortion, but to say that your interest is equal to that as a woman is silly.
1	The Fact that you believe there is some sort of salvation in Jebus proves you are the dumb one.. You should stop rejecting reality ....	Dawkins is probably in Hell right now wishing he wasn't so dumb in rejecting Christ's salvation.
1	This just goes to prove that these nasty gays are maliciously infiltrating the military far more than we suspected (anyone would think they want to defend the country or something).

Quick, club the lot of them before this thing spreads.emoticonXRolleyes   Er . . . *puts down burning cross and slinks into shadow*	There have been significant outbreaks in the SEAL training school in San Diego, as well as the Marine Recruit Training Depot, but this has not made the news.

1	Hey Dane, you're real good at calling people ignorant, sanctimoniously declaring everything they say as false, blatantly false, or falsehoods. But would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts arguments with anything more than insults? Like some actual facts for example?	If your argument is based on outright falsehoods like you just did, then the output will be false as well.
0	how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act? i don't see what you're getting at.	during the clinton administration, reno's justice department and tennet's cia treated terrorism as a criminal act, which it is not.

0	I think your idea has merit. However, before I would fully endorse it, I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law.	The thing is, though, that if marriage is privatized people can have freedom without "redefining the standard."

1	So, some parts of the Bible are erroneous oral history after all! What a refreshing admission.	...and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah, in Oral history, so it would differ slightly, but that's becaue of man's error, not God's.
0	But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the "logical" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and "make sense" to more than one person, these specific "explanations" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.	Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith.
1	yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?	while you see the need to not only debate him on points, then post an expose about your ideas of his capability, i'm still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology.
1	Evidence? We're talking religion here. Religion. If there were evidence, then it would be science.	Is that a likely possiblity though?
1	You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:Question: Was Stalin a communist ?Answer: That's what he said he was.Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.	So Stalin didn't actually practice Communism (not that anyone has), but really just used bits and pieces to further his rule and such ideology is not communism but Stalinism.
1	pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ? your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.My advice to you ?keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.	My age is irrelevant to the fact that I simply know more than you can comprehend.
1	What, pray, is a real answer? Because, you know, if it is anything like a corrcect answer you are doing a rather poor job of it, mate.	The Creation Museum, like Creation magazine, the radio program Answers … with Ken Ham, and the other outreaches of Answers in Genesis, is dedicated to giving people real answers about the scientific, religious, philosophical and ethical debates of our day.
1	archie, it's already 'cleared up' that you're a liar. you claimed to know what he was about. you claimed it was a 'secular site that's dedicated to exposing the homosexual, extreme left, communist and anarchist agenda'. but he's not really interested in 'homosexuality' at all. and i find you're 'couldn't find it' to be incredibly absurd. it's on the web-page where he talks about the event in the first place. if you actually start clicking to see the pics and his comments, it's right there! i'm not linking to pornographic material on this web-site. the header of that web-page reads:  'up your alley fair san francisco, july 27, 2008 part 1' i am incredibly amused that you repeatedly lie all over the place on this web-site, but then you press others for proof.	as i said above, would you care to link to the description section where it say's this, because i couldn't find it.

0	BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry. Any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed.	It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.
0	Well let's deal with one thing at a time. The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. The study didn't conclude that it was just a "curious relationship in the numbers." Go back to that thread and read the study. If you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. You can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.	From my memory your medical references both showed the trend you state, but they were also limited in geography and sample (two cities), and provided no casue and effect, merely a curious relationship in the numbers.
1	what other forest? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world, and it would be what, the size on central park?	Like I said in #2, most of the earth's oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and we still have al the other forest.

0	are you saying you only have a hard time having compassion for the gay victims of sexually transmitted illness? if, so that just shows your anti-gay prejudice. what difference does that make? everyone who has aids is a victim. in some communities and in other countries, the majority who have it are straight. against the victims from the largest social group of victims in each jurisdiction? this is nothing more than prejudice and destructive political agenda.  i would hope there are other, better, human instincts inside of you.	i am sorry but i have a hard time having compassion for gays thay engage in anal intercourse and fail to use protection........that is how most cases of aids are passed in this country.... that is just me though..........

0	if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. based on results paul had more influence. how can you simply ignore the obvious? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it's unwillingness to concede that sometimes it's wrong. how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn't flat.  instead they either ignore the issue, bury it through violence or intimidation, or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right.	peter was obviously there are more writings of peter apart from the gospel of mark and 1 & 2 peter you find in the bible.... you will discover it is not only the bible that the church use for their deposit of faith but a number of other writings regarded as sacred tradition.

0	Well let's put it this way. I really like playing baseball. So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they're in a position where it will threaten their life.

0	do you have any evidence of this that doean't come from a biased christian website? so here is where you are saying nanny, nannie, poo,poo my straight realtionship is better than your gay relationship. how? some big claims, can you provide some substance to them, in other words can you back this up with some data? that doesn't come from some christian baised study.	it would convey the false message that whatever private sexual relationships adults choose deserve the same legal treatment as traditional marriages.
0	And what would make them separate species? How about wolves and dogs, separate species? How about Great Danes and Chihuahuas?

Socialism, communism and capitalism aren't the only choices for how to organize an economy.Also, the US at present is neither "pure capitalist" nor socialist.
0	I think a more telling question would be, why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe? It seems completely idiotic to me.

1	Abstinence until heterosexual marriage isn't encouraging heterosexual marriage?  I've never heard of an abstinence-until-domestic-partnership program. Perhaps you could point us to an inclusive abstinence-only program somewhere.  Perhaps not....	regardless, there's no way anyone can argue that abstinence programs are about 'straight pride' or somehow about being straight, which was the context of the discussion when these examples came up.
1	they weren't interested, remember? so your god punishes children for not being a member of the right 'club'. your god sounds more and more like a monster every time you mention him. once again, like with archie i have been wrong to assume you a bigot, you're a xenophobe.	and if jito's gay friend is teaching the kid that gay sex is fine and is failing to lead the boy into the truth about jesus christ, then imo he isn't a positive role model.

1	And if the majority supported banning Christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? Civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.

0	Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.	Athiesim has no such standard, and I don't want to hear about relative "ethics" that mean nothing, or have no longevity, or change with the winds.
0	so wouldn't that cover almost all of africa? there are so many people dying in the city streets of hunger in our own country, yet we elect a president who wants to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves, we would be helping africa a lot more than we are now (their average life expectancy is like 30). yes iraq was terrible, but guess what, other countries might think our country is terrible. that is not our concern and at least we could wait until we fixed all of our own problems first. we have poor hungry starving people on the streets of the us and we go to another country to solve their problems?	like i said we cannot solve all the worlds problems, we just need to be there for others less fortunate than ourselves.

1	they sure do, and make sure that there are all those women priests and women cardinals that have a say in the politics of the church. when they sealed the room to choose this current pope, how many women were in that room? when they were discussing the publication of the last catchiesm, how many women participated? it's easy to pray to a non-corporial image, because that image won't talk back and heavens forbid, give an opinion.	catholics say prayers to a woman that they hate.
0	i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp	he was a terrorist in jordan before he moved to iraq, and there are still numerous al qaeda training camps in jordan that we have not addressed anyway, you have been asked to show that iraq has a single al qaeda terrorist camp which is protected or acquiesed by iraq

1	I'm sure it is many a doctors' spiritual duty to relieve suffering, just as Jesus healed the sick.   Besides, who wants to go back to 40 year average lifespan, like they have in Afghanistan? Not me.	It is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul, not how many years you can stay on the earth.
1	So, I'm wondering, did you neglect to note the reason because you "forgot" or because it would weaken your statement and its connotation that we really didn't want him that badly? emoticonXConfused	That agreement specified that no member of the Palestine Liberation Organization will be arrested or brought to court for any action that happened prior to September 13, 1993, the day the Oslo accord was signed, Erakat said.
1	But that is how creationism works - half truth. Evolution is a theory but don't make it quite clear that in science the word theory doesn't mean half-assed guess, as it does in creationism. Check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the Patterns of Cumulative Change paragraph on page 7. That is pure YEC. And you aren't a YEC?	Personally, I see no problem with this, as long as they stick to the facts in any case.

0	but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo. An argument made for slavery was that "you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do"..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned.	First of all, i can turn around right here, because i can see that you already have no idea what you are talking about.
0	you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them.	i'm not an expert on pre-colonial india but i'm pretty certain it was not the primitive land you seem to think it was.

0	That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench.	For example, Scalia stated in Heller:"Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."
1	So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?	Biology is centered around the theory of evolution.
0	I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.	NOTE: When I say beneficial mutations, I am not talking about a gain of new genetic information to the genome.

0	I have heard that the USA spends around 40% (total) more on health care than Canada does. That would be impressive if it weren't for one fact. The USA has 900% of our population. It is your administration costs what are getting you the most. We only spend around 11% on administration while the USA spends around 25% of their health care dollars. We have a cap on how much a doctor can be sued for as well. Yes, our system isn't perfect, but it still works.Nearly 50 million Americans don't have health care at all, that is around 18% of your total population. This is quite shameful. As I've stated, the USA is the only Nation in the Industrialize world to not have universal health care.	I have my own idea for a healthcare plan... it's not at all universal, but it helps the people who need help without subjecting people to substandard care.
1	I know. Sad indeed. Orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas. As if Jesus (who is God according to Scripture) would come out and give Moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man. Get real. When the antichrist comes he'll probably be gay (one OT scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women, and Satan loves to mimic God's kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist.). Then Orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior.	First he (Orion) starts with a comedy website, but then he actually gets on this thread and starts asking questions positing "what if" Jesus was Gay?

1	Dude, my own father had hospice care in my home up until he died. I think I know a thing or two about it. None of what you say disproves that end-of-life can still be a scary thing. Maybe if you'd stop just being belligerent about it and actually thoughtfully discuss it, you might actually find some things I'm saying you find agreeable. (GASP!)	Do they have hospice care where you live?
1	That's quite a leap, even for you. How did you know that the officiers were pro-life? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance.

0	And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences.	HeheI can't tell a difference between my philosophy and science, it is all knowledge that is gained through non-contradictory inquiry into reality.

0	That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it.	In a few decades, it might be possible that technological progress would develop an "artificial womb" that can nurture a fetus almost from day one until birth.

0	Please define "climb upward" and "downhill slide" in biologically meaningful terms. Please define "degeneration."	Some evolutionists try to claim that life can indeed climb upward by saying that the organism can draw energy from its environment – which would enable it to defy the downhill slide of degneration [sic].
0	And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks, and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property.

0	falling, did i say that 'the church alone provides for the needy?' if i did please point it out to me. each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the federal government. the constitution gives certain delegated powers to the federal government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. socialism is merely the stepping stone into communism, and i don't want to see this nation start down that path. maybe i live by the constitution because it is 'the supreme law of the land.' the question is not why do i live by the constitution, but why don't you? until the constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and i plan to live by it.	here is a thread where we can go at each others throats, so-to-speak.

0	Depends on which cell you mean. Mammalian red blood cells, for example, have had their entire nuclei and mitochondria removed.

0	your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.	sometimes there can be an age gap of 5 years and it could still be consensual, so imo fine, but other times it could be 4 years age difference and not fine (eg, a 14 year old and a ten year old) i'm not really sure how that analogy is relevant.

0	for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?	no only does the experiences one has make that person, but so does their effect on others.
0	Evolution doesn't explain the event. The event is an example of evolution - a change in the frequency of alleles in a populatioin over time. The explanation may or may not be evolution by natural selection. You merely asserted that based on your imagined case.	Evolution is not needed to explain such an event, as natural selection clearly accounts for it.
1	Not only is Phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality. You were already called on using incorrect facts once...you might as well say "denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day"	no...As you say, I agree things need to be looked at on a case by case bases; thats what choice is unless there are criteria.
0	What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?	There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis.
0	i lived in sevilla for the better part of year. spaniards are extremely good at staying out of other people's business. smiling at a stranger on the bus is invasive. i am not surprised most spaniards support gay marriage - most likely because they would never assume it was any of their business.	spain is primarily a roman catholic country.......they will never let the socialists or the left allow gay marriage i nthat country........... you can take that to the bank
0	Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.	because you're right and they're wrong?
1	We came from apes not created. Why can't people figure that out did any body go to school around here.	which is, a nonsense question to put forward.You might be trying to invoke debate from Christians who take a non-literal Biblical approach, if this is what you desire, you have not put the question properly.
0	And people say I make strawman arguments.Simply put, not enough to justify your "concerns".	And how many people have got away with killing someone just for trespassing.
1	so much bs... where should i start? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations. since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations? if a woman wants to maximize her life, liberty, and happiness, and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy, your intended prevention of that action 'flies in the face of the declaration of independence'... (not that the declaration has any legal standing.) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant. no thing, human or not, has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter's consent. 'abortive technologies'? you sound like falwell, insisting that cloning destroys life when it does nothing of the sort. please explain your laughable statement.	rovdak, are you forgetting that ivf and cloning technologies are abortive technologies?
0	based on what? i never said mr. horn did anything legally wrong. he was well within the rights of the state of texas. i never argued otherwise. that doesn't change the obvious fact that he intended to kill the two men, which is the topic of the discussion at hand.	i'm beginning to not see much point in continuing this argument with you either, because you just can't seem to understand the fact that mr. horn wasn't found guilty of any wrongdoing.
1	you are attempting to trivialize the bias we who are gay, face, against our sexuality. you try to trivialize everything we have accomplished in terms of social acceptance, that heterosexuals have always taken for granted. your assinine comments show sensitivity to no one. maybe you'd like to start a pride movement for ignorant, insensitive, jackasses? society is moving so against that group right now.	unkerpaulie, you need to just accept that he's wired that way.

0	Ill be the first to agree with the saying "If you can...and have the place to...you will" But like anything else..you have to look at the better side of things...It would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed..yes perhaps what you said might take place..but the benefits would outway them..and thats all we can ask for in life.As for our irresponsable citizens...they are already armed.

0	I think it would be an exception as well.But if you see an indicator that might point to an "exception", I think the question should be asked.Consider the flip side of things. The question doesn't get asked.If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question.	But I really do believe that it's the definite exception rather than the rule, and personal ideology shouldn't be made part of something like a job interview.
0	This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism.	Yet, since only a small percentage of the earth's surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column, the claim of their having taken place to form a period of rock--life--time over the earth is therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking.
0	does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy? probably not. would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos (threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries) help the economy? certainly not. is rawls argument correct, and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals? no.	there is no indication that firms are actually competing for the top talent, they just seem to be cycling around the same faces and awarding themselves ever larger pay rises.

1	i have several that i want everyone who engages in the 'man caused global warming' debate to consider.... and i thank you for helping to illustrate some of those points for me (bold text above). asside from the points we've already discussed,... i am a bit intrigued by the fact that many of your ilk (concerned about saving the lives of millions by reversing or slowing the warming trends of the planet) are seemingly oblivious and uncaring about the millions who are deliberately killed in the name of 'choice.' isn't the decision to drive an suv a choice as well? emoticonxrolleyes	so i will ask yet again...do you have a point?
0	so God would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom. how very libertarian of you, jyoshu.but actually, are evil and freedom inversely proportionate? look at the examples i gave: slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom. on top of that, God puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things... not to mention the evil that he himself has done. murder, genocide, bigotry... the lot.if he made people with complete freedom, he MUST have made people with evil as well. why did he do that? the only reason i can come up with is that if God made everyone in his image, he himself must be evil, even partially. that that is apparent in the bible.	But don't blame God for all the evil in the world when you know one (evil) can't exist without the other (freedom).
1	And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.	Naturally, one can only observe what exists in the present.
0	Yes, it is interesting how we draw an arbitary "legal line in the sand" with regards to determining how late into a pregnancy an elective abortion is available.	I would love to see more discussion of views that are in between the two extremes of abortion illegal at all times, and abortion allowed at all times.
0	What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. For both the 'braniac" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.	In short, I think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact: a person who is brain-dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given, whereas an embryo who is "brain-dead" most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone.
0	This is a very simple, easily answerable question. Most people, especially in America, have problems with people telling them what to do. Teenagers hate being under the authority of adults. Adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law. Everyone in the world is under worldly authority, but to actually have a God who created you, which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not, that makes most people really XXXXXX off.	Not a problem in the practices of the church or the people, but in the being that we believe in.

1	your foot would do service as a colander. in australia, a weapon may be legally held for many reasons. self defence is not one of them. you might legally own a weapon for sport shooting, but use it to defend yourself. how hard is that to understand? for a supposed 'expert' not to realise that a drawn pistol is not pointing at ones foot, is a major error commonly made by fantasy gunners.	did i just see a draw pistol and shoot ones self in foot here?
1	yep. you got it.  i'm so busted.  seriously. you were a lot closer with the 'abusive participant' thing and i'm surprised that you (of all people) took the line that you did. cheap shots like that are not something that you are known for.	so if you were to make a valid point everybody would support it leaving him at a disadvantage.
1	Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.	and i quote: "so to answer your question: yes"damn im so evasive!since you asked the question again, ill answer again<snip>stuff about us being in a democratic system</snip>as a christian, if a legal matter is being contested, and you want to oppose it, you are certainly welcome to do so.

0	morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc).	that aside, where did god tell these folks to do what they did?

0	Yeah, it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells, but I think that if it comes out the way they hope, it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks. I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists. And yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about, claiming it is immoral (maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonXRolleyes ), but it will likely not have as many objections.	Amniocentesis, while pretty darn safe, is not without risk.First, the pregnant mother must donate the cells.The risk to the fetus is not zero.When we already have a zero risk procedure from cells that are going to be disposed of anyway.In any event, I am sure some nut job with an extremely skewed sense of morality will find a way to call this procedure immoral in some way.

I've asked repeatedly for an example of a mutation that beneficially alters phenotype and have yet to receive one.

1	So how are those gun free zones working out for you?	"Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment , nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.
0	I know what you meant.My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply "vote" it out of existence. No need for the courts at all.	I meant a decision that the majority of the population has made in regards to legislation.

If so, prove it rationally, by science.	To claim so is a contradiction, you cannot claim to know something of the unknowable.
0	That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.	this is not only because of its elusive nature to science, but also because of religious requirements.from a scientic perspective, nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law.

Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.   There are some who need to be put to death.   Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation.

0	backpedaling? how's that? my original answer is that it's wrong to force children to have sex with old men. that is my answer still. where has it changed? in fact, each post i've made is an affirmation of the one before it. how is that backpedaling? there are absolute goods and evils. that is, there are certain things that are good or bad. how is that saying something different? certain things are bad. period. just like certain things are wrong, no matter how many people think that they aren't wrong. period. is that clear enough for you? i hope so because that's what i've been saying all along and you'd have to be high to think i've changed my position.	penfold, now it is only 'certain' behaviours which are 'inherently' evil across all cultures and mores.
1	You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death.	If you want to press your argument further you will need to construct an argument as to why "putting someone in the position" obligates you to sustain their life, and when doing so you may want to examine the consequences of that position, to see if you can apply it consistently.You put it theretherefore you are responsible for itisn't, in itself, an argument.

0	Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion, as we all do. Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception. The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour. So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human' as and when it suits their purpose.Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like: some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human, then it IS. It isn't. It's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother. You can't deny that.Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue: in the meantime, the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body.	It's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus, which has a separate blood system, and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person...
1	well, it's nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive (rather than actually wanting to discuss it) to the request was indeed correct. can't say i'm surprised though. this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he'd find real disagreement (gasp!) for as long as i've known of him, usually choosing instead to throw his easy 'drive-by' insults from the peanut gallery. basically, he's a coward, and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll.	he's been doing it for almost a decade now, and none of us are fooled.

0	So for example if I say "you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are "a part" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.	You claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of “empirical fact”, this is just not so.

I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!	you yourself were once in exactly the same position and condition as an unborn child is now, and look at what you have become.
0	hun dont let no ones opinions bother you. no one matters but you, because your living your life and its your body. i personally think everyone shold hold off till 16 but im not going to insult you because thats just plain retarded. what gives you people the right to insult someone for asking a question? im not talking about freedom of speech im talking about being a nice person. nobody has manners anymore, i swear.	and you, phunting, need a thump on the head from my brolly!
0	so in what way are the sperm and egg not human pray tell? are your sperm/eggs from some other species? are they lizard life? elephant life? what kind of life do they have (and you admit they do) outside of human life? sorry but sperm and egg are human and they are alive, how can you deny both statuses? oh yes if both sperm and egg are living matter then the claim 'life begins at conception' is patently false. i will assume you modify that phrase now to be 'human life begins at conception' but that is also clearly false on the face of it.	at no time did i state the component parts of this seperate, human life, were dead.
1	oh yeah because someone else getting involved and helping them wage war on palestine for daring to live in their own country is really likely to prevent the war from escalating.	they need support from someone else before wwwiii is started.
1	I'm with Smiley: you're describing yourself perfectly, save for referring to conservatives instead of liberals.	lyteboy can raise any issue he likes, but God help the conservative for calling him on his blatant ignorance and bigotry against anything and anyone who dares disagree with his warped view of reality.
1	So, how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis? Talk about hypocrisy.	As far as the abortion issue goes there is no God that supports the murder of the innocent unborn in the womb........
0	Exactly and if you accept that animals have been on the Earth for millions of years then why can't evolution be a process that God created and controls?	How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time, as recorded by fossils?
1	Hey Jitobaby - if you're that insecure with your beliefs that you have to throw this kind of a snit when people are making a case contrary to your failed radical liberalism, then maybe you need to watch Michael Moore on TV instead of reading my posts.	Why do you want to cram it down other people's throats?
0	it's a pretty obvious counter question, i'm surprised it caught him so off guard. what's his name, if you don't mind my asking? i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district.	you make a great point, one i had brought up to my state senator as well.
1	Ah, historical inevitability. I had no idea you were a marxist, Steeeeve! Unfortunately for you the same argument applies to the collapse of capitalism. And once again you conflate capitalism and freedom. Have you never heard of anarcho-syndicalism? And why is someone more free when their life is controlled by corporations than when those corporations are restrained by a democratic government?	These countries haven't been around that long remember (in terms of the type of government).
1	Hey that would be great. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners of military service age and ability to own a fully automatic rifle. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners to train with the weapon. The law would FORCE VOR to keep his rifle clean. Hey VOR how about it? Keep your rifle clean or go to jail. I'm not talking about my rifle, I'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean. How about you?	Every round of the military's ammo is acounted for, because they don't want them waisting their money...
0	I believe you mean pro-choice, don't you. A pro-life mod might agree with you.	Well, pro-choicers, I wish all of you had never been born.
0	So? The point was that people who support gun control are not necessarily communists.	Afterall look at the Brady Campaign, one of their long time members was leaking classified information to the NRA and other pro-gun groups on purpose.
0	Oooh, I see. Only some presidents get experience, eh? And you think that Bush learns from his mistakes?! He doesn't even admit he makes any!Let me guess, only Republican presidents learn from their first terms, don't they? Pfft.	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO just because I stated that some presidents....cough.... Clinton.......don't get experience in one term doesn't
0	no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status.	that most people actually do have reasons for their beliefs, and that the world doesn't always line up with the all-or-nothing 'equality-obsessed' modern gay pride movement?

1	And Sotomayor argued that the American people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. What's your point?	Former Supreme Court chief justice Warren Burger complained about the NRA having too much influence in government and misleading the American people:
0	That's a bit of a sidestep. Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc. There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide. Frankly, I think it's easier to do the latter (yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty).If you want to make an argument, then make an argument. But don't call abortion genocide; that's just dumb.	[snip]Abortion supporters are infuriated at the notion that abortion is comparable to the Holocaust because they incessantly argue that the unborn aren't people.
0	So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say "Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."	He said it in Genisis, and yes the Bible is inspired by god, No its not poofed down by him but through his prophets he did get his message accross.
0	But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.	Geologic time/millions of years ago (mybp)/days per year late Precambrian/900mybp/487 days earliest Cambrian Period/600mybp/424 days early Ordovician Period/500mybp/412 days middle Devonian Period/370mybp/398 days Permo-Triassic boundary/245mybp/386 days "Jurassic Park"/180mybp/381 days end Cretaceous (Chixulub)/65mybp/371 days
1	I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation.   PS...from "our" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain.	Sorry, but that is nothing but hearsay from our point of view.
1	wow!! your such a guy! i bet you watch lingere womens football too dont you. womens basketball is on a much higher level then men. i bet you couldnt even tell me what a shot clock, three point shot, foul shot, or even what layup is. maybe if your tried watching womens basketball you would see how it is on a high skill level and how some wnba teams could beat mba teams.	the skill level of the wnba is nothing special and even a mens minor league team could beat them and since i don't watch minor league teams play i don't watch womens sports.
0	That's not something you can really blame on the pro-life movement. In fact, a lot of effort in the pro-life movement does go into helping single mothers. Many pro-life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways, including financially.	I can appreciate this slant, however I think that a true feminist approach would be to support women who want their pregnancies by finding solutions to the reasons they feel an abortion would be their best choice.If we want to have a child, society should be backing us up on that.
1	Aww, you didn't read a top criminoligist I quoted before did you?The "Myth" of Gun TraffickingYou also didn't check out mexidata.com either did you?Now you need proof to back up your alligator mouth. Where's the beef sliiiiick?	He bought them at gun stores in the San Diego area from June 2005 to September 2006, mostly one or two at a time."
0	It's the first couple of paragraghs from the article in this weeks NS. If you had an online subscription or got a copy from your newsagent you could read the whole thing, unfortunately with this one the intro rambles on a bit and doesn't get to the point till the second column...	Am I missing something, or does the linked article have nothing to do with what you said?
1	If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.	but should also deal with how information is gathered, and different ways of analyzing it as well as different hypothesies rather than what is thought at the time to be the facts.
0	So you still choose to believe that someone who's a victim of crime should be punished as if they committed the crime themselves?	It's not about finding the weapon.
0	Nothing.... they both have to live with the shame of killing their baby.	Off the top of my head...What happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child?
1	Ah yes, the Might Makes Right principle. Mob rule. You are so fond of it I have to assume that you assume the mob is always going to agree with you. Poor, naive soul...	That unfortunately is what seems to frighten a lot of people.

1	it must because he's a liberal. hey sarah, how come bushie's daddy, cheney, and rumsfeld all used to rub elbows with saddam? must be cause they were led astray by some liberal...	clinton laid out reasons why we should carry out that extensive bombing campaign in 1998. no un resolution, no congressional votes, no complaints from the left.
1	I get what you are trying to do but it doesn't work. You might as well say "let's print a bunch of money...pay off the debts...and then force people to burn it!".	I know what printing money can do, so when I proposed that we print money I also proposed ways to dampen the inflation it would cause.
0	And for good reason. Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with... electrical engineering. Examples: Walter ReMine, Fred Williams, etc.	Of course, they threw in that he's a prof. of Electrical Engineering - they couldn't help XXXX a little smoke to haze the issue.

1	You don't see protesters walking around going "I wanna marry my dog" or "beastiality rocks" do you?!	You forgot marry their dogs.
1	What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand?	Because the Constitution does not require them to :P It has been long established that States have authority over marriage definitions.
0	Because I am one who likes see things from different angles. What better way to fight your enemies then to understand their viewpoint. Before I am attacked on the the last statement, just because I understand a viewpoint does not meant that I accept it as true or that I don't reject it.	Why Matthew S do you find this article so fascinating?

0	But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against "choices" is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices.	Therefore only they know what's best for them and they should be the one making the descision.
1	because you wanna be wrong all the time...that seems like a good reason :)	...why I should be a liberal.
0	If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it.	This one has to do with babys in the woumb "Befor I formmed you in the woumb, I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet amoungst nations" Jeremiah 1:4-5I think this is rellavent because God wants everyone to be a prophet who he can work through.
1	So you're a perfect clone of one your parents with zero copying errors? Amazing.	It is not possible for any animal to lay an egg that is "somewhat different but somewhat the same".
0	It seems to be the reason for crafting this new, individual right against the States. Since the original purpose of the Second Amendment doesn't appear to be needed, there is a new use that is protected.	The 2nd amendment was only created to give citizens a last resort should the government fail us.

0	This seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists.	I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all.
0	I think I posted that awhile ago. Its huge BS. Thats like saying "Civil rights hurt blacks". Even though abortion may have some unwated side affects, its no where near the emotional and physical pain and suffering for the rest of your life than a forced pregnancy. Just goes to show that the pro-life movement is desperate.	http://www.catholiceducation.org/art...on/ab0102.htmlI actually haven't read all of this article yet, but it looks interesting.

1	So all of this ballyhoo and really you've changed nothing? emoticonXConfused   The entire system of inheritance and wills would still be in place.	However, if your son claims that you gave the wealth to him, in name only, on your deathbed, and all he has to prove it is word of mouth or documents that may be fraudulent, then it's not his.

1	Trying to argue with a person who is babbling nonsense is not my idea of a productive time to spend my time. I've explained myself and that's the end of it.   You can label my posts anything you want but that doesn't mean anything. It just means you are proficient in throwing out insults. So for purposes of this discussion I crown you the "insult king" of this forum.	Considering how Symbiote has you running around in circles trying to pathetically defend your contridictions, apparently it is you who does not understand.
0	And the point was, Benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. If you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. If it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. If it is a web page, then the URL should be given.Even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. Generally AIG is really bad science and isn't very interesting. It is misleading, intentionally. However, on these boards are familiar with their stuff.	Oh, and yes that is where I got that information, and took it directly from their web page.
1	wow, thats some poetic shit. i wonder to you roam around disagree with the people who boost about americas greatest, or how their a force for good. i wonder to you post wise ass comments next to these people. you have no idea how much of a hippocrit you are do you.	if only you would realize that you are part of the problem.

I have some things I'd like done and he can just say them while on the phone I'm hoping.  -Mach	why did god in all of his power and might need to say ok youre going to evolve slowly over millions of years into something else when all he did was simply speak and it was done?
0	your previous posts never mentioned underage sex with middle age men. underage sex is underage sex, dont try to move the goalposts. why the last five years? you asked if i had children because i stated that modern slasher films were as dangerous as simulated paedophilia. why did you ask?	if they're everywhere then name me a few from just the last five years.
1	Haven't we all . The difference is some of us know that most people have or will and that it does not make us a fount of knowledge. As you show us so well.	Nope, simply speaking as one who has been there and done that.
1	steve if i thought i could help you i would. i was called on using incorrect facts and your shooting out words like bagillion? you need to know when you in a dream. reality is scary i understand that.  i can't make a blind man see steve, if i could i would. seems you can't make an aware man sleep as well.	not only is phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality.
0	Don't be so faithful in our laws. Remember prohibition? Of course, I myself highly doubt that Obama will manage to ban firearms, but mark my words, he will do anything in his power to restrict them.	This difinitivly shows that he believes your right to own firearms should be taken away.
1	could it be that they've finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms? each time the control-lobby comes up with an argument....they get shot to pieces. (laugh out loud!) it is interesting to note that both of the democratic front-runners for 2008 favor gun control. with the recent death of charlton heston, there's a weakness in the armor of the nra. i would go on a handgun buying spree, but i already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call 'the little alamo'.	where in the hell did all the anti-gunners on this board go?
1	Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.	Imagine what proof for creationism that would be: we can only see stars out to 6000 light years or so; looking at old star charts we realize that people 1000 years ago could only see stars out to 5000 light years; and as time goes by additional stars appear in the sky as the light from them finally reaches us.
0	we could make this a little contest i suppose and see who gets the most right. for the primary categories anyway. picture, acting, directing, writing, any others? also definitely say what you think will, and what you think should.	i'm not to sure but i think it happened around the late 90's when hollywood decided that it was mainly ilm going up against industrial light & magic (for anyone who doesn't have it click, they're the same thing.
0	When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified.	…as the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets.” behe wrote this in 1996, and since then it has only gotten worse for the atheists, no matter how much they dance.
0	Do me a favor. Write, in your own words, two paragraphs. One explaining the electromagnetic spectrum (and the visible spectrum's place in it), and one discussing rods and cones in the eyes.	I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.
1	what the heck? owning an airport is evil now???  it is becoming clear at this point that you're pretty much grabbing at anything you possibly can, no matter how silly, to bash jerry falwell. he did enough bad things to where you don't need to resort to the benign things, to bash him. the man is gone. you don't have to worry about him anymore. move on.	you do realize that this god of yours is only a figment of your imagination.
1	and i am a clump of human cell with shoes on...what is your point? no. you seem to refuse the idea that 'human' as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up. i am sorry you don't understand this but the word means what it means. i find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway. your sperm is a human now? you should invest in a biology book.	technically, so is my sperm no matter how much you close your eyes and say 'no its not', but masturbation isn't murder is it?
1	The CIA seems to agree with me. Appears to me that you tinfoil hat is starting to fray about the edges.	Most think it undervalued, but since none of your opinions agree with anything factual that doesn't surprise meCare to take a guess at how floating the Yuan would affect world oil priced in USD while increasing China's purchasing power feeding China's expanding requirements at a savings for China?

0	i'm surprised, maybe your area of the uk is different, but in mine nearly all atheists are hereditary, or they just break away from the religions of their parents because they dislike their parents instead of the religion.	or was it some sort of overnight process, as in you woke up and just believed through some some divine revelation?

Americans might look and see their governments actually doing something USEFUL for the people and think that we should have that here.   I am surprised we have not nuked them yet.	emoticonXRolleyesIt's sad that so many Americans still refuse to see that the greatest threat this country faces is itself.
1	Half of the country is stupid enough to think that four (or eight) more years of Dumbya would be good.	I'm not paying a lot of attention to the "race" down there, but can anyone honestly say that McCain would be a good president?
1	I was under the impression that he was referencing the video...since he always interchanges the words embryo and fetus I just rolled with it.   Secondly, an embryo does have instructions for a brain...while a plant does not. I guess the answer hear depends on the ever evolving definition of "mental existence".	Therefore its mental existance is the same as a plant.A fetus is not a embryo.
0	Then why doesn't He answer prayers like He says He will in the Bible?   So is Jesus, aka God, a liar?   Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo's life to be saved really God's child? Gee, I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor, priest, or what have you, that prayed but God didn't listen because that religious leader is a fraud? Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!	* i wonder how much i would get paid to make up another idea for evolution and convince people its ture.

0	You have this habit of making sweeping claims with little to no substantiation.And even if we were to completely ignore LeVay altogether, there is MOUNDS of other evidence showing a genetic cause.Like I keep pointing out, but nobody on your side of the fence seems to realize, NARTH's OWN CITED REFERENCES say there is a genetic cause!	and the nutty professor from UC San Diego Simon LeVay who's myopic bent to show... and who's grant was provided to show that there was a genetic cause, failed miserably in doing so.
1	Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that "evolution" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance.	Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.
0	Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it...........That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people............They can't win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the courts....It won't happen.get use to it................	The justices are not to be the puppets of the legislature or the president.
1	Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world.	Nice observation, chum, but the real God - The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - is alive and well and wants to see you when you die.
0	And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is.	Man stabs, kills 8 children outside school in China The biblical end has got to be near.
0	All of these examples are scientifically recognized as human life with a unique genetic code.	My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, fetus, etc., is a Someone.
1	I have no idea what "women's rights" might be either. You could try to explain that to me while you are at it.	Now think "women's rights" but pretend you really don't like women, assuming you need to pretend.Same thing.
0	the word touched me in a bad place... i think it was at summer camp or something... i'm still scarred.... no but seriously even i don't believe that... how exactly is word spiritual? is it intentional? based upon the interpretation an individual gets from it? seeing as how the history of the bible itself and it's original writings, many interpretations, denominations, and debates over itself is construed it can hardly be seen as itself being spiritual. is it possible that through god the manuscripts and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality? yes. but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly isn't glowing with the essence of god.... it's debated if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exists has the essence of god to this day...	and you never know when a word of god will touch you, because the word itself is spiritual.
1	So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing? What's this world coming too? LOL	Hmm....some opposition to the petition...More left wing ideology at work.
0	the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex. there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals. in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds. and why shouldn't they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right. if you don't qualify then you don't enter. by all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.	ah, well, then you in you 'broad and unprejudiced view'emoticonxrolleyesemoticonxrolleyes can obviously tell us those supposed myriad other views.
0	As in we, do you mean we the USA or we, the World ? Because this is a World wide issue and not something the US can solve on its own in any case.	Sorry, I expanded my definitions here and was not polite enough to inform the rest of you :) I was not meaning to say JUST that nothing would be done about global warming (though I see now that it certainly appears that way).
1	Your posts read like gibberish when you fail to complete the thought. Try to be more careful in the future.	Crick is both a Nobel Prize winner and an evolutionary [biologist].
0	To be honest...I don't know. But I do know that to argue something is false because the consequences are not desired is a logical fallacy (Appeal to Consequences).So is the argument I posted earlier (posted below for quick reference) true or false? And if false, why?A) Only science should be taught in science class (this is why creationism should not be taught in science class).B) Science is a collection of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.Conclusion: If A is true and B is valid then science class should only consist of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.	Maybe a list of what is taught as science now that would be disqualified would simplify things?
0	The short answer is that it isn't. See the details here: Phil Plait	If one does the math backwards on it, the Earth cannot be as old as evolutionists claim it to be, can it?
1	Why? Would you rather get stabbed to death for twenty minutes than get hit in the head with a bullet? A desire to have suffering extended - hmmmm...	I'd still rather be chased by a person with a knife than run a zig zag pattern in an attempt to evade a bullet.
1	i was not trying to convince anyone. so what the hell is your point man? oh right there is no point. you are just trying to be an uncouth lout.	after reading what you wrote 0 people were convinced that the original quote wasn't funny.
0	None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about "information" or something.	http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmOne poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..." In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment.
0	For once I agree with you. Your wrong on your thoughts and views with evolution but your right in saying that abortion is wrong.	abortion is bad, there shouldn't be a need for it in the perfect world, but i'm not going to force my morality down your throat and force you to abide to MY principals while demanding you abandon your own.
1	so was dominating and enslaving of women. doesn't mean we should do it just because it has historicity.  actually i've heard this idea by numerous people, on both sides of the issue. i can see the merits myself--give couples' benefits in a way that doesn't utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with. that way at least cultural marriage doesn't have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group's cultural and ideological views.  by the way, what do you mean by 'anti-gay' in your phrase 'anti-gay people'? that's always important to nail down.	however, they would never be willing to give this up, so by denying gays the right of those same benefits for the same commitment, it is just pure and unadulterated bigotry.
0	23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so.	Do you know of any other crimes that your are guilty of when your are innocent in the past then the law makes you guilty later for a past event?If the speed limit is 40 mph on Monday, the law makes it 30 mph on Tuesday, are you guilty of speeding when it was Monday?
1	yeah, archie, i don't know what i was thinking. how could i form an opinion on the deeds of you and easy after about 6 years of interacting with the two of you, and watching the abuse and vile you spew on everyone who doesn't agree with your hate filled rhetoric? sorry about that, i must have been thinking of two other ignorant, insulting xxxxxxxs.	after you've spent 5 years volunteering for free, feeding and clothing the poor, and preaching the gospel at a run down christian rescue mission to ex-cons and the drug-and-alcohol addicted, as i have, then come talk to me about works.

0	What good has come from religion? None that I can see.	And when that good is pointed out with real examples, you change the subject to something that ignores the point, such as "ignorance is never good" or something like that.
1	I am still waiting for you to tell me why the gay priests only molested boys.......It has to do with how they are physically contructed.........	The sex of the child victims does not tell us the adult sexual orientation of the criminal.
0	'Self-defense' never enters into it, imo. Unwillingness to share ones body is not necessarily self-defense, so this does not apply.	She argues the child is not merely a stranger, but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self-defense.
0	No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic.	Is it irrelavent?
0	so? the assertion was 'evolution is based on evidence - what do you have' suggesting that one side has 'evidence' and the other none. i am simply 'balancing' it out by showing that the assertion isn't black vs white as made out.	it isn't the same as the nest day.

0	What is incredible is that this is probably the most enlightened response I can expect from this crowd.	Whoda thunk.As aboveHow about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.
0	yet everything in that site is cited with sources such as cnn and what not. i understnad the florida right to life is not credible to our discussion(as they are not neutral) however the things they cite are...and that is what you should look at. so murder is a subjective term now...i laugh at that. your point was what again? they fact that vor didn't prove his case and never does? i don't understand....however, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones).	besides, what is 'extreme?'
0	it's not a state's issue from a gay rights perspective, if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same-sex couples is illegal in marriage, as it did for inter-racial couples. what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage, be called? we already have such a contract. there's no need to totally re-invent the wheel at this particular time. foundit is correct. it's telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage.	foundit, obviously you have never actually bothered to read the libertarian position on marriage, which is to replace it with contract law, before complaining about it.
1	a bit over the top here eh? quicksand?...butcher babies? wow...very sensational... i have a question for ya ez? do you own any slaves? do you have a beard or long hair? have you stoned any non-virgin brides lately. seeing as though you are so adherant to the bible....i figure you at best have smited a neighbor or two this week?	if you had the missing link you people would parade it around like your long lost messiah.
0	so what? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards. he believed in freedom but owned slaves. wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color. this stance is very consistent with his double standard. he was also an adulterous, womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves. so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children.	whosoever shall be guilty of rape, polygamy, or sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.
0	Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.	if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died.
0	So, you don't see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun?? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one.	I don't see how this makes her as an anti-gun candidate.
0	who said pregnancy is the only bad thing? we already talked about ceverical cancer. furthermore, condoms don't always work...bad protection. maybe not, but wearing a bright red sign that says 'stalk me' sure will get the ones that are out there. your limited world shield you from the realities of life...which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents. aren't you a warm-hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum... does anyone else think this is rather odd?	it would make me think about it again.
0	Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments........	Welcome to the United States of America, where, if the people have anything to say about it, RELIGION DOES NOT MAKE UP THE LAW!

1	So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?Interesting...	And I sincerely do say this out of love.
0	However, so much of the sex, in fact, most of the sex that happens, gay or straight, does not lead to reproduction. Why is there not the same aversion to oral sex, masturbation, condoms, dating, etc.? No one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights, be excluded, or should not be equal, provided those people are not gay.	There are too many holes in that idea.
1	bitm (or whomever), are u sure that you weren't banned because you were caught blatantly lying? cause that seems pretty actionable to me. and welcome back broker! we've missed you're sensible conservativism!	admin, can you please search into this and let pnac know how wrong he is?

0	this is rather naive. who would willing condemn themselves to hell? many people commit sins regardless of the punishment. here's a little conversation to save time... i understand texas has the death penalty. are there any muders still going on? yes. why? who would condemn themselves to death? some people don't think they're going to get caught. they don't want to die themselves, but they just plain think what they do, they can get away with.	well, if god actually exist than so would hell, and who would want to go there.
1	ok to lie?? no. having people preaching 'the evolution of species from a cell to every living creature and plant life on earth', and tell me 'its darwin's origin of species, you should try reading it sometime', after i had just presented them an entire paragraph from hitler's meine kempf - entertaining! having your beloved talkorigins crew flunk the test straight-up as they were asked, 'who said the following, _________, hitler or darwin?', while going a whopping 0-3 for a revealing score of zero............ ...............priceless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	ok, now i follow you: it's ok to lie through your teeth, as long as you are entertained by the results that follow.
1	1) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted?? if you can't say its because you are a typical anti american liberal. 2) nothing to suppoprt it? if anti-american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives.  the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range. on the far left you'd have romney and on the far right you'd have ron paul. now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution.	and once again you have only your twisted opinion and nothing to support it..
1	So it doesn't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless, whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s: they are both equal? What planet do you live on, for it sure aren't the real world...	It means you wealth is unequal..we are talking about just people.
0	No, Creationism is the specific idea that the creation story in Genesis is literally true (creation ex nihilo, direct creation of organisms, global flood, etc). It is false.	It is simply the study of how we were created, just as evolution is the study of how we "evolved".
1	Where is the government in this? Clinicians made a clinical decision, and hid behind a non-mandatory guideline, which was set by other more senior clinicians, expert in their field. Assuming the woman's very detailed recall of the stressful series of events is accurate, perhaps it was God's way of telling this unmarried mother that after five previous miscarriages, she still wasn't getting the message.	and here is what you get when the government gets a hold of it.
0	"Supposedly"? You ran from those threads. You are the one making assertions that you don't back up. You are the one unwilling (i.e. unable) to show that Arctic foxes can adapt to a Phoenix summer. You are the one who keeps ignoring (what I will henceforth refer to as) The Chihuahua Challenge. For somebody claiming to be so clearly right and so obviously vindicated by the evidence, you've done nothing to show it, and you've done everything to run from it.	It's funny how you intellectually-inept fools resort to talking about how I was supposedly outdebated or embarrased or whatever in other forums yet you are unable to do it here.
0	Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.	Belief that memory and free will exist but do not take up space does not require belief in a personal god.
0	It won't. I'd think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active (a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion. Like vehicle insurance she may never need it, but going without either one is plain stupid.	It's still illegal for over the counter under the age of 18.Wait a minute, I fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not.

0	Welcome back! Going to stick around for a while to debate the issues? I hope so. Let's see. How am I going to stop the employee. Hmmm...perhaps proper pre-employment screening, proper security screening for all airport employees as they come to work, random surveilance of airport employees, tougher penalties for those commiting such crimes...etc. There are many ways to do this. Remember that no security measures are perfect. We will never be safe, only safer.And what is your point about weapons/guns? I don't get it.	How are you going to stop an airline employee that has access to the airplanes from hiding a gun onboard the airplanes for terrorists to use?
0	Again? What do you mean? I am talking about different sciences per se. What is your question?	Again, how does this apply?
0	economic understanding does not come from a series of graphs and equations that come from a man who has no understanding of how humans work. the economy is not some mechanical machine, it is an organic mass of all 7 billion people of the world making millions decisions every day. behind all the smoke and mirrors, all this man said was this, in other words, concluded bullshit is still bullshit.  and your second point, companies also compete on a technological level, if they aren't as advanced as their competitors they generally go out of business because people want the better quality/cheaper product. what is the states incentive? getting re-elected? oh wait, thats easy to do when 95% of voters have no clue as to what is going on and only think about politics for 5 minutes during the elections.	this is harder than it sounds because we are continually having crises.
0	Finally someone answered the question. Thanks. I thought it might be the government.Does your government attempt to do this?What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?	Well guns are a pretty good deterrent from the government trying to take away my rights.

You know, the way Lot did in the Bible. The one Peter called "a righteous man".	We all hope that Mass will be reclaimed back to normal life,away from this wicked glbt activism.We barely won back our California from this sodomite hell by voting Yes on Prop 8.San Francisco is a modern Sodom and Gomorrah where the abomination takes place.

1	Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago. My beef has been the resident "experts" here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand. That, by the way, is found in Economics 101. But you knew that, didn't you?So now, it's a "technical" correction. What's next? Some wisdom from Joe Granville or the Elliot Wave Theory?Ball in your court.	And if you think that inflation has no effect on the price of oil or any other commodity/stock, then you're either ignorant, stupid or both.
0	well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels.	and i know that most christians embrace things like the ten commandments, which are ot all the way.

It is based on evidence and not faith.	ok were supposed to believe in GOd and then believe in evolutin...
0	I think you are on to something.The problem I see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $$$ and propaganda.Here's hoping now that there's a new sheriff in town.	So basically either the public plan attracts most Americans, and our system gradually evolves into single-payer or because the floor prevents a race to the bottom, the public-private competition raises the bar on care and efficiency, improving quality and cutting costs, even in the private insurance plans.# The standards would be kept by a strong government watchdog.# What do you think?
1	Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage. So by all means don't marry a man and the problem is solved.	3) Of course if you throw out morality as a basis for law, there's no reason, other than economics, to not allow gay marriage.

0	So what's the deal when GWB "gives" $3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $6,000, the family can't make up the difference and the $3,000 goes unspent. All we've accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury. You think it's a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it? You're thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus.	Seems like you criticize him for allowing the government to "give" something, then criticize because it's not enough.
0	besides pain, there is a plethora of experiences that take place in a person's mind that cannot be yet detected by science. imagination, taste, dreams, art appreciation, etc. even though these things are real, they cannot be quantitatively described in physical terms, so they cannot be treated by science	Is there something physical explained as well by non-materialistic methods as well as Electricity is explained by materialistic methods?

0	That's the standard dance. Victor Stenger didn't say it that way. On the back of his book, one review puts it this way;	Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah, not that there is no God.Now, if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that "a Noah's flood-causing God" does not exist, then kudos.
1	i would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. they have no buisness doing that. very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. its simply a hobby. men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. our rights are going out the window fast.	then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case?
1	Oh, gee! There goes my irony meter. It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence. Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone.

1	You mean other than the fact that Mr. Pocketwatch and Mrs. Pocketwatch don't meet up for a night of whoopee and end up with little baby pocketwatches some time later? How about: I know that humans manufacture pocketwatches.	Yes, you can see the difference, but what is that difference?
1	You're a Bush-man, aren't you, gnojek? Come on, admit it. With that stance, you'll be in the White House before sunrise.  (You do realize that I was being sarcastic - right?) emoticonXRolleyes	then chrisitanity will be next in line, hopefully.
0	But doesn't Genesis imply that creation occured in one 7-day period (though the days could be symbollic)?	because the earth is older than 10,000 years as many creationists think and the 7 day creation doesn't make sense.
1	Liar, liar, pants on fire. You pro gay sex heathens haven't a clue what's coming your way. And you don't have to like it.	You will be right there in the pit to greet them, Easy.
1	Appears a lot of sensible folks are investing in their 401G and 401A plans ;)	Firearms, ammo see explosive sales growth -- Recession, fear of new federal controls driving increase
1	I disagree. Well, only in that I think it's high time we held everybody to a higher standard. We should suspend hetero marriage until they clean up their act!	Still, I do not feel that percentage likelyhood of a lasting marriage is a good reason to allow or disallow marriage.
1	Maybe you can talk when you provide us with the actual translation.	You do realise that the translation was supplied by an organisation founded by ex Israeli military intelligence members.....emoticonXRolleyes
0	lol, what did you mean by that? i'm not sure, and dont want to assume the tone you infer with. i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify. ps; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper', although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does'. @ simone, no worries hun :)	if a woman wants to have a leg amputated, that although crazy in my view, is her right but, as you well know it we are talking about the life of a baby in the womb.
1	that's not what the bible says. you're playing word games. what next? numerology??? i mean, i can play around with interpreting too. i can take 'roses are red, violets are blue' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to. let's see, roses represent love, and red is the color of blood. a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers, and blue means sad. so what 'roses are red, violets are blue' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful, and people with 'small things' are sad'. bet you never knew that's what it was really saying!	so, if you look at it properly, we can see that genesis is saying 'god formed man as a potter forms clay out of flesh and blood'.
1	a minute without kids? what's that? :) and about the thread - it might be a touchy subject. reckon? oh, and thanks - i feel 28! emoticonxcool	and just remember i am big enough to go along with the lucy joke... i even bought a lucy purse this weekend.. i just let it ride.... never let them know how smart you really are :) on edit so many people on right now, there must be more with children... or you and i are just having this conversation by ourselves :)
1	how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport.	When was the last mass murder at a UK university then?
0	This is absurdity. I suppose then that medicine should wreak my body. How about viruses? Am I destroyed by them?	And living things are the most complex functioning systems in the universe.
0	fine. thank you.  what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus. how do you define the moral consensus? in attilas case, would that be among the huns? among the hun ruling elite? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he (for the sake of argument) has no intimate knowledge?  now why should he act in accordance with the consensus?  this is not completely clear to me. so, do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned?	i'm not going quite that distance: i'm saying that moral values are expressions of approval/disapproval that don't arise from rational deliberation, but from the affective part of human nature.
