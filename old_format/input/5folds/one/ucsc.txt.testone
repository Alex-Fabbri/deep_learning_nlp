0	well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.	Just for the sake of argument, let's assume evolutionists had trouble explaining away the tongue of the woodpecker. How in any sense is creationism the alternative?:
1	yeah, ez is what will come back to haunt you. hay ez you know why i can say anything i want about jesus with out consequence? it's because jesus never existed. sleazy, when are you going to grow up?	jesus didn't come the first time to throw stones, but to save the lost. but the second coming and the final judgment are different stories.  'and i looked, and behold, a pale horse! and its riders name was death, and hell followed close behind.' - revelation 6:8 beware of what you say about jesus because i guarantee you it will come back to haunt you.
1	Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?	Anyone who suggests abortion is a dispute between the rights of a woman and a fetus is trying to mislead you or is negligent about the nature of abortion rights. This isn't a dispute between woman vrs fetus but instead an issue between a woman's right to abortion and the interests of a small yet powerful vocal minority who believe they can project their views upon the majority. Rights are not simply just passed out but are based upon interest…something the Supreme Court based their conclusion during Roe v Wade. In the many years that have supported abortion rights I have never found a single pro-lifer who could prove, outside their opinion and others, how a fetus has an interest in being born. Unfortunately for them, fetuses have never elected pro-lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice-versa. The pro-life movement plays as a self-appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus, at the moment of conception, has an interest in living. So the debate is just whittled down to two factions; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs. Women have a right to abortion because, as a nation, we have an invested interest in keeping abortion legal for them. For nearly 70 years we know that the fruits of coercion childbirth do not payoff…they lead to the corruption of law enforcement, provide criminals another avenue of wealth, wreck death and mutilation upon desperate women, destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that is rarely addressed by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place. Fetuses are immune from having an self-interest in being born because they have never developed such feelings in the sheer majority of abortion ever performed. Their brains are often far too primitive to hold such emotions or even awareness. If the fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then what is the big deal? Considering abortion was more legal during the times of our founding fathers then today.
0	That sounds like an honest answer. How did you feel about it at the time? How do you feel about it now? Just trying to educate myself more.   Huck	right now, i might consider it, as i am now a few weeks away from my graduation. back then, i would not, as i had just begun college (i was in my sophomore year for my bs - now i'm about to get my ms). however, there is also that other major part of my decision - i never had the intention to become pregnant, and we even took steps to make sure i wouldn't. that also is a major factor in any of my decisions on it.  another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on (acording to the doctors i spoke with) - i would be unable to work - that's four months, and while right now i am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that, back then i was just starting out, and would be unable to do so. so, i'd say that at the moment if that were to happen, and that i was paid a stipend (i know of no place near me that does so) and then gave the baby up for adoption, my fiance and i would seriously consider the prospect. i know that in the future - in five years or so - we expect to be able to have paid off all our loans, and we will then consider actually having a baby. so in summary - now i would consider it, but back when i had the actual abortion (6 years ago or so) i would not consider it.

0	It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!	Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?
0	you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are. any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what "morals" should be drawn out of the biomorphs.	So, this magical program that is supposed to represent life actually can also produce aeroplanes! I'd like to see DNA morph into such things!

0	Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.	The fossil record does not support this. So, in an attempt to deal with this problem, Gould and Eldredge came up with a theory called, punctuated equilibrium.
0	Almost? Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.	But what's REAL truth? The real truth is evolutionists can't even get that right. The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population.
1	So, am I looking for attention or am I mentally ill?	Most people with "divine experiences" are schizophrenics. The rest are looking to get attention. People are fallible, hard physical evidence is not. Once some of that turns up, I will start to keep an open mind to your side of the story.

0	Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By "true human" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent. I have got to go to school, continue this later.	It begins to look, then, that this is a piece of crude propaganda (see note below), deliberately manipulated to give the false impression that the fact of evolution is seriously under scientific question, and that the fanciful notions of creation `scientists' are contributing to that debate.
0	No. I never mentioned grades. You brought that one up. I'm saying that having guns on school campus isn't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area.	So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?

0	Well that is good that you recognize our society eats too much meat and too much protein. Now will you agree with me that you can get all the protein you need from whole wheat bread, oatmeal, beans, corn, peas, mushrooms, and broccoli? Now granted some vegetarians eat alot of junk food, and in that case they are NOT getting the right amount of protein. But many vegans like myself dont eat ANY junk food and follow the recommended food pyramid for vegans. I follow it very strictly and I know beyond any doubt that I am more healthy than the vast majority of Americans out there.	It is only because we eat too much meat and I had said that before. The point about needing animal protien wasn't that we aren't getting enough, but that we do need some of it in our diet to be fully healthy.

0	Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them. So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?EDIT: that seems dramatic...not "fire" them but they will basically go into another profession since they are no longer needed.	I think this is rather simple. There will be a decrease in volume or quantity of healthcare services. This will not include time of doctors who mostly tell their spport staff to do yet another test. So it will mostly include support staff, administrative staff, equipment manufacturers. They will not necessarily get paid less, there will just be fewer of them. Per person that is.
0	So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?	This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about “evolution” he's not talking about mere phenotypic change – he's talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that “evolution” has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered "evolution." The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:Let's take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no “dog genes” or “human genes.” But likewise there are no “tongue genes,” “tail genes” or “toenail genes.” Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.But it's worse than that.As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don't have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That's why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they've got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won't give up because they've seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.But here's where they're screwing everything up:When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That's excactly what science is doing with genetics: they've got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what's happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.So there it is. Go for it.
1	Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either. Then again, to be Christian, you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too. The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.	What if the answer to that was 0? You have begged the question.
1	Well then, you would immediately notice a 15% reduction in bullying! Rejoice!	No! emoticonXAngry Obviously School uniforms wont stop bullying because only about 15% of bullying at my school is due to clothes.
0	No Peeling, it would be, "We proved it was possible to evolve as humans have, so why can only we do it?" Why hasn't one other creature on Earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution? If evo is real, then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that weren't forced into extinction, but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years.Unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever. And that is my claim and belief.	I can't recall the name of this particular fallacy, but if I were to name it it would be the "If it were possible, someone would have done it already" fallacy, the consistent application of which leads one to believe it is impossible for anything to happen for the first time.

0	But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.	God is often the answer for the things we can't explain. Since we are not gods, we cannot know everything. Alot, yes. Everything, no.
1	No, but they will be forced to have babies if they have sex.	What? Women are being forced into having sex?
0	I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.	Any novel change/mutation in "expression" at the organismic level that cannot be directly linked to a novel genetic mutation can only be EAM, aka Devo-Evo, (that is, developmental evolution), a neo-lamarkian phenomenon. Why? Because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist, "ToE", that is, that such novel trait changes/'expressions' originate from-- "Random Genetic Mutation", coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that "Natural Selection" does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring. And there simply is no genetic mutation here. What it does show, empirically, are that organismic tyraits are not determined by genetic chemicals, but by the organism's usage of those chemicals to its own purposes and advantage.

0	you havent answered my question. if evolution is lacking the hard, observable evidence you say it's lacking, then surely you should have lots to say about atomic theory. however, you dont. why not? unification theory is different - theres no dependency on that theory like there is with chemistry or biology.	i watched a program on einstein and his theory of relativity yesterday on the history channel. good stuff. i'm a little interested in what he was working on when he croaked - the unification theory. that will develop more in time and then i'll pay more attention to it. i think god is the great physicist, and we'll see the beauty of his laws of physics in due time. 'for the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. he has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.' (nasa astronomer robert jastrow, god and the astronomers, p. 116.)
1	All science is provisional. For absolutes, we look to your interpretation of your bible. That's always absolute and beyond any correction.	Of course lesz, because there are no absolutes in evo right ?
0	I am so sorry to hear about what has happened to you. I hope you get away from this terrible man and surround yourself with people who love you.I must ask, though, why are you a Christian? You completely disagree with typical Christian sentiments on abortion, you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable, you feel like you did the right thing, so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day?	First thing I want to say is that I dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option. I also want to say that I love Christ will all my heart. He has forgiven me for my sins and because ive had an abortion does not mean im not a Christian and yes I was a christian when I did have an abortion. I had an abortion just this past june. ...I grew up in a christian home and was anti abortion most of my life but honestly I felt so relieved after having the abortion.
0	now, if we're talking natural insemination by donor, that would likely be morally unacceptable in most circles, though certainly not all. really? i mean that sincerely. sometimes i am really surprised by what people find immoral. most people seriously object to that? why? o.o	of course it's morally acceptable; if it's artifical insemination then does it really matter who performs the procedure, so long as they are qualified? now, if we're talking natural insemination by donor, that would likely be morally unacceptable in most circles, though certainly not all. is that what you were going for?

0	Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded. Hasn't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has. The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance. Here's some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com/andrys/noah	Meanwhile, there must have been provisions on the Ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water pH and saline content. Also not mentioned is the fact that Noah and sons must have collected seeds from every PLANT on earth because I am personally not aware of many plant types that can survive completely submerged for 40 days.
0	you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there.	this makes no sense. bet does not exist to be exclusive entertainment for blacks. it is ethno-centric programming. and not very good at that (tv1 is better). for there to be a 'white' channel, at least along the lines of what bet is aiming to do, there would have to be a single 'white' culture, which there isn't. and bet does not exclude whites from its programming.  your statement seems flat out racist to me. as i said previously, 'tookie's' defenders seem to be overzealous in their defense of the man (i can only take your word for it since i really haven't been paying much attention), but i do not see how their accusations have anything to do with hate crimes, and your perceptions of how they're enforced.

0	addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails	I'm still having a hard time with this. If nothing exists, no matter, then how can "the number one" exist? On what basis is it defined? If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created. I disagree in that IMHO, they are a function of our physical universe. IMHO, you don't have the concept without the universe to "define" it. I don't know, it's too early in the AM, maybe someone can point out the errors in my thinking.Waxy
1	as i observed earlier, you seem intent on attacking islam. why else would you devote so much energy to a thread entitled 'muhammed's child bride'? you've said it yourself, as in... and... howard suggested to you that you might learn something about islam by reading rumi. you asked me to quote to you from rumi? very well... spring is christ, raising martyred plants from their shrouds. their mouths open in gratitude, wanting to be kissed. the glow of the rose and the tulip means a lamp is inside. the wind is the holy spirit. the trees are mary. the scent of joseph's shirt comes to jacob. a red carnelian of yemeni laughter is heard by muhammad in mecca. and... moses, the inner light of revelation, lit up the top of sinai, but the mountain could not hold that light.	well, i apologise to both you and ez, but i must admit i am a little biased. though this is mainly due to easy rider tending to rely a little heavily on unexplained gospel quotations as argument, without any consideration for alternative meanings or possible context. though i realise this in itself is predisposing me slightly (maybe significantly) to one side, i think it is important to be able to argue your point from the opponents side if you really want to convince or convert someone.
0	so you get to whine and moan and complain (lie) that i didn't address your points, then when i challenge you to support your points against my counterarguments, you say that you don't need to. you're a hypocrite, archie.  ignore it? bhbcu64 made a valid point and made significant elaborations. the only responses we've seen are 'you're wrong' with no explanation, and two 'why does this follow?'s, apparently due to ignorance of that pesky little thing called law.	i was going to respond to jake, capo and electrolyte point by point when i realized that it would just be a waste of time; where as this post sums up the issue so rationally, concisely and reasonably that it is worth quoting just to repeat the truth it represents. thank you chloe for putting it so simply that anybody except a pro-abortion liberal can get it. in fact, you know that even they got it when they ignore it.

0	No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.	Evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change

1	So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others, should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not?	The figures for the number of gun related deaths in the US should be evidence enough that 'the people' cannot be trusted with guns.

0	Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.	ahhh, thats where youre mistaken. ANY aspect of science that can be discredited helps strengthen the creationist stance.
1	I dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  Once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  We are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but I am sure the preacher would condemn that too  If you read the link you would know.  If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  You really should try to use your little head more.  'Lets stay on topic' who made you a mod?emoticonXChicken	that's a false analogy. people who are sexually attracted to children harm children, and harming someone is a crime. homosexuals do no harm to anyone, and are nothing like pedophiles. and for someone who doesn't tolerate government intrusion, you sure seem to like government intrusion when it comes to interfering with marriage. huh? are we talking about gays or fornicators? fornicators being someone who has sex before marriage and gay being a man who is attracted to a man in the same way a straight man is attracted to a woman. lets stay on topic.

1	Strange, I thought it was supposed to be a global flood that wiped out all of man except the chosen few. That would be 'involving Australia' one assumes.	It's more than likely the Trinity that's referenced in Genesis 1:26, etc. That's the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit for those of you who live in Yorba Linda.You're the spiritual dwarf who's confused. Perhaps you should humble yourself and get some Godly wisdomPartly right. The dinosaurs were long dead before the flood. Your latest reach, however - that the Bible stole the flood account from another culture is another one of your unfounded liberal myths. It's more probable that the other culture(s) stole it from the descendants of Noah in the first place.As for Xcaliber's Tourette Syndrome rant about having to go to Australia to pick up Koala bears, God doesn't need to do that. It's Biblically-based in Acts 8:39 that he can just "translate" the animals from Australia to the Middle East. That's assuming the flood involved Australia in the first place.
1	i think you underestimate the intelligence of a 6 year old and what they can comprehend............... and that 6 year old is not only the people but the future which makes it even more imperative that he or she know the sacrafices others have made to make this country the great country it is........ i am not surprised you call it brainwashing though....... emoticonxrolleyes	what six-year old kid actually understands the ramification of such a commitment? especially with god attached? it's indoctrination, brainwashing, whatever word one cares to use for enforced learning not related to education.  and i think you have it a little mixed up, this country is the people.
1	In that case a man in a coma is not a person then, is he?	A human life is only a person once there is someone existing there. Before a fetus has a mental existence, it is just a growing human body - a thing, not a person. A thing cannot suffer, cannot feel pain, fear or even feel anything for that matter. How can you have empathy for a thing? Once a fetus develops a mental existence, then it is a person worthy of protection, as are all people.
1	But you sure don't hesitate to portray them that way when you use one to bolster the other! Or when you fail to actually (GASP) qualify the matter by noting the differences as well as the similarities. Hey, it's just accuracy, so why get in a fuss over it, huh? emoticonXRolleyes Why not go ahead and invoke the Jewish genocide while you're at it, or call anyone who has a different opinion "Hitler?" I mean it's the same sort of generalization.	In the name of all that is evil and unholy ...Jyoshu - I have never said that the civil rights movement of blacks and gays are identical!Not once!
0	But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority.	IMO, that's beside the point. The problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people. Sure, people may still oppose gay marriage even if it's done legislatively as opposed to judicially, but at least then they'd have the chance and opportunity to do so. With only the judicial means, people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important. So I think there really is something to this concern than gay marriage is slipped in via judicial fiat. Of course you feel they shouldn't have a say, so you have no problem with the idea of doing by judicial fiat.
0	So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?	I don't believe in any gods, but thankyou for assuming anyone who disagrees with your ridiculous assertions about proving gods non-existance must be a theist.Just like creationists assume anyone who disagrees with creationism must be an atheist.You're just as bad as them, and your arguments, if you could call them that, just as short on substance.
1	like in afghanistan? hopefully it will go a little better with this puppet, his own bodyguard was the latest in a slew of assasination attempts.	i think we should go to war with iraq. we know they have weopons of mass destruction. he has 16-17 weapons of mass destruction, this violates code 1441. some people don't want to go to war because they don't like it. no one likes war but you got to do what you got to do. others (even though they wont admit it) doesn't want to go to war just because bush says we need to. theyll do anything to rebel against bush.
1	oh yes we do think so. as you know very well where that figure came from.  the latest study at harvard. new study finds 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage | harvardscience interesting, isn't it, how our side is always quoting figures from harvard and such, and all your ilk can dig up is 'townhall' and hannity's second grade collages.	care to explain where this fiction came from? i didn't think so.
0	So producing a child is the defining characteristic of a marriage? What about love, trust, respect, companionship? My wife and I may decide to not have a child, does that mean our marriage should be made illegal? Again, you keep posting nambla this and nambla that. Nambla is a group of deviant pedophiles, homosexuals despise this behavior too. GROW UP DHARD...I mean DMG2FUN. ;)	When two gay men get together and have sex that produces a kid is the day I will defend gay marriages.Plus if this is ok then why do gays need organizations like nambla to recruit children into the gay life style.
0	Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?	No. Not in matters of science.
0	No more so than the Scalia/Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case.	And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.
0	And as their populations grew over thousands of years, civilizations seperate out and independent nations form, laws are set up, and some prosper while others wallow in poverty, how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets? Nice dream, but real life does not work like that.	As much as I'd love pacifism and peace and tolerance and all that wonderful stuff, and I do believe, as my signature says, that violence is the last refuge of the incompetent, it can't be helped so long as we live in a world where people think they need violence. I say take a few pacifistic Earthlings, resettle them on other planets, and build nice and peaceful Spacer worlds away from the violence and squalor of this planet. :)
0	take a look at your post no. 80 time-stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said ...in response to my post #79 wherein i said: does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say? back in post #77, i requested that you quote and debunk the links. you merely scoffed at them (as i expected). prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument, please explain the above. i'll be back next week.	just as well, i dont like arguing with a liar, so call us even. not once did i change the meaning of anything you said, so unless you'd like to quote where i did that, all you have is baseless assertions and a cool method of squirming out of statements you cant support

0	so what about jesus' life is credible if the source is unreliable? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead? what did the authors get right? i mean, i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace. but you dont. so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did?it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true, otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have.	First Paragraph:"christianity is living a lifstyle patterned after the teachings, actions and philosophies of christ."Sure, not a bad definition."in order to do this, you must accept that the records of christ's life are fact."Every single word in the gospels? No, not at all. Remember, the works which became the new testament were around for centuries before they were actually compiled into the Bible. And none of the originals still exist. Who knows what changes were made to the account of Jesus's life before they were finally compiled. For example, look at Matthew 10:34 "Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword." Doesn't sound much like Jesus, does it? It certainly doesn't fit into the picture that's generally painted of Jesus. In the end the New Testament was written and compiled by mistake prone people. Some may believe that it's the unadulterated word of God, but looking at the above passage it's also easy to believe that it's also the work of common people.The rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line, and I believe I've shown that a reasonable person might not, so I'm going to skip to your next paragraph.
0	The majority of criminals don't want to deal with trouble. Most aren't looking for a shootout where there's a risk of them getting shot at and most don't even want to shoot period. Most are just looking for the free stuff they can get or in cases of rape they're definately not looking to fight an armed victim. It has been shown that criminals are less likely to break into a house whose owner has a gun.	More likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance.There is no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand-gun
1	I think that might mean that you should shut your trap about other people and not pass judgement on them (i.e. Carl Sagan right here in this topic, etc.). What do you think?	Romans 2:11You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
1	If by "We the People" you mean a handful of self appointed persons with strong financial intrest in the running of the country...   The document is largely a copy of the theories of Montesqieu and John Locke.	At the risk of becoming embroiled in a seemingly heated exchange, I think I might interject with a little history....To answer Smiley's question: “who wrote the constitution?” I would say the answer is found in the preamble to the document: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” (bold emphasis added)
0	I don't that it's selfish so much as self-interested. There is a difference. Most people want to live a long life. Is this selfish? The idea of an after life is merely an extension of this same idea.Why do you think belief in an afterlife leads to contempt for society?	Sorry, I did swerve a bit on the original topic. The concept of the Nicene and Chalcedonian Christian was a new concept for me and very engrossing, inasmuch as, in contrast to the aforementioned faiths, Mennonites and other such Anabaptists didn't seem to focus exclusively on the eternal life of the believer as being the most important aspect of faith. I am inclined to believe that the desperation of one to "exist forever" is a very selfish conceit and leads to contempt for the rest of society.
0	The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true.	This statement is wrong.

There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins o
1	Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.	for everyone's information, i've told my mom. (i have no father to tell) and i was safe. so if that satisfies everyone's dues then this is done with.
0	maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points.	Again show me something other than an opinion. Describe how the avian lung could have evolved over time. Other than IT did it.

0	I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures, such as the literal reading of Genesis (which was never meant to be literal to begin with, but that is a different matter).It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people.However, when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe, science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being.	Wrong. 1) Science has disproven the young-earth Creationists' God. 2) Science is starting to shed light on people's spiritual beliefs.
0	really? wow! my parents did the same thing! we had a water-cooler bottle that my dad put change into for years, and when we were little kids we went to cash it in, all of us helping to roll the hundreds of pounds of coins, and it ended up being worth over $900! ever since then, i've been a coin fanatic. people are so quick to throw away change. my friends know that i'll always take a nickel or a few pennies if they don't want to carry them around.	that's what my parents did. they saved coins for about 10 years in a huge 3ft jar shaped like a giant bottle. anyway, my sister and i took them in... about $1000 but now we don't have any coins.
1	It's only obvious to the delusional ones, as I did not lift it from anyone. Just stating the truth. If it hurts, tough.	It's an entirely different type of relationship though.

0	So have you found figures pertaining to the rate of mountain growth? It is not enough to see with the naked eye the way erosion is. This explanation would also cause some mountains to fall as tectonic plates move away from eachother. Again after billions of years all rivers in existence would be deeper than those in the grand canyon without the material coming down from mountains.	The upheaval due to movement in oceanic and continental plates currently outpaces the rate of erosion. This is know and quantifiable given that all branches of sciences and all current forms of dating back it up.

0	Now you are confusing me. In a previous post, you wrote this: "A gay couple has no more right to marry then two brothers"But now you say that you never said there "is no right to same sex marriage." So are you arguing that two brothers do have the right to marry? I am reading your posts, but you seem to make contradictory arguments. That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway. It sounded like a nuanced argument to me. But apparently that is not what you were saying? Can you clarify this?Thanks.	Nonsense. An interacial marriage is exactly the same as a single race marriage. Your argument is meaningless not mine. I did not say there is no right to same sex marriage and I did not say that same sex marriages should be illegal...I thought that you read my posts..you obviously do not......

1	Er . . . how do you know that god hasn't told anyone to kill enmasse (in the last 2000 years)? Does he run all his orders by you?	What I have the guts to do is to submit to Gods perfect understanding and not hold the eternal God of time and space to the limited perspective which we have as finite beings. To claim superior knowledge to a perfect, holy and eternal God is the epitome of "arrogance" which you obviously are not lacking. I am humble enough and introspective enough to look at my own past, recognize my own human frailties, nature and shortcoming and humble myself before His perfect wisdom and knowledge to see clearly that which isn't clear to me at the time.Also, just to clarify, God hasn't told me or anyone else to kill anyone enmasse in 2000 years since the advent of the Age of Grace which Jesus, our Messiah ushered in.

0	if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?	you might look back a little further. people have been warning for the last 30 years that deindustrialisation is a really bad idea, and that loading up massive amounts of personal and public debt is an even worse idea.

0	is this what jpsartre meant? at any rate, to say that there were large numbers of gay men, being infected in the u.s., is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself. there is a connection when there is active sexuality, gay or straight, and aids is a sexually transmitted disease. we actually don't know who patient zero was. what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men, and fewer heterosexuals, to the best of our available knowledge? this is a disease, and unknowingly spreading it, no matter who you are, is not murder. the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group, who had sex among that group, before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it; that would also not be murder.	becuase the thread is primarily focused on the initial outbreak and spread of aids in the us, and to say there is no connection between that outbreak and spread and sexuality either demonstrated that you are either completely and totally ignorant of the facts, or you have utterly blinded yourself in the name of political correctness.

Well, I define illness based upon the way medical professionals define illness, in which case, homosexuality is NOT an illness, and pedophilia is.Upon what criteria do you define illness?Upon what criteria do you judge them as wrong?

0	that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?	however, ideas for laws come from a morality. in fact, our constitution did. to sit around and watch people die. that is something i'd rather not do and i am forced to.

The deterministic mechanisms that affect a hurricane are well understood and predictable. On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as “temperature and embryonic diet” might cause proteins to fold differently and thus “whip up” complex systems such as “eyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shells”
1	Yeah, lets tax those rich greedy jerks!!! I mean really, why be equal when you want something for free right??? SCREW FREEDOM I WANT MY HEALTHCARE!!!	Public healthcare tends to have problems when right wingers refuse to actually tax the wealthy the amount required to fund it. You get what you pay for in this regard. Increased public spending in the UK has started to provide significant increases in service, though it is taking time to make up for underinvestment.
0	based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not.	this is directly from their website: thousands did not die, this number was known to be made up.  see... http://www.catholic.net/rcc/loveboth/chapter27.html http://www.factcheck.org/article336.html the number of illegal abortions is also overstated...some estimate it is only around 100,000...considering 1973 only had around 800,000 abortions it doen't seem likely that a year before 1million were done illegally.
1	And so goes the fact you're more than willing to let rapists and murderers go free.	There you go again, conflating questioning with disobeying.Da*n right you should question the cop who pulls you over."When was your speed gun last calibrated?" is a good question."Are you sure you got me and not the truck next to me?" is another one."Were you in a position to see both my car and the stop sign?" is #3.Do you know the law on where at an intersection the law requires me to stop?" is #4."Is your speed gun accurate on a curve?" - #5Oh yes, I have LOTS of questions for any cop who stops me.No tickets in 35 years have stuck to me, and I have had fun making horses' a**es of cops in Court!!

0	Form 4473, question 11a reads as follows:11.a. Are you the actual buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.	"The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.

1	pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ?   your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.  My advice to you ?  keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.	one needs not be ancient to know more than those around them. my age is irrelevant to the fact that i simply know more than you can comprehend. because unlike others i'm observant and actually pay attention.
1	Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.	...Many of Carl Baugh's creation ‘evidences'. Sorry to say, AiG thinks that he's well meaning but that he unfortunately uses a lot of material that is not sound scientifically. So we advise against relying on any ‘evidence' he provides, unless supported by creationist organisations with reputations for Biblical and scientific rigour.
1	I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?	You'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent, before I'd agree that they are as bad as you imply, but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes. Why? Because Christians have guidelines about lying.
1	and yet you ignored the specific link mentioning the current regs while asking for it at the same time.  no, i dislike your techniches because they are unethical, hold double standards, and aren't based on facts.  oh yes, who was the one who asked for the reg link while ignoring it at the same time?  the fact that you quote newsmax says much about how much credence anyone here gives you.	most of his links were in reference to another question. that's partially my doing as i introduced the kerry attack in the wrong thread. i don't like to hijack threads. i'm just addicted to hating kerry because he was pro-communist in the early '70s. maybe he can be appointed ambassador to north vietnam after he loses this election! you dislike my techniques because i point out your propensity to confuse and digress when you try to argue. you come up with more unrelated **** than anyone else on this board. your sense of logic is blinded by your delusions of adequacy. i put little credence in anything you say.

0	Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age. What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is? What is the importance of knowing if somebody's white, black or mexican when they're buying a gun?	A more logical explanation is that there may have been racist gun laws during a certain time period but gun control isn't inherently racist.
0	End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.	and you consider it drivel because?the amendement reads:A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. So it could be either with a literal reading of the amendement.

0	Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child? Not likely. I think she will still suffer through those thoughts. Killing the baby complicates this. What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion?	The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis....

0	But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government.	But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against "choices" is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices.
1	It's also a noun. But since you're unable but to repeat your self, maybe a few more times will make it 'true'	Cold, again, is just an adjective. If you take a fish from the arctic seas, and put it in some chilled water (say, 5 degrees celcius) then that fish is going to think it is very hot, despite the fact we would call the water cold.
0	i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a "possibility of existence". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: "greatest possible being". the "greatest possible being", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole "proof" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as "the greatest being possible". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled	let me try to translate into words1. if there is a god in this world, there is a god in all worlds2. there being a god is a possibility3. If there's a god in all worlds, there's a god in this one4. There not being a god in all worlds implies that there's isn't a god in any world (all or nothing)5. There is either a god in all worlds or there isn't a god in all worlds6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world7. if there's no god in this world then there's not a god in all worlds8. There's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world.9. Since god is a possibility we know the statement <there is no god in any world> is false.10. Since there's a god in all worlds there's a god in this one from 3Is this the right interpretation? If it is there is one flaw in it. #9 is flawed. Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.
1	As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.	As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off. Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort.

FreedomWorks LIED about CBS reporting "2 million". Even Fox News puts the attendance in five digits, yet FW tries to pretend they are much larger.2) Pretend a uniformity of presence behind a rational banner, when the truth is that a LARGE segment of attendance sits behind a looney banner (like calling the president racist or Kenyan or secret Muslim or fascist / socialist / communist / nazi).THAT is my point.Or an even more popular one?The strawman argument!

Or the fact that I made a politically incorrect assertion? emoticonXConfused	Jake, while I don't agree with JP that this should be an issue of blame, with all due respect, your point here is a bit disingenuous--smallpox isn't easily spread by engaging in a given behavior as HIV is--HIV is a sexually transmitted disease.
1	First off, your sick. To actually want to see more death and destruction.  Are Americans somehow less intelligent? Your notions are racist for lack of a better term. What to meet stupid? Walk out your front door and sample the people on the side walk. You'll find the same stupid around the world.	how boring. i hope they do bomb the us, but actually get the pentagon this time. of course, dumb patriots will let the gov't do anything then. i remember when the show 'talking to americans' asked random americans whether they should bomb saskatchewan. without asking for any more information, people gave long explanations about how saskatchewan needed to be put under control and all kinds of bs.  of course, saskatchewan is a canadian province which is not at all being considered a threat by the us gov't. that doesn't matter. the us political climate is such right now that people will swallow any amount of bs, and are willing to excuse any action on the part of their gov't. pathetic.

0	Very sad news. I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery.	Once again this only confirms my belief that republicans are evil and celebrate gay oppression.http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/06/062007yorkmar.htmWe even have one quote.So it seems that gay people and our families are to remain 2nd class citizens to preserve this evil mans heterosexual privledge. How is it that "the way he was brought up" is more important then protecting gay people? What of they way gay people were brought up? What about the threat to our freedom that Brian Kolb and his evil religion and political party represents? I was brought up by my father, taught in school that all people are equal. His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up. I do live in Michigan and not in New York but his evil statements and attitude are the same here if not worse. I was shocked to find out the Romney was the son of a former Michigan governor and that he is from Michigan. Does figure with all the anti gay religious nut cases that are swarming in the woods here in Michigan.

1	So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?	Therefore, we can conclude that teaching evolution is not teaching knowledge nor science, and as such, is teaching ignorance (defined as lack of knowledge).
1	I won't hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you've composed. Guess we'll chalk it up to puffery.	Sinjin is quite content to register all firearms as has every dictator in history prior to confiscation. His compliments to the current system in kalifornia is nothing short of complete advocacy of registration and confiscation of privately owned firearms. What he doesn't want you to know is the depth of lawlesness and infringement is already in effect and is only working to punish innocent people and has nothing to do with crime control...it is all about ultimate disarmament and loss of Second Amendment rights. There is a word for these people, now what was that?
1	And the Brady background check has not been repealed either so by your "logic" it must be effective.	Well let's look at the facts themselves. Concealed carry laws are now part of the legal system in 48 out of the 50 states in this country. Concealed carry started in Florida and worked their way from one state to another over a continuous 20 year period, and not once has a concealed carry law ever been repealed, for any reason.Gun control laws, like handgun rationing, mandatory reporting standards, ammunition registries, secondary background checks, trigger lock and storage requirements, etc. are limited in their reach, sticking to only certain states. There's been no mass adoption of these laws by various states across the country, and there's even been cases of them being repealed due to ineffectiveness.If gun control laws worked at controlling crime, and the presence of firearms actually had the potential to increase crime rates, these facts would be reversed.
1	so, global warming no, but weather control devices, yes? perhaps too many people are playing red alert these days...	there was a catagory 5 hurricane back about 105 years ago that hit texas. as long as catagory 5 hurricans have been happening, it doesn't make sence that catagory 5s are created by a cold war device. now the fact that there is a hurricane in the pacific ocean (it's named a boys name that starts with the letter 'm'. hurricanes are not supposed to happen in the pacific ocean. the fact that a hurricane is in the pacific ocean when usually in the pacific ocean is a typhoon (and a cyclone over austrailia) suggest something odd. emoticonxwow

1	So if it was deemed by 'those with the knowledge that give their opinion weight' that a fetus can feel pain and stress during a termination you would agree that the termination should not be carried out..well done	1. Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight...
1	Really? Well, when I have a kid, I'll be sure to just leave it in the woods, since it can apparently care for itself.	The key issue is that once children are born they are not physically dependent on a particular individual.
1	Balderdash! Atheism isn't science. That's nonsense. And science is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is.	Atheism, (thinly disguised as science) creates the hypothesis that there is no God, and works backwords [sic] to find evidence for only that hypothesis.
1	ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked.

And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do.	What parts of the Bible are true, and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true?
0	Of course not. That battle has already been lost. Creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class, even when it is called "creation science" and the data is distorted and mininterpreted. The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board (and yes, they were YECs) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution, and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards.	I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase "Young Earth Creationists" in any official capacity, nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught.
1	So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed.

They just make people want to kill.

A doctor / patient can claim doctor/patient confidentiality. It's a recognized and valid situation.But with the "knowthyneighbor", these polls are PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. The purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud.If you weren't so intent on trying to bash, you would recognize the obvious distinctions... emoticonXRolleyes	Hmmm, posting person information online about someone that could result in harm to the person among other things. Seems a lot like the "knowthyneighbor" BS you support Foundit. Now you will come up with some lame excuse for a difference between the two but in the end both are bad ways to deal with the issue.
0	But it's not detecting any "new" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting.

If a telescope can see a new color, how can we observe the information?
0	That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your "apple falling" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple.	Now we come to the problem with the "theory" of intelligent design. There simply has been no thinking involved. The equivalent of ID is doing all the experiments with the apple, measuring the mass of the apple and the Earth, and figuring out gravity, publishing it, and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments, with no refutations or flaws, and then some people coming along and saying, "well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does, ever think of that? We should teach them that this is a valid alternative to gravity." I also offer you this for humor: http://www.venganza.org/

0	so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?	i'm assuming static because that's the case i'm interested in. in real terms, i'm holding a ball; it's motionless with respect to the earth. i let go. what about warped space makes the ball move towards the earth? that's the specific question that i'm trying to get an answer to. yes, the marble should roll towards the ball regardless of the orientation of the sheet. if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy works as long as you do it in the presence of gravity, but that smacks of a circular definition to me. an analogy for gravity that requires gravity doesn't convince me, or explain anything to me.
0	Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.	because i said so! lol,... i'm so silly. i just had to post it.  seriously, i decided that i will actually construct my summary online, iangb. if you (or anyone else) cares to, you will be able to watch as i edit and construct my argument. it may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if i have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, i will have to delete this first half and move it to the end. by the way,... other than working some things out in my head,... i don't have anything prepared to post. this will be a work in progress. ... this will take quite a while. (maybe days) i see you are watching, and don't want you thinking this will be developing quickly. i will let you know when i've concluded. --chuz *** note to ian. in my attempt to compile my 'summary' i have realized that i never actually completed my arguments. it's kind of hard to summarize that which hasn't already been presented. so, my sumarization if you will- will now consists of two parts. first my arguments and then my summary.  work in progress; the argument biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception definitions; a begin being biologically child conception egg embryo fetus  gamete  human individual life metamorphosisorganism sperm zygote-dictionary.com a begin being biologically child conception egg embryo fetus gamete human individual life metamorphosis organism sperm zygote-- free dictionary.com child  due process clause person --findlaw.com links logic a distinct human organism american college of pediatricians the human organism when does a human individual's life begin the physiology of aging human growth and aging wikipedia; life when does life begin? quotes; sperm; 'during fertilization, the nucleus of a sperm fuses with the nucleus of the much larger egg cell (the female reproductive cell) to form a new organism'.-the american heritage® science dictionary barack hussein obama; 'we need fathers to recognize their responsibility doesn’t just end at conception.' william jefferson clinton- 'if two cells join in the process that begins to make a human being, are they living? answer? no one disputes that.

1	i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around.	no, but abiogenesis does, and they are 2 sides of the same coin as they are presented as one process following the other. it is so deceptive and disingenuous to constantly separate them as unique processes while all the time knowing that one study is the scientific continuation where the other ends. you are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they aren't connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms. so stop with the denial and word games and face the truth for once in your life.
1	that is an utter contradiction. he knows what is going to happen, but wants to preserve our freedom of choice? what freedom? please, explain so i can understand, this 'freedom' which gives rise to only one possible future! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny. no ifs, buts or maybes. this isn't about god deciding our future, it's about whether we can. well, that's one interpretation. another would be 'not sticking our heads in the sand'.	but if he intervenes, then the events will have changed and were therefore not foreknown after all. the whole issue of foreknowledge would be moot at that point, and freedom of choice would no longer be there. i think people sometimes make the idea of forknowledge more complicated than it needs to be by getting into paradox and blame issues. it basically means that god knows what's going to happen before it happens. but he doesn't intervene in order to maintain humankind's freedom of choice. foreknowledge is not the same concept as predeterminism.
1	You know my answer: There is no god and no one "created" mankind. But the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under "Religious" or "Philosophy" section, not abortion.   Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?	You didn't mind commenting about God ('the Lord's prophets') just before I wrote my question above to you, so why are you running scared or bugging out now?Looks to me like you couldn't answer the question. So where's the beef? Answer the question?  Tell me how God creates mankind with free will but at the same time doesn't allow man to sin?
0	Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, "Turkana Boy" It is also sometimes called "Nariokotome Boy". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil.	I gave you the name and a thumbnail...if you aren't bright enough to go look at a bigger picture than I can't help you.
0	no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe.	great,if artificial wombs become avaliable then women can get zygote transplants rather then abortions,but the question for me is 'do zygotes have a right to life?'why does mere biology automatically = right to life? if this were the case than non-humans that are biological alive should also have the right to life.
1	Yeah, cause there are sooo many 100 year old corks just kickin around.	I can cork a bottle of Two Buck Chuck with a cork that is 100 years old. The point is, how old the wine is, not the cork.
0	You said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. How is that a misinterpretation?   You're asking for proof of a negative. How many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? We don't know...   Erm.... You're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly. I'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class.	the classic anti-gunner misinterpretation. what i'm advocating is that we stop this naive belief that we can save lives by banning guns on and around school property, because the victims of columbine and virginia tech will tell you that this belief is wrong. despite this inane fear that so many have, there aren't going to be shootouts between students and teachers over a d- term paper. how do i know this? because the people that have permits to legally carry guns aren't murdering each other over dented fenders, parking spots and disagreements over which football team is best. furthermore the 1,000 foot gun free proximity zone around the school is totally useless. it does nothing to ensure or promote safety, it's just a big inconvenience to people who live near a school, and a potential trap to anybody who's traveling to or from the local range. should you really be guilty of breaking a federal law by simply having a gun while being 999 feet away from a school, while your friend who's 1,001 feet away from the same school, with a gun, is completely innocent and not facing felony charges? the intelligent answer in this case would be 'no'.

Apparently, we're headed into an ice age of about 100,000 years -- give or take. As for CO2 levels, core samples show conclusively they follow the earth's temperature rise, not lead it.
0	I didn't answer or you didn't understand? Actually I did answer. The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it. The skull, even though I gave it very ape-like features, is from a biped. There are many examples of what I described.	"So, anyhow, can you tell me, in a nutshell, how looking at the bone structure can tell one how a creature lived it's life? It's specific habitats? What it ate?"Outside of a nutshell, you still didn't answer the question.
1	i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel	yes, i'm sure that's true as well. makes complete sense. but the article is saying that among those with unintended pregnancies, those who are using, are more likely to have an abortion than those who are not using. to me that makes sense as well, but i just wanted to clear up what it was saying.
1	what country are you from? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law. the legislature writes it, the executive approves it, and the judiciary interprets it. the people have no direct say what so ever.	its because if you want to change law you shouldn't be able to exploit the judiciary..you need to do it like everyone else has (up until 50yrs ago) which is go convince the people and run it like a democracy.

1	Why would I worry about a book of myths and fairy tales?	Sorry, folks, but you can't talk about death and leave out Jesus. You will all have to bow down and confess Jesus is Lord once you meet him at the Judgment.Recommend you read Romans chapter 3.
1	So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized "Good morning, sweetie", that would be an answer?	You did not ask for a quote which says "we should ban guns" and you posed the question TO "anti-gunners" you did not ask for anti-gun comments.
1	Whose culture are we talking about, here?I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?	That "one iota" we're discussing is a major change: part of the very heart of what marriage is.
0	Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two.	You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.
0	So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant.	If I am to believe in something even if it's scientific, I should be able to challenge the belief's of the person who's pushing it. If they don't believe in what they're selling, why should I.
0	And where exactly did you hear this? I find it hard to believe a governent that couldn't keep an affair or a low-level break-in under wraps could keep something like that secret................. Also if it is true and among alliance forces why do you blame solely the US?	Secondly, America must plead guilty in more recent such cases among alliance forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and among civilians in these countries. They all fell victims of illegal American tests of new types of nuclear weapons there!! The fact is staying hidden from rest of the world.
1	Say hello to my little friend! We the people, through our State Governments!	Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox today threw his support behind the National Rifle Association's challenge of a City of Chicago ordinance banning possession of most handguns by filing a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court.Cox's amicus brief -- a document filed in court by someone not directly related to a case -- supports the request by the NRA to the Supreme Court for an appeal of the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in June favoring the City of Chicago.At least 33 other states support the NRA's request for the court to hear an appeal in National Rifle Association v. City of Chicago.
0	as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'.	you didn't answer my question.....toe says all structures evolved by small, random modifications. surely, then you are not saying that whole structures such as feet formed complete...that would be a contradiction now wouldn't it.....so answer my question: what about the feet? which foot came first? there are more to feet and other body parts besides bone...muscles, tendons, toenails....did all these evolve at the same time from the same mutation?...if not, in which order?
1	making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists, with no real knowledge of their situation? archie has no problem. but when it comes to christianity, the obfuscational ploy of 'i don't know all the details' comes out, followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details. she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so. the bible lays out exclusive reasons for 'divorce'. this isn't one of them. this is yet another example of religious intolerance, even to the extent of violating their own religion.	well i was going from the guardian article which was rather more in depth on the specifics. the guardian in particular his ex-wife's ultimatum seems to reduce their 19 years of marriage to a sham (for lack of a better phrase):

Or is that just your style, to avoid any questions that might make you think, keep twisting everyones words around, calling them gun haters and racists, and making yourself sound like a total XXX?
0	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.	Surely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism. Disproving one theory does not prove another. All it does is disprove a theory.

1	Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?	Well, this comes from the same people who invented the death pannels. The truth is that all the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare. Their COST per capita is about half of ours. They have better outcomes.Universal healthcare has been tried in many places and it does work. What does not work is our current system. Wellpoint has just increased premiums by 30% even wiyhout a reform bill. They spend 30% on administrative costs.BTW, do you oppose the bill that would force them to limit the administrative costs to 20%?

You said in one post you are a ex-christian. If you new anything of Christianity you would know this is not possible.

For God sake the pope is a nazi and a fundie.Marlene Elwell, the nazi *itch, who put the evil mariage amendment on the michigan ballot is a Roman Catholic also. If you are a christian and you believe in the suppression of homosexuality then you are a fundie and a christianist.	Where'd you get the idea that Vitter was a Fundamental Christian? He's a Roman Catholic, just like Ted Kennedy. Does that make Ted a fundie, too?emoticonXConfused
1	The Pastors are claiming themselves as a "Spiritual shield" against witchcraft. Of course you don't need such a shield until you find a witch, guess what happens next.	I have been in several 3rd world countries, and I have never once seen a case where someone would be killed if they didn't convert to Christianity, or even if they did convert from Christianity to Islam. On the other hand, I have seen a number of cases where Muslim family members who converted to Christianity had to flee their family out of fear of death. I would be very interested in reading about or hearing about cases where the reverse is true, but I don't think there are many such cases out there. The issue of witchcraft among Christian churches may be an exception at least to the degree of people and children being ostracized.

0	Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.	Why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when I offer my vote/opinion, I am imposing something evil on you?
0	Yes, it is very hard, even for theologians, to explain.	See, here you've seperated mind, spirit, soul. The bible didn't do this, unless Zechariah is being misinterpreted. It basically said, in your interpretation, that the spirit and the soul are the same thing.
1	How do you know it is him? It's a simple question. IF he is writing as Lurch, and someone else comes onto a board, as Ungerdunn, who is just as rude (which is what you are saying), you assume it's the same person? Or, is it because they both claim to be biologists? I guess that having another person enter a forum, and claim to be a biologist would narrow it down to just the same person emoticonXClown All you've done is said you know it is him because one writer is as rude as the other... and that this gives his identity away by some mysterious process, probably I don't understand this as I've never read set-theory! emoticonXWow What should be a very easy question becomes you repeating "I know it is him".Also, has he been banned as Lurch on these other fora?

1	huh. explain why you call people bush haters and use personal attacks yourself when you're running out of ammo? oh yes, it's because you're a hypocrite. i'm voice of treason, i can call people all the horrible names i want, but the minute they say one bad thing about me, i whine like a little girl about how it;'s so unfair and how they are meanies!	why do liberals always resort to personal attacks? why are they so angry? oh wait i know why.......republicans control the presidency, both houses of congress, and most governorships..... i guess i would be angry to if my party was so far down the food chain...... :)
0	how can god be there before time? you can't get before time, as the concept of before is irrelevant without time. even at the very beginnings of the universe time was not one of the curled up spatial dimensions.	^^^^..not exactly, but close. also i said, 'god is sorta like time...', but not exactly. god was here first.
1	Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. Quick search reveals NO mentions at all. Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical.	No, it has not, despite what you and your girlfriend say. And, whether it supports my POV, as I believe it does, is not the point. The point is that my POV is valid, scientific, and becoming increasingly accepted, while your darwinist boat, riddled with leaks and worm holes from day one, is finally being allowed to sink to the bottom without further plugging up and bailing out
1	I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us.   (Alan Keyes, the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama. The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack. Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to "represent" NY'ers. Yeah, look who's the hypocrit now.)	Next thing you know, we will be labeled "domestic terrorists"...heavy sigh emoticonXDonno
1	Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.	NOTE: When I say beneficial mutations, I am not talking about a gain of new genetic information to the genome. The organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i.e. the loss of a function, for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive. If they had wings, they may be blown into the ocean and drown. Over time, you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection. Not evolution. Which also fits beautifully with the creation account.
1	Even then, your statement does nothing. They aren't "getting themselves pregnant". A doctor is doing a medical procedure, that may or may not result in a pregnancy (ya know, those little sperm thingies?) emoticonXAngel	The number of people that do this is irrelevant, alls that counts is the very fact that it happens, and so it invalidates the the sweeping statement that suggested otherwise.
0	What are you talking about? Please define information. What does "new" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism.	In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information.
1	No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word "prayer?" Why not?	Lurch:So scientists are the ones who define everything?
0	When you have no constructive comment just attacks the messenger with your insultsand name calling.....typical...............so very sad..........Its radicals like you that hurt the cause of gay rights.........	Homosexuals are attracted to adults of the same sex.Pedophiles are attracted exclusively to children.There are people, such as the case with these priests, who molest children, who are not pedophiles. Molestation, like rape, isn't about sexual attraction. It is VIOLENCE. People don't molest or rape because they are so turned on they can't help themselves, they do it to HURT somebody.Get some information before shooting off at the mouth VOR. Most of those priests were probably niether gay nor pedophiles. I HATE IT - when people spread this ****. It is FALSE information that does nothing but HARM. It puts blame on the innocent while the guilty get ignored and children get hurt.Do not use this lie to justify your bigotry - for you do so at the cost of innocent people - adults and children.
1	point me toward the right way then? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs. please tell us how creationists were wrong. i would gladly like to see you try!	Hey, let me jump in on this one.Creation science has found nothing. There are no ifs, buts or maybes, on this one. Creation science is wrong and has been proven so by the scientific community time and time again. Look at pretty much any post on this forum and you will see this. Every time a Creat brings up an argument, the secular residents of this site beat them down with logic and reason.No Creat argument has stood up to the test of science. Pure and simple.
1	Yawn, again you keep repeating this. You not only refute yourself by providing an example of knowledge of the unknowable, but you gave an example of what is unknowable, by telling me I'd never be able to know you!	You have claimed god is real, and unknowableTo claim knowledge of the unknowable is self-contradictory.
1	Well, if you combined his plan with all the others, then make all the cuts at once, you would be like 25% of the way there!!   Come on, Steeeve...we have limited material to work with here.....	Why did you even bother reading the proposal? Frankly I saw a rabbit in my yard yesterday and found it a lot more enlightening than what Obama thinks is a good idea.I got to "4 trillion over 12 years" and decided that was enough. For those who are divisionally challenged that comes to under $350 billion a year in "savings" when our deficit is about 5 times that THIS YEAR. Obviously in 12 years that won't be that much. So who cares what else it says. Don't waste your time.
1	Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders.	In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders.

0	So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?	And for decades, evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the Book of Life….they said that individual genes controlled individual traits. Well all that came to a crashing halt when the Human Genome Project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale. Instead, to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists, they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes – over 100,000 short of their estimate. This meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped.
1	Did you actually read it? I suspect not. Did you think that I wouldn't? I suspect so.

I suspect so.	...humans evolved from ape-like ancestors that lived in Africa 5-10 million years ago
0	just a question, can someone show me where symbiote posted at all on the thread?  4forums.com political debates and polls - search results he's got 4 posts in the past day. none of which are about what cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08 says they are.  sorry giantorio for cluttering the forum. and thanks cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08, you just proved my point. when i prove you are wrong, you just change your argument and insult me for failing to prove your new argument you just created. you did this as yankee fan on lw. you did this here as cashburn. you're doing it again as roesgen08. same exact story.	no, not because it was a troll thread. i said no such thing. i said i was reporting the thread for the admin to look at the posts in it because it was filled with spam between o_c and archangel due to archie and o_c's ongoing feud with one another. i said i'm sick of both of them and their bs wasting badwidth on the fora. i said nothing in the positive nor negative about the thread itself being a troll thread - just that it was filled with their spam from their lover's spat. - - one would think that someone (such as yourself) so concerned about people posting truthfully about other posters would do so in their own posts.........
1	I still haven't seen an adequate rebuttal to this. Why can't people marry themselves if they are in love with themselves?  I must have missed your response.	And if gay marriage is legalized, what's to stop people from using the same argument to legalize marrying animals? Or themselves? All they would need to say is "come on, everyone thought gay marriage would lead to the downfall of man, but it hasn't, and neither will legalized [insert marriage concept here]" Your argument is evidence of the gradual process you purport not to exist.
0	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.	So with that, it's also pretty easy to imagine that there was no NEED for the human genome to mutate to accommodate a fruitless/vitaminC-less diet. Likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning.
1	oh no you didn't! not g earnst website?  oh yes you did! that would be like me quoting from nato's website.  po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie  potomac river humm.	'what is missing from public consciousness is that the rulings of the courts starting with parker in 2007 are devastating defeats for the gun rights core doctrine that the purpose of those gun in private hands, outside of the knowledge and reach of a governing authority, is to maintain an anarchic balance of power between a privately armed populace and any and all government. the political leadership to carry those rulings forward does not exist.' second amendment, gun control, the potowmack institute i'm a bit confused. it seems like the supreme court has taken a much more moderate position on the issue than people like you typically advocate. perhaps you could clarify. what gun laws do you support?
0	Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max.	I see far to many religious people that know absolutely nothing about the universe they live in as a result.
0	that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. were is the biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created. in fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. it is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat. pride caused the fall of the son of morning, not scientific discovery.	no! i think that's god's work, and man once again wants the power! by the way how did lucifer become the devil???anyone?
0	The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.	why not?Life is cheap and I hold no silly notions.Science should be used to benefit life, not ignored.
0	Umm.. again they are identified as Messianic Jewish. Google 'Messianic Jewish' if you care, thousands of hits. So you now try to personally misidentify this 'Jewish' group on your own terms? A Messianic Jew is a Jewish person who believes that Yeshua (Jesus) is their Messiah. Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post. You seem to be inferring that I am suggesting that such 'change' means a change for ALL Jews, sic, obviously I am not suggesting that.	Can you tell me where in the New Testament it says that the Sabbath has to be done on Sunday? It's traditional, because of what was adopted by the Catholics, and kept by the protestants.. but.. is it biblical? As for that web site, let's look at it's  Statement of faith  This is very very non-Jewish, and very very Christian.
0	In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use "his/her" or "he/she"... it just gets tiring after a while...)	I agree, no oath should be taken lightly. However, I believe that a certain amount of interpretation is essential, especially in grey areas that medicine can wander into. Abortion to save the life of the mother is a grey area that doctors have to wrestle with. Separating siamese twins where there is only one heart, allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area. Following an oath such as that to the letter puts things too much in black and white, when a lot of good medicine happens in the shades of grey.
1	Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so "self-confident" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.	The logic of Dawkins? Do you think a blind man can make a watch?If you think he can I am not surprized that you think Mr. Dawkins has superb logic. Do not learn from him if you want to retain your sanity.
1	where did that happen, in your dreams? please note the word ' extreme'. extreme lefties have been just as blood thirsty as extreme righties.	lefties kick out the nutcases with the guns and bullets and the lust to kill. then, we let all the remaining nutcases gather in their own corner so that they can babble amongst themselves.
0	Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible. I hardly consider a 1500 year old book "making clear what he wants". Particularly given that even among those who believe the book, they still can't agree on what God wants. And of course, that doesn't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible. You may personally believe that you know what God wants, but if so it's not because God has been clear about it.	I would say that if a diety can't go out of his way to demonstrate his existance and make clear what he wants This may surprise you, although we cannot observe not test this, God has come down to Earth many times throughout human history.
1	That's like looking at a rainbow and insisting it only has the color red in it.	That's where you and I differ. See I view human sexuality as being the exclusive province of the monogamous heterosexual marriage bond.
1	then why have you attacked kerry and other democrats for voting aganist abortion bills that did not have such clauses?  oh yes, i know why, because you're a lying hypocrite.	i think it goes without saying that any time the mother's life is endangered then and abortion can take place............ as far as rape and incest if and abortion has to take place lets hope that it is before the last 3 months of the pregnancy........
0	d. adams? :)  this is, of course, an entire debate unto itself. i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere. but that it's probable? we simply don't have the data to make that leap. we've got some good theories about how life started here, but we don't know exactly what happened. and even if we did, we don't know how common those conditions are 'out there'. if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years, and for all we know they might be, than we may well be the only life in the universe. logically, we just can't say. we don't have enough info to apply logic to the problem.	space is really, really big, so big it bigger than you can think of big.  in addition, the building blocks of life have been detected all over the place. that is water , carbon, and hydrogen, and amino acids.
0	Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment.	Capuchins? The monks?  http://www.capuchin.com/      Are you saying monkeys are smarter than monks?
0	Depends on the usage. Generally, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population.	Does the term "evolution" refer to ONLY the "advances" of life over time?
0	You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt.	Common sense says that if we are all on a downhill slide that mutation/selection – being the conservative/degenerative devicees that they are -- could have never have explained the origin of anything. Our genomes could not have arisen spontaneously. Instead, our genomes were designed by a designer.
0	I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood	My point wasn't to show that the unborn is a person but to show that the real question isn't "Who gets to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy, the woman herself or some nameless faceless bureaucrat?" but whether or not the unborn is a person.
1	wow, there you go again. first we can cut health care costs by hiring lots and lots of doctors and nurses and building lots more hospitals... which have to be, you know, paid for. now we can cut postal rates by hiring lots and lots more delivery people! who have to be, you know, paid. in your view it seems that any cost can be reduced by spending more money... it's fascinating really.	this is more about efficiency than effective because of the coercive monopoly. ups and fedex would hire more people where they would be able to cover the vast plains of the united states. the private companies would have more opportunity if the ban on private companies would be repealed.
0	This is the most asinine argument yet. The man was making six figures as a radio talk show host. Why would he leave that job to hit the road for 18 hour days away from family merely in the hopes of hawking a few extra books? He had an ESTABLISHED platform to sell boks viz a viz his radio show, his frequent substitutions on other programs, and his status as a darling of the Tea Party. The man could line up paid speaking engagements to hawk his book. Why would he trade that for unpaid speaking engagements to hawk his book?	und the country using those talking points without any actual knowledge of what he's even talking about, and when confronted with the reality that he knows less than a rock about any given subject... well that's just stupid.
1	You would say that, because you are neither a woman, nor gay. Families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist by the way, and women and children had few rights. The family structure was "secure" that way. Yes, the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage, is just such a good thing in and of itself. This meant fewer people burning in hell, which is what is really important.emoticonXRolleyes	300 years ago . . . well let's see--lower teen pregnancy rates out of marriage, a tighter and more secure family structure, a LOT less pollution (in fact an environmentalist's paradise), much closer to a libertarian culture, etc. I wouldn't want to go back to that time, but it definitely had it's pluses.
0	Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.	It has been addressed several times on this forum and the best evidence available shows that effect B is greater than C.
0	In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic "mutation" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained.	As far as I can see, Evolutionists agree that natural selection is how we have evolved for microscopic life forms. To me this means that a single organism in a species mutates, giving it and its offspring an advantage over the rest of the population. If this mutation is random doesn't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as, in the long run, only the offspring of the mutated species would survive?

0	One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies.	a bump of the topic. it seems that any evolutionist with any knowledge of this topic has either quit this board or been banned. yet there is no response by creationists. why is that? is it that garioch is correct? is it that creationists are making assertions without understanding what they are talking about? if creationists are talking from a position of knowledge then there should be a creationist discussion of gastralia, their relative position to the sternum, the ossification of the sternum, the presence of a carina, and so forth. the continued failure of creationists to respond with intelligent discussion demonstrates their ignorance of the topic. therefore, any creationist assertions of the status of archaeopteryx must be considered as unfounded.
1	I would argue against this but I would need to introduce subjectivism into the argument. lolemoticonXCensored	Murder without pain is still murder. If you pour CO2 into a babies room while their sleeping they probably won't feel anything.Biologically the fetus is an individual human organism from conception, I don't think it's about consciousness or awareness because a newborn probably isn't aware of much, it's all really conjecture what they understand, and none of us remember. It's the principle, not whether the organism is sentient at that exact moment, but whether it as a category (species) is sentient.A sleeping person doesn't lose their rights because they can't pass the mirror test unconscious.
1	Are you kidding me?! You think that blacks living in Third World Carribean and African countries are "content?!" They're starving by the tens of thousands per day or living so far below the poverty level that it's unimaginable. Maybe you should wander off the beach sometime and see for yourself.	see for yourselves. the fact remains that in the caribbean, the small towns and the pre-invasion african countries, poverty and crime was near nil. yes criminals existed, but not in the rampant way we see today. and yes people had no money, but everyone was self-sufficient and contented with the standard of life. there were no huge social gaps like there are today.
1	But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?	In Genesis, humans are created seperately from all other creatures, but apes and monkeys are not specifically mentioned.
0	You can do so, and if I don't check your source I guess I'm SOL, eh? I've seen the story many places, but this is beyond simply a site dedicated to outing Bush since its a radio show :P	All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past. If you wish others to take this seriously please produce some relevant evidence from a source that held to a higher level of credibility. By your standards I should make a thread based on the National Enquirer or Star about Kerry's life as a male gigolo or golddigger.
0	They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?	I see no duplicity between the two.
1	Functioning? The fetus breathes freely? It cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable? It demands attention? It smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it?  Wow! Didn't know that fetuses were that active and functional.	i don't know if you read the last part of my post, but i'll repeat it more clearly. a baby is always reliant and demanding of another person's care. a baby outside of the womb still depends on its mother (or somebody at least) to consistently keep him fed, to help him sleep and to change his diapers. a baby can stay alive for a bare minimum of time outside the womb, but it still needs care. viable may not be the right word for you. maybe i should say as 'genuine' a baby as the newborn. and you're correct when you said: ''the probability is progressively less with each fewer number of weeks.' but that only makes sense when the womb is empty. when the womb is occupied, it is occupied with a living functioning baby.
1	funny how all those previously plentiful miracles, burning bushes, and personal appearances dropped off so suddenly 2000+ years ago... innit? enquiring minds want to know. non-enquiring minds don't want to enquire.	i wouldn't. think you can arrange it? i mean i'm not asking for anything more than a personal appearance.  something allegedly granted numerous times in the bible. call me thomas.
0	Well you don't need to doubt it. I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need.	Granted these are all not necessarily plausible, but never-the-less they are just as plaussible that the dog was subject to a random bout of evolution.Further, you said..."Just to show what my personal feelings are on God, if I seen him appear in the sky right now and waved at me, I'd drop all my previous ideas and accept that he exists without hesitation."I doubt it. You'd go over what you had that day and see if there was any contamination in the food - or you'd say you were suffereing some other sort of thing that you could rationalise away they mystery of this event.
1	And you offer none for your's. Heteros engage is risky business as well. Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage.   It's not just STD's, it's all sorts of physical issues as well. Cancers, hepatitus, bacterial infections, that result from anal and vagina sex. Add one word and BAM, it works aganist you.	Thats what I thought..... no defense for your perverse behavior.
0	Very well said. However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected. That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights. However, safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense.	It worked just fine for the first half of the 20th century.And training should never be a requirement for exercising a constitutional right.
1	Don't get your panties in a wad, 38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control this clown can dream up.	The Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer of the nation, is "the enemy", but this is not paranoia. Can an immigrant commit treason?
0	How do we know anything for sure? We can't be certain of the Earth's age in billions of years, but we can use carbon dating to figure out it's older then 55,000 years, which refutes creationism.	#4 - How do we know without a doubt the world is billions of years old?
0	Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us.	Global warming may or may not be the result of what humans are doing, although it sure isn't helped by our destorying the environment. Now the increasing amount of natural disasters worries me a lot more than global warming which doesn't seem to be progressing to quickly (from winter to early summer, 136 of 140 days were below average temperature where I live). I could really use some global warming up here in Michigan!!!

0	You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?And to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?Smiley	On this 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, I would like to share my views on the issue of abortion.Life begins at the point of conception. No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue. What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death. Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. What ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! Does the father of the child have a say in this? And what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed. We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.
1	You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts.	I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.
0	So what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions.	Either way, the theory of evolution can explain the DNA change with fewer assumptions.
0	You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience. A discussion about the various methods (and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html	Lack of a Natural Mechanism. Charles Darwin, in his Origin of Species, proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. Darwin defines evolution as "descent with modification." However, Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since "beneficial" mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, "downward" mutations thus far. Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a "Young Earth" than an "Old Earth." Each discovery is a separate "Limiting Factor" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities.
0	I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.	Removal of body parts by whatever means does not change the dna of the rest of the body. The sperm cells and eggs are not affected by the loss of unrelated body parts.
0	Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is "treating them as breeding animals". Kind of an odd thought.	No, it doesn't make it right but it's not right to treat women as breeding animals either.
0	Our side? I don't get the impression we're on the same side.Besides, I think the subject is decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies.	Yeah if we could get a good portion of the pro-life people on our side we might stand a pretty good chance of significantly decreasing the amount of abortions.
1	Wow, what a group of rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error. I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are. That's why the bible say's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God.	The invisible pink flying panda says you're wrong. Prove that it doesn't exist. I take it you have no formal education whatsoever?I take it you have no understanding of science, much less the scientific method? You're just dumb. The age of the Earth hasn't changed in decades. You can go look up old biology textbooks from the 60s and the number is still the same. Therefore either you're lying, or you're being fed lies. Yeah, from 4.5 billion years to 4.500001 billion years. In terms of our lives, that's not important.It amazes me just how dumb creationists are. And you clearly are trying to rely on a attack on science to support creation. Hence why many of us believe that Creationism cannot be defend or supported on its own merits
0	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.  In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work.	You are correct. I did not know that S Africa had abolished the death penalty. No death penalty=no death penalty for firearms posession.    S Africa has the most restrictive gun laws on the planet. They also have the highets murder rate in the western wor
1	O.K. lets' play your game. Gun control has worked exactly WHERE?	I agree with this but you have to remember what works in one place may not work in another and visa versa.

0	Yes California is following European socialism. Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes.	You need look no further than the current state of California to realized that the United States is heading towards socialism just as Europe has in the past few decades. Will the United States one day become a socialist nation? Does socialism work? Would avoiding socialism hurt the future of the US or would socialism hurt the future of the US?
0	Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers.	Losing a fetus should not be a big deal to the pro choice lot on this forum, considering the effort they put into arguing that a fetus is either the equivalent of a parasite or a piece of tissue with no value .
1	Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law.

0	prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator.	when have liberals ever been upset and outraged over a criminal being given a deal? who do you think if offering them up?

0	Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.	To apathy:Call me crazy, but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!! We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model. Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information. An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. So, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? Dogs (varying in hair sizes). What did we get after a short amount of time? Dogs (only the long hair size). There is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. Anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total DNA content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept? His method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability. He is using the scientific method (in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias. This is yet to be determined, however. Can you keep us informed of his progress?

1	But if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. You are a rightwing hypocrite, Archie Baby.	Of course it will have an effect on the gay marriage issue. It will prevent the people of Mass from voting on the issue and place the final decision in the hands of the Pro Gay Democratic Legislature who is owned and controlled by the Gay Lobby. It should also be noted that according to the Mass Constitution, the people have always voted on such issues. The Democratic Party controlled Government wants to change the Constitution against the will of the people who want to vote on this important issue.It's just another example of the Liberals hijacking the historical political Process and reforming it in their own image.

0	this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional.	true. it would have to go through the lower courts unless 'fast-tracked'. scotus could rule that ffca isn't applicable because it is a license issue and not a statute. that's the sad state of affairs that exists today. we can't depend on the scotus acting in accordance with the constitution. emoticonxmad  imo, the creation, by an activist scotus, of a phantom right is more dangerous than the loss of that bogus right. if we had a scotus that foillowed the constitution and didn't dabble in legislating, i wouldn't be fearful of 'big brother'. there are 'real' safeguards to protect us from that possibility, so we don't need scotus to 'make up' new ones.

0	It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.	On the subject of analogies for genetic information, would "computer language" (code) be a better analogy?Indeed mutation and evolution *could* be shown with computer viruses.Of course this would require some familiarity with computer code.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language
1	To summarize, since penfolds reasoning has been shown to be both ignorant and short sighted, his only recourse is to offer a trollish quip before skulking away like the irrational philosophical coward that he is. At least you're consistent penfold. emoticonXRolleyes	I defer to your greater personal knowledge of the depths of ignorance.
0	Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. "judicial fiat" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals.	I think this is unlikely under the current makeup of the Supreme Court. But that of course is the fear that many have, i.e., that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat (whether at the state or federal level) rather than through legislative means.

The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for "walking in a mile in another's shoes". Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?	I personally think that abortion is wrong. I think that a fetus is still a baby. I do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother's life is in danger, otherwise they should live with it. They should have stayed away from the causes of pregnancy.
1	And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing. Science should teach currently held theory.

0	this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic	The Christian theistic worldview can account for the laws of logic by stating that they come from God. God is transcendent; that is, He is beyond the material universe being its creator. God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature. Therefore, the laws of logic are absolute. The are absolute because there is an absolute God. The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes, and must borrow from the Christian worldview in order to rationally argue.

0	I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. "Evolutionism" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?	since evolutionism and creationism are both attempting to answer the same question, (i.e., how come existence?) they are mutally exclusive, and if one is true, it automatically falsifies the other. this means that if evolutionism is accepted as true, then logically creationism, and by extension the entire bible, is false. the notion that the bible is completely and uncompromisingly true is paramount to christianity.with all that in consideration, it should be no surprise that christians will do everything possible to show evolution as false

0	You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.	I support legalization of every drug. I'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like "Marijuana will kill you." Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug.

0	I see, when you say "I'm not an expert" do you mean you aren't a climate scientist or do you mean you don't have the scientific knowledge to discuss this?	I would like to see more conclusive data on the subject but most importantly a REAL plausible solution. I'm not an expert but it does appear most scientists feel global warming is partly man-made. I do get a little sketched out when I see scientists are trying to restrict research for those that go against the theory. They may have strong arguments but that kinda BS really blows your credibility.

If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she can abstain from sex. ;)It works!
0	I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the "I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me".So yes, I "a real pro-choicer" agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type.	then why can't a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue is just that a mass a tissue.
0	Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.	It appears to me, that if slavery had been put up to a vote in Texas back before the civil war, and Texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks (which they would have), you could as simply say "Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it IS."
0	marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence.	again, what is this 'social support' you think the govt. provides, exactly? be specific please. simple question. no, the constitutional amendment doesn't address a cultural context. it would keep you from getting the federal benefits--the legal context.
1	oh yes liberal: anyone who disagrees with vor regardless of their political standing. you would call frist a liberal if he disagreed with you, hell you would even goldwater a liberal if he disagreed with you.  i'm going to mentally replace farfignewgin whenever you say liberal, after all, they have the same meaning in your context.  you can support the troops by disagreeing with any mission that is unncessary in terms of security and any mission that puts troops in unncessary danger. explain to me how you can support the troops by supporting a mission that doesn't help america and gets 1600 of them needlessly killed.	so let me understand this from you libs..........you can support the troops but hope their mission fails? emoticonxconfused and if course if their mission fails it means more deaths and caualties........hmmmmmmm emoticonxconfused
1	Yep, you libs would love that. Then you could party on end without having your carnal consciences tweaked, LOL! No sin then no need for a Savior.	What he suggested, I think, was that Christians must evaluate and redefine the Jesus message, stripped of supernaturalism, miracle stories, later doctrine, (etc.).
1	orion's follies: some other goodies from that site... never linked to those specific articles.  but before orion gets too self-righteous, let's look at some ot the topics he considered 'funny' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum: christian crimes - pastor molests widow's boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush's faith-based failure - pastor molest, guns, drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd's 'white ('n' word)'  is this funny? it's apparently real funny to orion. his link also had a pornographic sub-link on the virgin mary, describing her in graphic, profane language.  orion - christ-deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help.	that is a classic post from easyrider! one of his more assinine attempts at intelligent design.
1	Then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. He was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. It was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. He made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. Bush doesn't send kids to Iraq. First of all they volunteer. Second of all, they are older than 18. Please let me know what comments Michael Moore made that you thought were worthy. You might have trouble.	I didn't see it that way at all. Moore handled himself way better than I expected before I hit the play button. I thought for sure that he would be "outfoxed" to use a pun.
0	So now Wiesmann's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree, but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution...

0	i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right.	ah yes, the lies of easyrider shines again.  and here is a link that puts all those quotes in context.  oh wait. easyrider doesn't believe in context. never have, never will http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/wmdquotes.asp
1	Except, of course, the evidence is totally against that. Plus, there is the little matter of infant mortality... and lack of resources.   But hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you.	Families can multiply a lot faster than you think. I'm not sure of the correct time, but there is nothing that says it couldn't have happened in that time period. The incestually conceived sons went out and found other people and married whom they pleased. They could have married a women who had children, and had even more children. Then they could have returned.That area that was so populated was nothing when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, and any people living around it left. Why else would Lot's daughters commit incest to bring forth children?
1	If you can't prove or deal in absolutes, then the basis of your argument, the "absolute" nature of logic, just became pretty shaky.	i can not prove 100% that God exist, the atheist can not prove100% that God does not exist because absolute proof is not posible.
1	Non-aggressive, yeah. That's why it's Israel that's the occupying force in Palestine and not the other way around. emoticonXWow	Simple, because Israel is a non aggressive Country surrounded by 13 very aggressive Countries who not only vowed to destroy her but have combined their military forces multiple times to try just that. That isn't a theoretical threat, that's real.
1	Yes. So you are indeed committing the genetic fallacy. And apparently unaware of the semantic ambiguity of the sixth commandment. Thanks for clarifying.	Ok. you dont have a clue where your morals come from ..is that comprehensible?You are not clear what the sixth commandment means..is that also comprehensible?
0	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.	Yeah, that's generally the conclusion that I come to which is why I see nothing wrong with abortion. I'm probably not going to be killed by abortion any time soon.

0	i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.	so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it? then why are you even against abortion? we are talking about a life here not just a fetus. i believe that everyone has a right to live. no fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother. in the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt. if you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions. what if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion? what is your opinion on that?
0	No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat. To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers. None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing. But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin.	In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.
1	ER, you're doing the God complex again. Sandra Fluke might not even use birth control because she may very well be celibate. Only God ... and ER who thinks he's God ... know.

0	If we bankrupt the country, the war on terror won't be the reason. Wasteful domestic spending is the only reason we have trouble funding the war on terror. We need to get intellegent with domestic spending. We could start with the $7 billion EPA.	Then, how much money should spend on the war on terror? Should we bankrupt the country to do it? Is it necessary to spend so much that we go bankrupt, or is it better to wisely spend the money we have and to fight an intellegent war against terror?
0	Notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question. My bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book, Simpson would not be saying what Toxey wants him to say.	The record already acquired is amazingly good. It provides us with many detailed examples of a great variety of evolutionary phenomena on lower and intermediate levels and rather abundant data that can be used either by controlled extrapolation or on a statistical sampling basis for inferences as to phenomena on all levels up to the highest. Among the examples are many in which, beyond the slightest doubt, a species or a genus has been gradually transformed into another. Such gradual transformation is also fairly well exemplified for subfamilies and occasionally for families, as the groups are commonly ranked.... In spite of these examples, it remains true, as every paleontologist knows, that most new species, genera, and families appear in the record suddenly and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.George Gaylord Simpson, The Major Features of Evolution (New York: Columbia University Press, 1961), pp 359-60.
0	Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts.	By definition, a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation. Now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied?
1	Wow, so Balrogs existed according to the Bible? Whoda thunk.	Job 41:18-21 18By his exhaling a light does shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.19Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.20Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.21His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
0	if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?	and again, it was only written that way in that era to limit the federal government from making laws that give preference to one religion or another; i.e. anothers persons faith could not receive preferential treatment over your own. the 14th amendment further says that the states cannot pass any laws the abridge the rights you have as a federal citizen so a state cannot pass a law either that gives preference to a different faith than your own, the same limitation as the federal government.
0	Well, it seems pretty evident that you have know idea of the meaning of the word theory when used in science.	*Yes, evolution is a theory. Then again, what is God?
0	Umm...thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do.	I disagree I hear it all the time. What are you going to do when science fills in the gaps and such nonsense.
1	oh yes...because mainstream science is concocting one big hoax just to brainwash you. it's a conspiracy of rabid scientists. emoticonxrolleyes we all know you know much more that scientific peer reviewed journals and the scientific method, right? you're scientific credentials?	there have certainly been many times since life appeared on earth that the 'habitability' of the planet has been less than now. i would differentiate between 'natural' events and man's efforts.
1	reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could.	'and why should you, anyway?' -reproduction  - if the person is religious (i do not believe god will send gay believers to hell, not sure about atheists)  - if he wants to.
1	Yeah, so if on my math test, I put "The answer is 7 because my god says so" and the teacher marks it wrong, he's the XXXXX?	They're failing because the public school system is run by XXXXXX.
0	Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.	HOW OFTEN do you see people change their minds based on somebody fighting for "gay rights"?I have seen it, but it's only a handful of times.Out of HUNDREDS of people I've talked to, it's only a "handful of times".Suppose Democrats do pick up the gay banner hard and heavy. Full gusto.What's the effect?I seriously expect minimal.This is going to be a battle over time. Gays got sodomy laws overturned, and the reaction was anti-gay marriage laws and amendments.The SIMPLEST thing, that should have been the most obvious to everyone, of sodomy laws overturned got a "anti-gay marriage law/amendment" reaction.These fights ARE BEING picked and chosen.ROFLMAO!No. We fundamentally disagree there.How long have you been arguing the gay marriage issue.And you state that you SUPPORT equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold-out, right?If YOUR mind can't be changed in all that time, why do you think that we could win over the nation just by having Democrats come out hot and heavy.Furthermore, THINK about it.HOW LONG have we been pushing for ENDA...And we just tried the vote, and it failed...EVEN ON THE ISSUE THAT HAS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORT, the anti-gays are able to stop the win.What do you think will happen on an issue we DO NOT have majority support on?
0	is homophobia an instinct? because i really have no clue where it came from...	maybe homophobia therefore is a normal reaction and should not be repressed.
1	oh yeah so our tax dollars pay for there asses to live in our prisons? no thanks our tax dollars are the ones feeding and bedding there asses	why would you prefer people to be killed rather than jailed away from society so that their harm is neutralised?
0	And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because "we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact.	Gravity is a fact because we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it.

0	Thats true. However, do we not have a state of reasonable compromise at the moment?	Caged reasoning on both sides but yet each faction has a similiar goal; to decline the rate of abortion. Pro-lifers feel that legal restriction to outright criminalization will complete this goal. Pro-choicers feel that the means to control fertility through contraception will do. I believe moderate pro-lifers and pro-choicers can come to a comfortable compromise.
0	I think you're mixing up socialist and fascist. Patriotism is anathema to socialism.	In a socialist nation, the government issues identity cards to all its citizens, to ensure "national security". Anyone suspected of wrongdoing can more easily be rounded up and imprisoned than in a free society.In a socialist nation, the government is the most important entity in determining whether an individual or group of individuals is prosperous or not, if a business is suspected of having links to terrorism, abortion, islam or political opponents, funding can be cut, ensuring high moral standards are maintained throughout the land.In a socialist nation, the government funds schools and determines their curriculum - ensuring that all students learn the appropriate facts rather than controversial theories, ensuring the stability of the governing regime.In a socialist regime the head of state is held to be deserving of respect and admiration from his subjects, ensuring a stable rule - those opposing actions taken by the government are regarded as "unpatriotic" and "appeasers". In this way it is easy for a socialist nation to wage war and ensure foreign nations have friendly governments, where a less socialist government may not have the funding to maintain a high-tech global police force.

But I congratulate you for finally admitting that this is a trolls thread. That is more than I expected from you. And as for me reinforcing your contention about conditional christian love ? I do love you my friend, I just hate what you represent which is why I express my love by correcting you and calling you on your every hypocritical contradiction. emoticonXAngel I am Archangel after all. emoticonXGood	For someone to whine offense and "trolling" in this thread authored by this "troll" and for the same someone to have posted 13 times in this "trolling" thread demonstrates the height of hypocrisy, a vice so earnestly and 'piously' practiced by the religous.In a way I guess your DOCUMENTED hypocrisy x 13 reinforces the contention of my thread: that conditional christian love is hypocrisy and false. Thank you
1	And how do you know what other animals can analyze? Is that another supreme abilities of us humans? To read the minds of animals?	Your question, which has been pointed out already, has a theological basis - God is supposed to have given us dominion over the rest of creation etc. But what separates us from other mammals (if we restrict the question to that class of vertebrates) is reckoned to be "self consciousness" - the human mind that can deliberate upon and analyse its own thought processes.
1	What's your evidence that the Gospel prophecies are "spurious claims"? Seems like you've bought into a scalding case of rational tunnel-vision (or political correctness, if you prefer).	Prophecy can only be validated after the fact when spurious claims are redacted to fit reality.
0	i'm not disputing the numbers, and i'm certainly not disputing the fact that bush won.  what i'm intrigued about is the razor thin margins, to my mind anyway, that characterize the us election system. don't you find it the least bit odd that it's been 30 years since a president received a plurality? waxy	in florida about 7.5 million votes were cast for president. bush has the lead, with 100% reporting, by 376,923 votes. this is somewhere along the lines of a 376,386 increase in his margin of victory in fl compared to 2000.  in new mexico, approximately 700,000 votes were cast. bush has the lead, with 99% reporting, by 12,170 votes. he lost this state in 2000. the last election in which a candidate for president received a plurality was in 1984. ronald reagan carried 59% of the popular vote and 525 electoral votes. today is 2004, approximately 30 years between an election where the presidential candidate received a plurality.
1	the law abiding responsible gun owner who gunned them down did so respectfully, right ? emoticonXFrazzledYou gun crazies are the only ones with a sick political agenda, you ought to be all sent to a loony bin and given water pistols.	It is entirely premature to be discussing this matter for the purpose of promoting political positions and beliefs. It is also disrespectful to those that died and their families to try and capitalize on their pain for a political agenda. No relevant details have been discovered or released yet meaning all that can be had is pure speculation and hyperbole. The simple fact that authorities were able to apprehend the individual before he could commit suicide places us as a whole in a unique situation.
1	What is this "we" stuff? Got a mouse in your pocket? I thought god was going to destroy it...not "we".	It is a good thing. But why must we destroy the earth and 2/3rds of humanity to accomplish it? That is the downside to the end of the age saga which is coming. You can liken it to when God poured out the plagues on Egypt because Pharaoh refused to free His people. That event will be repeated again, only on a world wide basis. And it will be in response to antichrists actions against His people.
1	boy $346,000? i can think of a few $300,000 firearms in existance today. if anyone of them every shot and killed a person, boy it would be sooooo easy to trace it down. so then why bother banning them? using a $300,000 gun to shoot someone is like hit and run in a bright red ferrari in a busy intersection, the cops are going to find you.	the technology is here. we built a prototype of a weapon a while back (mil contract) that was constructed entirely from carbon composites. it is more or less the same stuff that they make the carbon barrels for the 10-22 with. i don't think they will be hot sellers, though, as they need specialised molding systems (single use) and the composites required for the stressed parts is very expensive. the prototype cost 3.4 million to build, with an estimated per unit cost, whould they ever reach production, of $347,000 each.
0	i didn't know that, but i'm not surprised by it. israel needs all the soldiers it can get.  and i disagree with you on the iran war issue. all out war with iran will have the israelis sitting on the sidelines yet again so as not to xxxx off the me allies fighting against iran.	i honestly think israel would be the ones to bear the brunt of all out war with iran..... their zeal is unmatched as a fighting force and their simply one of the best period.... oh and did you know they allow gays to serve openly in their military? guess old mccain missed that memo too.......
1	Being' immune' and being 'less prone' do not mean the same thing.  I doubt that you will become the poet laureate of Dallas if you do not understand words sweetplums.  You are an old camp fruit and a snivelling bigot .  Are we talking daddies? What does an old fruit like you know of daddies?  I bet he's sure proud of you.emoticonXChicken  I wouldnt be proud of having a mincing bigot for a son..must have set his sights low.  Do white men still leave a bad taste in your boyfriends mouth sweetplums?  You are not married ..	behavior dictates risk. some practices are 'more risky' than others. but to say gays are more prone to hiv infection, suggest that heterosexuals are immune, or less prone...which is factually false. role models?? what are you talking about? you don't even know.  old camp fruits? you've lost the little mind that you had.  your daddy is more of an 'old camp fruit', than i ever could be, girlfriend.  and i'm in a monogamous marriage for the past 10 years. i need no announcements. you?
1	You wouldn't. More likely you'll pursue your Wiccan follies until Judgment Day and then wonder what hit you.	Well then, why the bloody hell would we trust your carnal mind to tell us about the things of God, or in fact why would we trust the carnal minds of the writers of the Bible to tell us about the things of God.
0	Please provide the actual estimates of the time required along with the necessary references if you please! How much time WOULD it take with confidence limits please!	Of course the problem here, is there is not enough time to go from Neanderthal morphology to "modern" morphology by way of RMNS. This is why science needs the Neanderthals be a different species and to go extinct, leaving no trace behind. But if modern humans descended from Neanderthals, darwinists will have to admit that the transformation happened nearly instantly.
0	And yet this is what they fossil record shows. There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a "fully developed" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were "totally useless", is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions.	I went about this wrong. I am meaning that it would take millions of years for wings to evolve. During these millions of years, they will be undeveloped, simply masses attached to the dinosaur, and totally useless. When they reach their fully evolved form, they may have been of use, but until then, they could serve no purpose, and help the dino in no way at all, serving only as excess weight, and larger profile, hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement. During the actual period of the wings evolution, they would be totally useless.
0	And once it has begun, which would you rather have?	Two of the things I mentioned (better locks and security systems) have an effect at preventing home invasion. Having a gun does nothing to prevent the crime, it only serves to stop it once it has begun.

0	Abortion is their best choice?????? Yet women deserve better? Why do you think abortion is their best choice?	I agree that women deserve better choices and such, but banning abortion eliminates their usually best choice. Women do deserve better, but how can you say that while advocating an abortion ban?
0	You have any examples of that? Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is.	If only she'd been allowed to have a gun she could have what?   Shot or threatened to shoot someone?     "Boys and girls as young as 10", the story says.    They threw "rocks and eggs" at her house.    They don't kill you for that in England, Texas maybe.
1	Spanking doesn't teach children to defend themselves against violence. It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses. Different personalites process and categorize information in different ways. Unfortunately for many children, this is one of them. :( And unfortunately I'm speaking from experience.	Do you really believe not spanking your children will make them less likely to hit other children? Why? Where's your evidence? I personally want my children to be proficient at violence and know when it is appropriate to use it and when not. To suggest it is never right to use violence is simply not true.
1	Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it.	A third or fourth eye is simply a copy of an existing body part.If it's a FIRST eye that evolved, then that'd count.You can't create anything new by creating copies.
1	so, clive, everyone that believes that god created the earth is an idiot? you need to spend some quality time with some that do and i think you'd change your tune.	that seems unlikely. he gets banned everywhere he goes with his multiple names. he's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing xxxxxx that you get frequenting these boards (i can't say i blame him on the latter point). look around the web though and you will find him elsewhere...
0	Common sense? A collection of human cells as yet not developed enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human being? Uncommon sense IMO. Just the use of the term "unborn" is ridiculous. Are the rest of us the "undead"?	LOL, are you serious? Nobody wants to force their "religiously prescribed morality" on you. I'm agnostic. I don't subscribe to ANY religion.It is just common sense that murdering an unborn human being is wrong. I don't need religion to tell me that. The debate over abortion really has nothing to do with religion.
0	You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.	I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake.

0	I've been posting at least a few times a week. That's a lot more than once a month. I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. I think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked.	Don't you dare try and give me a lecture about cherry picking! All you ever do is cherry pick! You come around about once a month, scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun, and you use that single incident as if it's evidence that there's a serious problem that threatens the entire nation. If that's not cherry picking then I don't know what is. As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?
1	Gee, and in what year did he state that? 2005? No way. 2000? No. 1995? Nope. 1990? Nah. 1985? Couldn't be. Without more information I can give an exact date, but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984, he must have said that at least 21 years ago (and if he said it in the middle of his life/career, it would have been more like 60 years ago!) - he did not know back then what we now know.	Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”50

0	The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .	In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'? The way I read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something. What was truncated?... *more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL...*
0	Why can't you answer questions directly?anyway, I support ct in passing civil unions or marriage lite as I like to see it, but It doesn't confer equality. If it is really equ8al than it would be marrige. Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that, but we don't so far and we cannot ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage.)If it is good for straight couples, it should be equally good for all couples. . No one is more superior. Everyone should be equal. Marriage for all is equals.	So you don't support Connecticut passing a civil union law?
1	wowie! well shut my mouth and watch me wilt!!! lmao. 50times50	this sounds crazy, but my level of shyness i've found has a lot to do with the whether. when it's nice and sunny, i would stand up in front of a million people if i had to, and whip out my johnson, no problems, barely a blush. if the weather's crappy, i don't know, i just get more reserved.
0	Those who set the rules can do with them as they please. It isn't illogical nor hypocritical. It IS illogical to assume you can chew gum if the rule is "you cant chew gum" and the teacher allows one student to chew gum.	It would be bad enough if it was just the teacher chewing gum and telling the students don't chew gum. But it doesn't stop there. The teacher makes the rule no gum chewing in class. Then later that same day she instructs Billy and Sally to chew gum. Johnny sees this and decides to chew gum too, thinking that its ok. Of course, he gets expelled from school for breaking the rules. In this case the teacher isn't just breaking her own rules, she also commands some of her students to break the rules as well, yet still penalizes those who break the exact rule if they weren't commanded to do so.
1	Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???	On the contrary, the Pro-lifers are acting like the slave traders. Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right because of a physical feature is more like the slave traders than everything. Let me also remind you that black people were sentient. Fetuses are not.

0	As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?	There is a right to own property and to travel as recognized by the US Supreme Court.
0	Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals.	Then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system, not with the actual penalty itself. While anyone can accept that a “perfect” judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before.

0	Actually, it's true. One Darwin's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection.	False and that doesn't invalide evolution given how it's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory.
0	And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?	Don't count on it. The number of scientists in the American scientific community that subscribe to creationism is about %5, based upon a relatively recent poll. I will try to dig it up.Also, calling most Kansas residents stupid for voting in Christian Board of Education members is ridiculous. Religious views are almost never even mentioned in local politics. At the most, you see perhaps a flyer that says "Vote ______". The Christians who want to teach Intelligent Design in schools are an extreme minority that the media, in all its story-searching rating-mongering glory, is blowing out of proportion.
0	Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.	obrotion became populer in the 1800 and thats oround the time evoluion became populer. and the lie that the embro has gill slits.
0	so what you're saying is that you can't?  as a political move to satisfy the pro-life constituents that put them in office.	i don't have to do that.........if there were not abortions being performed in the 3rd trimester then why would the u.s. senate pass a bill banning it?
0	Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.	Isaac Newton sought out the hand of God, through science. He is a prime example of what I mean.

0	unkerpaulie, thank you for this explanation. boing! eureka! i have finally concretely grasped what a 'strawman' argument is. creating something that does not exist. making mock, in a sense. sorry, i just have to reiterate the term in my terms to paste it firmly into place in my cranium.	i suggest you wait for someone to make a statement then attack/address it, rather than presuming statements that were not made and arguing against them. the tactic you are using is called 'strawman arguments' and is not an effective debating method
1	And this differs from your cell how? (oh wait it doesn't).	A computer never does anything but what it has been told to do given a certain stimulus. Any real "decisions" were taken by the programmer. Once a certain set of preconceived conditions are encountered, then the machine does what it was told to do if it encountered those conditions. The computer never makes up its own options and chooses its own preferred course of action.
1	hey , i am the seed of the woman too. gosh, does that mean my birth was prophesied? not only that, i am the son of man too!.	you need to study jesus, the seed of the woman.  do you ever study these issues before you bounce out here in the forum?
1	And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true. But that doesn't make mythology true.	That is your right. But it does not make the "Bang" true.

But you have absolutely no answer for what to do when said laws are violated.	We know. Nato regurgitated the same talking point in post 3. Do try to keep up.
0	ooo, the slippery slope argument! always a classic. the right to not be discriminated against based on her sexual orientation perhaps? what part of the dress code was she going to violate? she was going to wear formal wear. it's not like she was going to show up in ripped jeans and a slipknot t-shirt. rules designed to exclude her. their wishes don't supersede her rights.	most schools also have rules regarding the age of those who can attend prom, ie. no freshman or dates over 20, should we end that discrimination as well? what right was she standing up for exactly? the right to violate dress code? right to ignore the prom rules?  obviously the rest of the prom going students didn't want her making their prom into a political statment, what about their wishes?
0	by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god.	i am speaking of the christian church. no offense to folks of other faiths. i am simply interested in what folks of any faith would say to this.  as a protestant, i would say the purpose of the church is to 'be jesus to the world'. individuals within the church are to use their god given gifts for the building up of the body to love one another and show the world what love is. any other thoughts, (or similar thoughts). remember we are looking at what ought not what is.

0	But is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder? It's pretty easy to find information on the FBI and the CDC websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings. People defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership, not the net benefit when it comes to safety. That would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative.	You do have a good point. However, it does not change my mind. We do our best to make cars as safe as we can, but so many people need to travel fast just to work and survive. More importantly, when one gets into a car, they know that they run the risk of crashing.  I do my best to make my house as safe as I can. Firearm possession is one of the means to attain that safety. When the criminal breaks into a home that criminal knows that he runs a risk of earning a chalk outline. Remove the firearms and remove the risk to the criminal. Consequently, ye increase the risk to the homeowner.

0	To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition', sure. But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect.	There are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. All I am asking here is that Archie, you, JP, etc. own that.

0	Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.	1. Are you referring to "Christian" creationism? Intelligent Design? If so, then it's nothing more than a Christio-centric argument. There's no difference between Christian Creationism/ ID and the Wapuri warrior ideal creation myth which focuses on the divine Parrot.If you are focusing on Christian creationism vs Evolution, there is more than one system of creation, and it doesn't necessarily revolve around one omnipotent, omniscient being. It could be an accident as well!What one thing is an obvious fact from History? You are talking about western civilization. Western Civilization's religious beliefs aren't the be-all, end all, of creation...there's as reason to believe in spontaneous generation as there is in Christian Creationism. You can also use any eastern or south american or native american belief system of creation.
0	Iangb, I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims.

0	Well, it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain.	He presented no arguement as to why he thought that this was not mere reflex action. As someone with only a minimum of medical knowledge, I personally cannot tell the difference between reflex action and a true sense of pain. That is true for most of us and seems to be true for this physician. I am left with having to trust scientists to distinguish between the two and scientists seem to agree that one needs a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order to register pain - which does not happen until the start of the third trimester.
1	It was a hypothetical question that has been answered..please try to keep up.	Again, where is some solid evidence of your claim?If, if, if is not evidence.
1	First of all a man cannot terminate tissue he isn't carrying.The father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is.	Happygrl35, the premise from the man's perspective is the same arguement pro-choicers argue, all they are doing is legally terminating a mass of tissue, not a human being. According to pro-choicers, life isn't conceived at conception, so if I man after having sex with a woman and the woman becomes pregnant, she is not pregnant with a baby, she is pregnant with a cell that can "develop" into a baby. If a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the development of a human being, then he too like the woman already has, should have the opt-out option. A woman can do with her body what she so chooses, like she does, however, everyone including women must mitigate their own damages. If a woman who is pregnant with a few "cell clusters" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation. Remember, when the man left after having sex, he did not create a human being according to pro-choicers, if at most he created a "cell". According to pro-choicers, cells do not translate into a human life. A male should have an opt-out period just like the woman, before the cells become a HUMAN BEING.emoticonXHoho God, I love it. Pro-choicers don't even want to live by their own words. I'm trying to understand their position. Its a "cluster of cells", "a mass of tissue", "not a human being", "no heartbeat" "no brainwave therefore, not a human being yet", so if a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the creation of a human being then, like his female counterpart, should be able terminate his parental duty, that he never created, she did. He and she only created a cell not a human.

0	exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him.	in re: the jefferson claim... it's true that he proposed castration for 'buggery.' but... considering that colonial scientists were as ignorant of sexual orientation as the ancient israelites, it's not surprising they drafted such a draconian punishment for homosexuality. jefferson's suggestion, however, was merciful by comparison. and we also know that, having revised the bible by editing out all the supernatural events (including, especially, the resurrection) and having referred to paul (author of the nt's allegedly anti-homosexual 'clobber' passages) as 'the great coryphaeus... the first corruptor of the doctrines of jesus,' that he would likely have been repelled by with archangel's views, on both god and homosexuality. in fact, it's probable, given his devotion to science and reason, that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration.
1	Like you were raised? Looks like it didn't work and now those hormones must be kicking in? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax...their favorite victims? Males.

1	Calling someone a "liar", "fool hardy", "[corrupter] of the truth", and unobjective is considered complimentary where you come from? Odd, but OK, I'll go with it you lying brainwashed fool (hey, this is fun! I like using Archie's compliments!).Actually, my "sick hypothetical" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry "Corrupter! Blasphemer!" and run away. Is this your idea of "witnessing"? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat.	I didn't attack either one of you at all. I just stated an ugly but very true fact concerning both your objectivity and your credibility. And regarding your sick hypothetical, it isn't a valid question at all as its based on lytes unproven third hand slander, so I see no reason to play a what if game with someone who only seeks to corrupt the truth rather than discover what it is. But nice try. emoticonXGood
1	Let's allow same-sex marriage only. Then heterosexuals will have the same right to marry someone of the same sex.	To me it has nothing to do with equal or civil rights.........It is a special right that gays want....They already have the same rights I have when it comes to marriage......They can marry anyone of the opposite sex...
1	Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?	What's the scoop here?It seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the United States because of all the gun happy nuts running around, everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting.Good idea simone, when do you start your training.I understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they're deep. There's also the massive loss of blood; To be sure, the massive bleeding would wash out nasty debris but a body can't stand to lose a bunch of blood.

1	Oh vey! Vat du they say about the U.S. Marshals service committing more crimes than people they have actually arrested for a crime?	Of the court cases that have been decided over 92% have resulted in convictions. Statistically, it's highly unlikely that there will be big deviance from this pattern for the remaining cases. I don't think presenting information that shows that people with concealed handgun permits very likely kill more innocent people than criminals is a punch in the face to the VPC.
1	Does that mean test tube babies are pure and sinless? If so then why don't we just eradicate that whole phase of passing through the birth canal (if that's what IS where we get our sinful nature) and just have test tube babies! Wheeeee!	So, do humans become instantly vested with this "sin" nature as soon as they pass through the defiling vagina of a woman into the world? Is there something about passing through a woman's vagina that defiles all of humanity? Whereas, the fetus in the womb is totally innocent and blameless and without sin? I'm trying to understand.
0	'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.   Secondly, the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to 'myth'.   Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood?   PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post.	that is not quite what the 'mitochondrial eve' hypothesis posits. science. 1995 dec 22;270(5244):1930-6.  the myth of eve: molecular biology and human origins. ayala fj. university of california, irvine, usa. it has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the 'mitochondrial eve' who lived in africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. the human immune system drb1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the old world monkeys. the theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. molecular evolution data favor the african origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. the mitochondrial eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies. if god transported them, we immediately have removed the flood myth from the realm of science. as if the flood itself did not do this already...

I think it was the french who had come to the new world that the governor had lost control of due to their unopposed heathenism. The request was not to save the native Americans from godlessness. The french settlers had gone hog wild.
0	Since when does the fate get decided by the victim? A woman could be said to have a biased opinion on it because she is an involved party. Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision.	Men shouldn't be deciding because they can't get pregnant after being raped. When was the last time a man's life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant?
0	What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes "conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift.	Nope, your argument fails again. Nothing in the Heller ruling suggests that gun rationing laws are constitutional in nature. At best Heller was simply saying that the individual rights nature of the Second Amendment doesn't automatically rule all gun control null and void. But then again nobody was really expecting it to. The details of what is allowable and what isn't haven't been hammered out yet. But I would love to see you try and explain how 30 months in prison, a felony conviction record, and $5,000 in fines for buying two guns in one month is fair, reasonable, tough on crime, and constitutional in nature. Go ahead and try. We'll wait.

You can continue to ignore the history, you're the one looking like a buffoon.	Considering you left-wingers have been wearing out lawyers for the last 100 years trying to get all the vestiges of Christianity erased from our halls of government, our history books, etc., America must have been more of a Christian nation than you will ever admit.

0	Huh? With a 26" barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards. With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500, but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 (1.51 miles).	I don't know about that listed range, however. The maximum effective range listed is 800 meters. Then again that might be wrong and these short action calibers might have a 1,500 meter effective range, meaning that the claimed abilities of the .50 BMG are mediocre in comparison.

0	what makes you think they're not true? jesus arose from the dead. that's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not.  many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale. none succeeded and a number became believers. you guys are playing with absolute fire. if you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. big time and forever. do you feel lucky? well, do you?	for someone seemingly hellbent on accusing atheists of not understanding any other points of view, it's pretty damn idiotic to threaten us with assertions that we know aren't true. this accomplishes nothing besides giving you the self-satisfaction of touting your religiosity so that you can pat yourself on the back.

0	if i'm spamming a petition, then you're spamming paul krugman, darling. and i've put up plenty of rational arguments with citations. you, on the other hand, have yet to propose one reason why single payer is ridiculous. because we elect representatives to do what we say, not what the lobbyists bribe them to do. you still haven't said anything besides 'stupid', 'ridiculous', and 'maoist' or 'socialist', which is usually what people say about the few politicians who aren't on the take. emoticonxgood	well you can thank god for that then, because what you were proposing for single payer was some of the most ridiculous stupidity i'd ever seen. whenever anyone wanted to discuss it rationally you'd just spam the boards with another petition '72% of single mothers support single payer! 84% of single mothers reject raising taxes to pay for single payer! therefore we should go single payer!' i even recall you once berated steve for arguing in his own words instead of linking to a poll to support him. why do you think those numbers are relevant? popularity isn't a magic power that turns bad policy into good.
1	You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.	Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it. It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
1	if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane.

'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?	i don't think that killing people as a form of punishment is setting a very good example to the rest of the world - if the public start to see authorities giving people death penalties, everybody will just think that killing is ok and it will be a vicious circle! the best way to get through to people, i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.

Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm."In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'"The News regrets the error."CORRECTION	Well done Nato!

0	Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another, but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body. They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations' as if that justifies anything. There are things that cannot be morally obligated, no matter the relationship, so the argument tries to prove.	Blood relationships are never based on choice, yet they entail moral obligations, nonetheless. This is why the courts prosecute negligent parents. They have consistently ruled, for example, that fathers have an obligation to support their children even if they are unplanned and unwanted.
0	could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess.	i did say that if birth control failed (condoms do sometimes too, i think their effectiveness is at like 97%, but that's not 100%) abortion should be acceptable. i know some people want to ban the morning-after pill, but i think most people agree that it should be ok, i know i do. the day of conception, there is virtually no argument that the fetus is actually a human life that takes priority over the mother's life, unless they get into a purely religious rant about how the moment of conception the fetus is a human life that deserves the same rights as anyone. anyway, i don't agree with that.
0	People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things.	So if Utah made a law or a governor stated that christians didn't need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws?

1	So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?   If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?   If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?   You are confusing me. Please explain.	mizmax, that's completely different. the infirtle couples who want to have children and are capable of doing so with sciencetific methods may be married. however, infirtle couples who don't have the capability and wont try to, shouldn't. having children isn't a requirement for marriage- it's what marriage is all about.

0	I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The "you believe in evolution" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that.	I don't think this approach is all that new, but I have to admit that I haven't been around as many of the old-school creationists.

1	and mythology. you forgot mythology. for example, the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths. and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed. and, of course, the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology. do you know what logic is? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy, not logic. the myths of noah are not history. and since we are talking about noah, i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed. and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history.	also, the old testament is a testament of history and prophesy while the new testament is a history of the life of jesus, the stories he told, and the letters written to churches about him. comparing the history of noah to a parable of jesus is faulty logic.
1	Ok genius, explain to me how come it is that I dont believe in monsters, in ghosts,in luck,the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, and so many other things that a lot of people believe in, but yet I believe in God.

You believe what you will, and I will do the same, and in the end we will see who is right and who is not.	5 year olds believe in a lot of things. Many believe in Santa Claus, because they have faith. As a child I believed in childish things. But, I grew up.I am sorry, but I don't see the need for pity for rejecting superstition.

That's not self-defence, that's cold blooded murder.It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them. You don't get to take the law into your own hands. Munir Hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street. That's not self-defence, that's revenge.	I think this might be the wrong thread for this discussion. Something like this belongs in the crime debate area, where I'm currently handing Jo his head over and over again.
1	Wow that worked well. Please explain where his logic is flawed in the point he made. You cant, because its not. This just proves how much this "point" along with all your other arguments have "flaws in logic" if you will.	This "point" is just mocking the other poster for flaws in logic.
0	Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.      In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak.	interesting that those three are also the weakest and rarest of arguments when arguing for gun control. in fact, i have never witnessed anyone basing their entire gun control argument on the fact that 'gun owners lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand-to-hand combat.'
0	"Ready to go", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.Barbarian, regarding mutations:There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? .	So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go. Having the built-in redundancy makes this possible without missing a beat.
0	How about getting the government out of marriage entirely? That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry.	On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it's accepted standard in this country?
0	well, i can't say that i'm surprised. just another politician for ya. they're all the same.	remember a little while ago when the quite conservative governor of the quite conservative texas, rick perry, ordered that school girls receive the vaccine that can prevent cervical cancer? given that the conservative mantra has been that this will lead to promescuity, most observers were quite confused by this. now, it makes more sense. according to ap, merck, the company that makes the vaccine, donated $50,000 to perry's campaign the same week that he made the decision. http://keyetv.com/topstories/topstor...053053516.html
1	i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!	you don't seem to want a written constitution either, or at least one that isn't as vauge as ours. i have gathered from your posts that you want a direct democracy, where everyone gets to vote on each others rights. you want the people to be able vote on such issues as abortion, and marriage, you want a tryanny of the majority. any one who wants people to be able to vote upon the civil rights of another is an enemy of freedom.
1	You resort to the Bible, just in whatever way is convenient to what you want it to say. Just like fundies do. Zardoz, the problem is that when you play devil's advocate (which you like to do), you ONLY take a fundie approach toward the scriptures. In fact, you're often more fundamentalist in the way you approach scripture than fundamentalists. You'd make a good fundie, the best of them, I suppose.	To refute your examples of contemorary 'Christians' deciding that violence is a good thing.See, you grasp at what you like WITHOUT resorting to your own bible to support your fleshly desires. Just like Arch does.I counter that and use the scripture (which is good for the education in all things) to show what these 'believers' should have done.Now, if you want to actually study your bible and use contradictorary verses to support your stance, feel free.That'd just support the concept that the bible is self-contradicting.
1	The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot.	you could probably start by not calling the majority of people anti-moral, anti-family, anti-equality, anti-American, homophobes.But thats just me emoticonXRolleyes
1	probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.	Why don't you try to make George Walker Bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroying the nation of Iraq, for murdering tens of thousands of innocent women and children, for causing the deaths of nearly 3,000 young Americans who left behind mourning mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, in some cases many children who will be left to the mercy of our nation's horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their lives.
1	Because the soundbite "survival of the fittest" was coined to explain evolution to the stupid masses.	And where does the macroevolution feature in that combination?
0	Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge).	? They aren't like puppies or chickens, can't get them fixed or make bar b que out of them.

0	Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.	How about the ability to marry multiple partners? Or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage?
0	good questions. its not a condition, i don't agree.  jesus doesn't open the lock to the pearly-gates for some people, he is the gate. do you see what i mean? that's what he said, 'i am the way... no one comes to the father except through me'. i think its like saying you shouldn't put conditions on the way into a house, you should be able to walk in from any spot - and saying that having to go through the door is a condition. why would people not choose heaven? its a hard road.	who wouldn't choose to go to heaven if such a place actually existed? there is no lock on the pearly-gates. that is what it means to be all-loving and all-forgiving as well. i know, you're going to say that people are refusing to go when they don't accept god, jesus into their lives. that is irelevant. you are placing that condition on it again and thus cheapening it.

0	What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842).	Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: "a revolution". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!
0	if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing.	ok, lets use that logic.... to the gay folks i say marry a woman. bet you aren't happy with that :)
0	I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.	Just thought I'd share about secular rights for gays...not "special rights" but equal rights...No, homosexuals do not have the same rights as heterosexuals do. We cannot serve in the military because of our sexual orientation. We do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation.As for the secular rights, I don't think this is right.From a religious standpoint, I've never seen more ignorance, hatred or twisted lies put into words as I have on this board from some of the folks who are Christians. Personally, I don't see the difference between what is "good" and what is "evil" when it comes to religion on here. I've seen satanists say nicer things than what has been written here.If this is your idea of what is good, I want no part of it.As far as the two, secular rights and religious rights, it seems that although the constitution has a freedom of religion clause in it, faith based people cannot and will not separate the two out making the separation clause invalid...what's the point in that?

0	What's a "marriage officer"? If that's like a priest or minister, than certainly they shouldn't have to perform a ceremony that doesn't coincide with their beliefs. But if it's a government position, like a justice of the peace, then they should either leave their religion at home when they go to work, or get a job that doesn't conflict with their beliefs. Religious freedom does not give you the freedom to deny freedom to someone else.	They did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it non-mandatory to some extent:"But it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her "conscience, religion and belief."(http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/1...8LCTCSG0.html) At least they've recognized that making officials do that may be infringing on their religious freedom.

0	Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.	How can what did not erode for 100 million years to expose a full dino print, now be eroding only within the last 40?
1	Archie, the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says, every accepted definition of the words socialism, statism, capitalism, fascism and nazism. If we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words, it STILL does not work because the argument is STILL illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it.   Face it. You got pwned. Are you really not bright enough to recognize that?	His reference to Marxism is to say that Nazi Germany wasn't COMMUNIST in that it didn't promote PUBLIC OWNERSHIP of the MEANS OF PRODUCTION as the USSR and CHINA did at the time. Are you completely unaware of the difference between communism and socialism? Don't the socialist countries around the world today allow private ownership of businesses? While at the same time, right now, aren't we seeing our own government promoting increased regulations in overseeing the control of these corporations, just as Hitler did in Germany? Statism is just another word for, and synonym for the definition of socialism. Here is what statism/socialism has done today to the worlds economy.
0	Sounds pretty neat. I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?	I have read the opinions and conclusions reached in several internet entries and I can see how they would largely persuade someone to think that the side-by-side dinosaur and human prints in stone do not exist. However, before you reach a personal conclusion, I would really recommend you visiting the site. Awe is not strong enough to describe the feeling that overcomes you when you personally witness this. I have been there and felt the chill when I saw what could only be prints of very old humans co-existing with dinosaurs. There is hardly a rebuttal that works when one is personally exposed to such an odd and even eerie site. The heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances, the toes. Before the naysayers offer a rebuttal, I think a visit to the Paluxy River around Glenrose might be in order. When you do, I think you will agree that there really is nothing like it. You might even revise your opinions regarding order and origins of life.

0	That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources "until the newborn dies" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.	For this to be a consistent pro-choice argument, and assuming this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 14th amendment there would be necessary conclusions. Those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman's right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life. Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).

Please don't neglect the importance of this question since it lies at the very heart of the pro-life view of the beginning of human rights. If you want women to give up their rights to their own bodies because of the significance of this transition (i.e. conception), then it is critically important that you detail what it is in the transition that makes it so significant.
0	What laws are these that you speak of? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.	the only stupid gun laws are the laws that arent strict enoughlike the law that gun nuts wanted that would allow children to tote around assault rifleshow stupid can you be
1	since when has religion been pragmatic or based upon systems that works?  Obvious answer: never.	good luck. did you read the news report about bush's former friend who taped him regretting his former days of indulgence? what's the difference between age restriction of consuming demon rum and sending 18-year-olds to die spreading democracy? christian morality.
0	well, i'm back from my rejuvenating outing. did i have any epiphanies, you ask?  what, one wonders, could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted, their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived, without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times, and ennoble us in our daily pursuits.	well, my views are probably shaded by my anger of religion, after being under its influence for all of my childhood and a better part of my adult life.  i'm going to get on board my pontoon boat on this beautiful 70 degree autumn day and float out on the lake and ponder. maybe a more reasoned perspective can be found at the lapping of the waves below and in the intense blue sky above.

1	anyone else see the irony? i don't have time to look up my facts, but i'll just say my opinions are facts!  let's just ignore that overall, republican adminstrations have more officials indicted or convicted of state & federal laws. nixon's adminstration alone accounts for many of the republican number (golwater called nixon the most dishonest person he'd ever met in his life). and do we need to remind jim of the ratio of republicans who have gone to jail or been indicted compared to democrats in the past 6 years?  right. strom thurmand laughs at you from his grave.  with a ideology like that, i'm not surprised.	not that i have the time to research this (it's fairly obvious anyway) the blue states tend to send the sleaziest bastards to washington. that's a fact. you can count the red scum and the blue scum. you'll find the blue scum returned to washington by their constituency while the red scum is continually kicked out of office. i'd rather be a dead republican than a democrat.

1	Oh Blah! Blah! Blah!  What the devil do Comanches know?  The sisterhood and brotherhood of Sioux, Navajo, Iroquois and other sundry tribes.	'white guilt is the biggest flaw in the american psyche', says dr. david yeagley, comanche indian source: comanche_patriot —————————— white pride and white guilt today in the united states and most of the white world, as soon as a white child begins his formal education, he is implicitly told that he should feel guilt for the crimes of his ancestors. guilt for finding, conquering, enslaving, and killing off non-whites around the globe ... and littering in the process. this guilt stems not from his own crimes, but from the supposed crimes of other (dead) people of the same race. but the child is never encouraged to take pride in the amazing achievements of his race. more: white pride and white guilt —————————— white guilt, obamamania, and the reality of race supporting obama for president, like supporting colin powell a decade ago, is seen by many whites as the ultimate in white guilt repellent. i don't recall ever meeting any white person who personally felt guilty for the troubles of african-americans. but i've known many whites who want to loudly blame other whites for black difficulties. more: vdare.com: 01/02/07 - white guilt, obamania, and the reality of race —————————— white guilt = black power white guilt is best understood as a vacuum of moral authority. whites live with this vacuum despite the fact that they may not feel a trace of personal guilt over past oppression of blacks. whites simply come to a place with blacks where they feel no authority to speak or judge and where they sense a great risk of being seen as racist. one terrible feature is that it means whites lack the authority to say what they see when looking at blacks and black problems. political correctness is what whites have the authority to say about blacks, no matter what they see. it is a language of severely limited authority, of euphemisms that steer whites around associations with racism. the muteness that white guilt imposes on whites undergirds black power. it lets blacks live inside the silence of whites, and have our weaknesses be unutterable by whites even as they are plainly visible. messrs. jackson and sharpton are enforcers of white silence. and when whites are silent, black mediocrity is no deterrent to black advancement. everywhere that minorities press institutions today as groups, there is an erosion of excellence. the reason for this is that white guilt allows institutions to respond only with deference – deferring to the greater moral authority of minorities by lowering standards, and remaining mute to minority mediocrity, to save the institution from the racist label. so whites have made it socially virtuous to defer and stand aside as institutions erode. the public schools are all but devastated, universities are stunted by ideology, corporations are more unctuous than churches, the media are more unctuous yet, and american politicians – of left and right – speak in barren clichés about all of this when they speak at all. more: white guilt = black power —————————— white guilt...myth or reality? shana attends a big 12 school and is always seeing white girls her age or younger propositioned by black men who get offended if rebuffed. she personally knows of one girl who had her entire social life ruined by a black man who called her a racist at a party because she would not be alone with him. 'he said something like, 'xxxx, you just won't be wit' me 'cause i be black'.' a hush settled over the crowd and a bunch of people looked at her like she was a pariah. the girl ended up going back home when all of her dormmates started harassing her for being a 'bigot'. white guilt is when a white person feels sorry for a person of color to such a point that they sacrifice their own rights, and often their own self-respect in a futile hope that somehow their action will atone for the real or imagined sins of their ancestors. arabs had slaves. as long as the slave was not muslim it was legal. arabs were even the organizers of the african slave trade to the west. yet there is no arab guilt over slavery. the romans had their entire economy powered by slaves. and often their own people were slaves. yet there is no italian or roman guilt. and the ultimate irony about the american slave trade was that many african tribes made raids on other tribes and then sold their human booty to western or arabic slavers, yet there is no african guilt. why white guilt then? one of the reasons is the media. more: queen of succubi presents white guilt fact or myth? —————————— white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever just recently, after declining a funding request from one of chicago’s numerous beggars, i heard a most peculiar thing. the man yelled at me as i walked away: “i’m sorry i’m not white.” at first i assumed he was talking to someone else; then i saw that he wasn’t. his tactic must have been an attempt to shame pedestrians into giving him more change. presumably, as the man did not look like a novice to this ancient profession, it must be a strategy that, with the exception of this occasion, works, which tells us quite a bit about the psyche of caucasian americans. more: american renaissance news: white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever —————————— the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade one of the many weapons which our opponents use against us, and also against others of european ancestry, is often termed historical white guilt. those who hate us point accusingly to our empire, and to our involvement in the transatlantic slave trade with the implication that we, particularly the british and european americans, are uniquely guilty of crimes against other races. they believe that, by making us feel guilty about our past, we will be less inclined to object to what is done to us on behalf of our alleged 'victims'. more: the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade | national policy institute here is an accurate depiction of white guilt at work every day in north america and europe. .
1	So what you are saying is that the actual purpose of prison is to be raped in the shower by some 400 pound guy called Betty? Or brutalised by a guard with an inferiority complex...and these don't strike you as cruel and unusual?	I agree entirely. Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.

0	Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims. PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.	IM2L844: The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved.
1	Cool I want to be free of the regulation that I wash my hands before preparing other peoples food. After all it should be my choice to wash my hands after going to the restroom and I should be able to make that choice without restraint. In your world there are no courts, police, or governments to hold me accountable for killing someone or giving them hepatitis.	When I say freedom I mean especially the bolded definitions. Most precise is the philosophical definition #17. 17. Philosophy . the power to exercise choice and make decisions without constraint from within or without; autonomy; self-determination. Compare necessity ( def. 7 ) .
0	religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected. why? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes, unless you are a black gay. it is the way each class is treated that is the same. coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people. the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth.	as explained the last time we crossed paths matthew, there is no evidence presented that would suggest homosexualism is in any way a legitimate aspect of life for differentiating one from another. simply because you possess different sexual ideals from someone else does not mean that you and those like you are worth special consideration by society. your continued comparison of homosexuals to blacks does nothing to make your point anymore valid.
1	I dunno. Those Priuses are so small inside and out. How much explosive compound could Hasan fit into the thing and still be able to get in and drive it?	Being a proud owner of a Prius, I can't help but wonder how much that would cut into the milage :) Let's see, light crowd, medium or heavy. Surely it would do better than anything else...wouldn't it :)
1	So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?	But one idea that makes me hesistate to be pro-choice is an analogy. Imagine a hunter who sees something moving behind a bush. It could be a deer, it could be a human, or it could be something else. The hunter lacks the information to know for sure what is behind the bush. What is the ethical policy for a hunter in this situation? It seems clear to me: if you are not sure it's not human, don't kill it.

1	child, your assumption is not only simplistic, childish and patently ridiculous, but it is coming from you so i'm not surprised at all that you're making it. you can deduce and somehow read into my rejection of your statement being evidence of anything is claiming that christianity is the only religion, but i made clear above that my only intent was to show that your claim that your siggy proves anything at all is patently absurd. but make of it what you will. i'll give you the last word to spew your lies and delusions about what you want to say i believe. so have at it little boy, er, i mean, child. emoticonxbye	wow. talk about mental problems in a can... not the issue. you claimed my signature isn't valid and proves nothing. therefore you must disagree with it. therefore if you disagree with it, you consider that christanity is the sole religion on the planet.  irrelevant.  you disagree with my signature. therefore you believe that every other religion except christanity is not a religion.  i suspect you don't actually believe this and you're just trying to cover up for your giant cockup. if you actually believed that christanity was the sole religion on the planet, you'd have no problem walking into a mosque or a synagogue or a temple and saying to all those believers that their religions don't exist.
0	deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said. You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought. In fact, some of the cited refute such claims.	Have you lost your mind? I got no idea what you are talking about.
1	You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican.	Would it be the lawless Cardinal Law officiating at one of the funerary masses for JPII and otherwise serving in a prominent role in all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the pope's death?
0	i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.	bryan makes a good point though. bloomberg is basically trying to suggest that if we got tough on gun laws here in virginia that the crime rate in new york city would go down. this is pretty doubtful. you never really see someone go 'man, i'd xxxx your head off but guns are too expensive'. instead, people are just smart enough to get guns where it is easiest. should those 10 states suddenly become the hardest states to get guns in than you'd see 10 other states be on that list with the exact same crime rates. the reason we can tell this is that virginia and those other named states do not have higher crime rates than the cities with strict gun laws.
1	You actually have some full insight into gays and what we have gone through and think were pathetic. Once again insults and a bigoted view Archie. You never cease to amaze me.	The term GAY was adopted by the homosexual movement in the hope of evoking a happy existence and persona to the general public that rightfully saw your community for the pathetic self centered existence that it still represents. You may have bought into that image lesz, but I can plainly and clearly see the full extent of the misery index which comes with the homosexual lifestyle. So your claim that your perceived, promoted and alleged happiness as a people is as foolish as your insistence that homosexuality is as right and normal as heterosexuality which is the reason our species is self perpetuating.http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1...229518,00.html
0	i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?	not all reform jews are liberals either. i know more than a few conservative reform jews. also there are fundamentalists of every christian denomination, i've even spoken to people who've encountered fundamentalist anglicans. :p orthodox judaism, as i understand it, attempts to perpetuate the same system of law as was delivered by moses, and more specifically the associated traditions of the last 3-4 millnenia. fundamentalist protestantism, meanwhile, sets itself against the christian tradition, such as the priesthood, apostolic succession, the doctrine of transubstantiation, infant baptism. the point i'm making is the rejection of these doctrines does not make the fundamentalist protestant churches any less christian, nor is the rejection necessarily incorrect, and the same principle applies to reform judaism. that is the comparison i was making.
1	Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases.	Right. And that is the reason for peer review. Creationists don't subject their ramblings to peer review. That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists. Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation.
0	With regard to this statement you have to consider:1. How can anyone know what product an "intelligent designer" wanted.2. Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia.But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants.	An intelligent designer would design a system to produce the product as easily as possible.
1	Based on your irrational rants, you are most definitely the sockpuppet you proclaimed yourself to be in the post above.	Get a clue, Archie. No one is a "self-proclaimed sockpuppet" here.
1	Before you were claiming it was a slippery slope. Now you're claiming it's a strawman. Perhaps you don't understand what either term means.	And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.
1	So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.	Why? Because police cars attached to the Washington MPD's Civil Disturbance Unit had escorted the SEIU protesters' buses to Baer's home. Such cross-jurisdictional escort activity is not uncommon for both departments according to Friz and Metro Police Department spokesperson Officer Eric Frost. Still, the District police did not inform their colleagues of what was about to happen in one of their Maryland neighborhoods.
0	I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.	Personally i don't believe in abortion. It's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal.

0	Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to "polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it." Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it.	Any two adults can run the household, one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated, one inherits when the other dies, etc etc. That parallel does not carry over to group marriages. When one dies, who inherits? If one is incapacitied, who decides what the treatment should be? Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious. If we're talking about legal recognition, and we are (right?), then the cases are wildly different. Our marriage laws, for better or worse, are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household. They also assume man and wife, true, but don't actually depend on that. But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws; changing that is a huge project.
1	to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion.	i would like to add, i don't necessarily agree with the health care reform that obama passed, but i will applaud the fact that he actually passed something concerning health care. all the previous presidents since reagan have promised health care and never delivered. they ran on health care, and once elected did nothing . at least obama kept his promise to address the subject. maybe it could have been a better plan, but what we have now is better than the nothing we've had under mostly republicans.. clinton being the only democrat who also failed to deliver ....
0	Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce "remotely" from Virginia.Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS.	Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely, if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else.
0	i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost.	i'd say a restraint fiscally would naturally cause better foreign relations. hard to make people happy when you attack other countries causing you to spend well into debt thus lowering your economy and bringing other economies with it. and another thing, if i hear just a few more 'i'm more like reagan than you are' then i might have to buy a new tv and explain to the police why my old one is blown to bits in the neighbors yard :)
1	your daddy plugged your hole?? is that why you are so sour. i guess you ate too many beans recently, and that made you full the holy spirit..	then call the police, or whoever it is you're currently whining to, if you don't like it. see if they can help you. do it now? p.s. did yo daddy plug da hole today? huh?  emoticonxbouncer
0	and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance? or for credit cards, for that matter? the cost of a policy, or card, is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer. don't want to pay high premiums, take the risk on yourself. period. i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another's morality. we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know.	this is the root of the problem with the entire insurance based medical system. it is affordable and obtainable for those who do not actually need it, but impossible to get or unaffordable if you can. this is the heart of the debate. a lot of people find it morally unacceptable to let somebody with a treatable condition die in the richest country in the world for lack of care. at the same time in order for insurers to stay profitable, they need to not pay for treatment for people with expensive conditions.
0	But my relationship is between a man and woman. You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that. Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman.	OK, are YOU willing to settle for legal recognition of your relationship with your spouse under federal and state laws as a "civil union" only? You would still maintain the right to consider yourselves as "married" under whatever religious denomination you choose.
1	That sort of warms the cockles of my heart. Namely that some Europeans might be disinclined to visit or stay here. Don't let the door hit you in the buttocks on the way out.	The Patriot Act was enforced for a limited duration, but is subject to continued use if it is re-enacted. I hope it isn't, and if it is that would be a great XXXX to civil liberties in the US.Concur. I worked with a person that had just come to the US from Europe; they commented that for the country that says they're the most free in the world, the US sure did have "a lot of rules for what you can't do".

0	See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.	Diseases used to be ascribed to God and it was thought that those people who got sick deserved to be sick because of their lack of piety. Now we know that diseases strike indiscriminately (where piety is concerned) and affect people only based on their risk of acquiring the virus and their general state of health. There are many other examples.
1	I can understand your disappointment. Its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions. No easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim. But if you really work hard at it for another decade or so you may recover yet. Best of luck and don't fall for the quacks peddling quick cures.	WOW, in one fell swoop you completely destroyed my faith in God. In 109 words you awakened me from 32 YEARS of religious delusions. NOT!!!

0	Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.	I thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage.

For a 13 year old girl that could greatly damage her body to have a pregnancy so young. She is just starting to grow and mature, and its not healthy, natural, or right to have a pregnancy at that age. She could cause alot of damage being that young.
1	Your "opinion" was a kindergarten question outlining a "problem" that never existed, a "problem" that was explained to you 3 or 4 times. How is it our fault that you ask such embarassing questions repeatedly, despite having the answers explained to you repeatedly? How does this reflect poorly on anyone but you?	I just realized it's a waste of time sharing my opinion with you self important XXXXXX who think you have such a grasp on science that you dazzle yourselves into a frenzy.
0	You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean "will", "must", or "shall" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it "CAN" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun.	You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.

1	Well, if you want to tell the truth, the theory of evolution is NOT a religion, it involves no magical deities, it takes nothing on faith.

I simply am stating that the theory of evolution is as much of a religion as the theory of creation.
1	i love it when the left dogs beck but blatantly shows their bias by not covering news stories detrimental to our pot-earred president. ;)	do you even follow the news?? seriously. there have been cases of msnbc being so offensive that even hillary clinton basically threatened to boycott them. geez. as far as huffington is concerned, the site you linked to itself is a good example, and is indicative of the same sort of junk liberals criticize conservative talking heads for. for instance, where were the photos that present tea party protestors in a positive light? why would they want to to take 10 photos (out of no doubt thousands that were perfectly peaceful) that present the worst possible elements they could find? that such doesn't raise a red flag to you speaks volumes.

0	Nonsense, societies change over time, therefore they evolve. Only biological populations evolve through natural selection and the theory of evolution only applies to biological populations, but the term "evolution" applies to other things too.	No, the church is not evolving. Neither is society, language, ethics, morality, or our ability to shop. Only biological populations evolve.
1	No, you shot off a smart remark while failing to address any of the issues. Par fro the course for you. It seems like maybe you would be more comfortable on a blogging page than a forum page, especially a blogging page without a space for reader responses.	Everybody's a media critic. I interject a little sarcastic humor? Oh brother.
0	best interests of the nation as opposed to what? other people outside it? i reject any notion that one nation should be promoted regardless of the effects on others. faithful to what exactly? if an oath makes you do something you wouldn't otherwise do, it makes you a slave. if it doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't otherwise do, it is pointless anyway.	pledging loyality doesn't mean you are a slave, just that you will be faithful and keep the best interests of the nation at heart.

Further, you'd be peeved if you found out that it was your govt. being completely insensitive (not to mention wasteful). The govt. screwed up...if it had been Bush you'd be crying bloody murder.	nonsense! what it is a reflection of is the sense of paranoia that the hard right religious radical lunatic fringe has created ever since 9/11. if you were panicked, suck it up! others have suffered far worse and have managed to keep their perspective. the non-stop drumbeat from the chicken littles on the right is responsible for this and no one else.  cheney on meet the press  this morning is a perfect example of this destructive attitude.
1	well, then again, we all know the kind of people the nmbla consists of. sick freaks, everyone of them. they have their reasons. chinese girls start their period at three years old hmmm? sorry for the skepticism, but i don't buy it. i can't imagine a three year old starting their period. how is a body like that supposed to sexually mature?	nmbla thinks it should be 8. there argument? it is giving the child comfort and will actually help them mature faster. don't believe me? check out their website.
0	most parents today don't buy their kids toy guns and certainly not realistic replicas. why don't you just stop defending unscrupulous merchants that sell dangerous toys in violation of federal law? cops are human, they make mistakes. easy for you, the armchair patriot, to criticize.	if a police officer can't tell that something like this is obviously a toy, then they have no business being police to begin with. first, how is this even relevant to the discussion? second, why should we believe that it's correct? please tell me you aren't counting gang bangers and violent youth as children. in the state of maryland, and dc according to the study. hardly a reliable source for such a survey. again, what's the relevancy to this?
1	And yet the species that exist today are the exact same as the species during the high oxygen content? That makes little sense.

And I'd think the explanation would be that oxygen content was much different before the flood
1	what about God? So many God-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :)  seriously I really don't know much about terrorists. I know that Bin Laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it.	i used to think the answer to this was bin laden, but after reading an article called 'the brain' (playboy's june issue), i switched my opinion to khalid shieikh mohammed. does anyone else agree with me? this guy was the mastermind behind so many terrorist attacks (incl. 9/11) that it made my head spin. it was also surprising to read that he received his bachelor's degree here in the states, with classmates describing him as a 'class clown'. simply crazy, and scary when you think about it. thoughts or opinions? steve

0	So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's "weak gun control laws" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?It seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to America, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons. They've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there, they can make whatever they need or want.	Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- On January 22, 2006, the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan's tribal areas, which has been called "the most dangerous place in the world." A week before that, the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area. They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives. Instead, they killed 18 women and children.One week before that, I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns.Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar. They repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the Pakistani Army had too many "sensitive operations" going on in that region. Without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province), we never would have gotten in.The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi. He was born and raised in the tribal areas. He took care of us while we were there, and he was a godsend. You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms. They became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. Most of the work is done by hand.The vendors are Pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s.These days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban. They purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army.This summer, I went back to Pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations.But at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government.For Pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time.
0	That is a nice little pistol with lots of smack for only 11 onces. Also, I like DA automatics.	If you're after concealment my favorite and regular carry is the Kel-Tec .380.Fits in the watch pocket of a pair of Levis, feeds six hollow points flawlessly and weighs almost nothing. Several of our deputy sheriffs carry them as summer off-duty pieces, which is how I discovered the convenience.
0	why are these murders 'blatant racist killlings'? the article you posted makes it sound like a robbery gone bad.	there still have been no white people demonstrating about the blatant racist killlings of two white men by a black man in florida. also president obama has not declared that these white men could have looked like his sons had he married a white girl( which is reasonable considering he is a half caste) , if fact he seems to have completely ignored this black on white killling. maybe he is a racist
0	an innocent person can be convicted of a crime--i thought that was what the topic was about. just because they are convicted, doesn't mean they are 100% responsible, guilty, etc for that crime-but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system--they are guilty. that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years--they are convicted of a crime. i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics, then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence. okay, everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on--what is it with you people? like i said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.  comprende' ?	i find that laughable. is the state infalliable?  i disagree. at least 23 have been executed innocently, with rates likely much higher.  http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/feb00/current.htm how about the 69 released death row inmates? are you saying that in the past no one has been wrongly executed when we are now seeing dna and other tech freeing inmantes basically every 2 months?

1	So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is.	Actually its not sickening in any way. These kids are at risk and need to know the resources available to them to avoid realizing those risks. Frankly I thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agencies and organizations which they may need to interact with in the future. Knowledge can keep them out of deep trouble. Ignorance will not do so.

0	But you know what really doesn't make sense? Why are they evangelising to people (who they know most of them will reject them) if those people get a special dispensation? They'd be condemning people to hell by evangelizing, would they not? Why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation? emoticonXConfused	I believe there is special dispensation for those who've never had a chance to hear the Good News. The last Pope mentioned something dealing with this a few years ago IIRC. This is also why the great commision for Christians is Evangelism.
0	#2 was questioning the personal, non-scientific beliefs of the evolution believer	1.)Refusing to comment on scientific procedure means absolutely nothing. Maybe we don't have anything to say.2.)Testing your beliefs of your own scientific conclusions is not wrong.
1	What is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?	Okay, here's the hypothesis I pulled out of my rear. Long ago, some females began to wear primordial shoes. The newly evolved shoe-wearing gene was selected for, as females with leather booties were less likely to cut their feet and acquire a deadly infection. This prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among males. Males who became attracted to the booties would be at an advantage, as they would more likely impregnate the bootie women who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm products.Your hypothesis falls apart with your first statement.We all know that it would have been impossible for only " some " of them to have shoes. If one had them, then you can pretty much guess they all ... just had to have them.Now you make no inference to men having shoes. Here we can agree .... Women probably did invent shoes

Laura Bush was simply stunning--there's no other way to put it. She stole the show in my opinion, with her gracefulness and the Oscar De la Renta she was wearing. It was like watching Jacklyn Kennedy all over again. Bush seemed to be having a great time too.The protestors came across looking like total party-poopers on this one, BTW. Like it or not, people were just trying to have fun.
0	Well let me put it like this, I consider it your duty because if you don't protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else. Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government.	I don't mean to get off on a tangent here, but it's our duty  to protect ourselves? Right is one thing, but duty?

0	dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views..	i don't think it's fair to put the blame on women who wear explicit clothing. there are times when self control is needed. if a man can't exercise that self control, to a point where he rapes a woman, then he does deserve jail.  this is partly right though, women do cause a lot of mixed messages when they go out wearing almost nothing. however, if she says no... it means no. and we shouldn't go around blaming the victim of a sexual assault.
0	Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe.	No need to change the verbage:"...individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments."Like folks who migrated to northern latitudes and happened to have lighter skin(variation) were healthier and therefore produced more and healthier offspring. Over generations the lighter skinned came to dominate the group while becomming lighter still. Why is that so difficult? No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced. They just weren't as successful in the long run.
1	I think he is just disturbed because he didn't get his 40 acres and mule?	No it f****n' isn't! If that was the case then Plessy v. Ferguson should have been used as precedent for all the following cases that dealt with segregation and racism. In Plessy the Supreme Court ruled that black men weren't entitled to the same facilities as white men, rather they had to have their own private facilities, separate from those of white men.Forget precedent, the Supreme Court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled.

0	George Bush won the majority of votes (the first majority winner in 16 years) in an election with the highest turnout in US history (>117Million voters). The Senate Minority Leader was defeated by a nobody. Democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the House and Senate, something that never happens in a Presidential election year. This gave the Republican majority in both branches of Congress even more control. 11 Liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins. If liberalism ISN'T dead, then it's in ICU on a heart and lung machine. emoticonXRolleyes	I would like to point out that it was hardly a land slide. Current admninistration is not as popular as either Reagan or Clinton was. This nation is divided. Nothing is dead.

A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns.	it has 'splintered' in the fact there are more than one way to interpret things.. and how strictly one follows the rituals.  on the other hand, there doesn't seem to be the antagonisation between the various viewpoints that there are with chistianity.. although some of the ultra-conservative are a bit snooty.. that attitude is very much in the minority though.

1	And you're baffled that you don't have more intelligent debate with people. I'm shocked.	There is nothing wrong with honest intelligent debate on this issue, but the anti-gun crowd don't bring honest intelligent arguments to the table. The only thing they bring is fear and emotion driven rhetoric without any factual basis.For example, just mention the low murder rates in Canada and Switzerland, where gun ownership is legal, and they scatter like cockroaches.

0	This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?	And I'll bet the formal list of "great physicists" who preceded the development of the theory of evolution is meaningful. I wonder how many of these "great physicists" also believed that night air could make them ill? How many beleived in alchemy, like Newton? I wonder if Newton is in that list? He didn't believe in the divinity of Christ.
0	Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton.	One of the most hilarious ones is the idea that the laws are the "intrinsic" properties of matter. So a piece of stonehas the force of gravity as its own property does not it? This is"mythology" and the worst of it.
0	but why should i care about their emotions? they obviously don't care about mine. this is in reference to the jonestown massacre, where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink (i don't think it was actually kool-aid) laced with cyanide. okay.	i'm not saying you shouldn't argue against their weak moral position. i'm saying you shouldn't assume their emotions are what they would have to feel towards you to still oppose you if they shared your ethical system. of course they don't make one right. as for the kool-aid: i often see this referenced in arguments between americans, i have no idea what it is. i meant according to most christian theological viewpoints that oppose homosexual sex.

1	I was eight at the time. I'll read up and get back to you. Mind your manners.	The Gun Control Act of 1968, which initiated the background check requirement, was written by liberal politicians; the main people who support gun control laws. It was these same gun control nuts that chose to intentionally not require private transfers to involve background checks.You missed the opportunity back in 1968, you have no room to gripe about it now. Shut up.
0	Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke.

Why do you talk past me so I feel like I'm eavesdropping on a post intended for someone else? Are you such a coward that you fear speaking directly to me?
0	Not quite. To be more correct regarding government and guns, the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence.Our political philosophy is very clear on this:"that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" - Declearation of IndependaceYou have the right to try and revolt with violence. You don't have the right to win a revolt.	One of the biggest arguments against gun control is that if the government became too oppressive, the people wouldn't have the capacity to carry out a successful rebellion. Of course, if the government was becoming oppressive, it would likely implement gun control, so the absence of gun control is necessary to ensure that we do not take a plunge towards fascism!
0	How is that a strawman? Your challenge directly relies upon something you assume to be proven, but has not been.

And where, pray tell are you pulling THIS strawman from? emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead
1	Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity ).	How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?
0	i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills.	there are many problems with society depending on which part of society one belongs to. i don't know that i'd call them a series because some are unrelated. there's a serious problem of apathy in education. people don't seem to want to learn.

0	I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress. It's all politics.	So why, in this gun-hater's dream come true of congress, did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law?
0	Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.	Then explain to me why a pregnant woman was hit by a car not long ago leading to the death of both mother and baby. Resulting in a double vehicular homicide charge being leveled against the driver ? How can that be if the unborn child doesn't have rights as a human being ? And why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ? Isn't that a true catch 22 for the unborn, and a contradiction in the law ?

0	are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire.	banks have been lending on 5 times salary for mortgages, when 3 is the sensible limit. the size of mortgages is such that even a small rate change will push many over the limit of affordability. consumer spending is already falling.

'but when them paki bastards come over 'ere 'n start killin' our boys, they can fuck off back to mussy land they can, yeah kill the bastards!' again, no, no no no no! learn to live with each other, this guy did something wrong, he should be condemned, not his whole religion. of course he did wrong and i am not just blaming the racists, it's equally the extremists fault. but all i am saying is, learn to fucking live with each other!

0	Actually, there is no such thing as "an evolutionary mutation of a gene." A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?	An evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed.

They stopped trying to follow the image that was being imposed on them, and instead embraced what they were. That's all that's happening here.

Um, for the record I grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of "wind-driven snow" and it was not particularly pure. A feeble and laughable metaphor.	Democrats are not clean and pure as the wind driven snow, they do not have an absolute birthright to govern, and they certainly are not the only ones qualified to govern!

0	Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).	How about: A woman wakes up to find herself connected to a body. A body without a brain, which is using her own organs to be alive. Doctors are preparing to transplant a brain from a dying violinist into this new one connected to her and the date is set in the future. Would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity, mind, consciousness or existence in actuality?
1	Well, maybe the pistol and the hunting rifle, what do you need an automatic weapon? Have the deer gotten faster?	Sorry my brain wasn't working that early this morning.

Now I think it does get a little extreme with owning several M-16s, but if I want to own a pistol, a shotgun, and some fancy automatic, well that's my right.

0	Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person.	My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, fetus, etc., is a Someone.

Every time I see another story about another shooting in America, sometimes ever two or three shootouts and killings, it absolutely thrills me because I know that the NRA has armed even more Americans and more Americans can now go out and shoot and kill and maim.So, carry on, NRA! I know you're working on that wonderful time when every time a new baby is born in this country, right after a baby takes its first breath, a gun will be placed in his or her tiny hand.
1	Not true. I googled "helpful mutation" and got a nice list of examples. I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions.	The failure to observe even one mutation that adds information is more than just a failure to find support for the theory. It is evidence against the theory. Spetner
0	Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc...	Actually, society hasn't said this. 5 judges, in very recent times, have. I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old. I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the "18 and over execution rule" in the eighth amendment.

0	I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.	Is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax?
1	Ever hear of artificial ensemination? Why is that heteros only think there is one way to produce children? I find hetero sex disturbing,and an unnatural lifestyle choice.

Obssessiveness is not healthy - regardless of what your obsessing over. Also, one needs to be careful about the lable. For example, nt everyone who opposes gay marriage for religious reasons is a zealout. I would say most are not. Take Easy and JP. Both have religious reasons for opposing gay marriage (that should not be the problem of anyone outside their faith, but I digress...), however I would only call Easy a zealot. JP may be an occasionally obnoxious conservative apologist who can even teeter on redneck from imie to time, but he is no zealout.

1	But you are the accuser. I've read the Bible and I have studied religion, more than you can imagine. I have also studied biology, performed experiments and reached conclusions.

What gets me is when people asume that people like myself are simple or have been brainwashed. But the reality is that the accusers are the narrow minded ones who've been textbook (old style) brainwashed.
0	But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the "discrimination" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ... emoticonXRolleyesAnyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess.	Some Iowa county recorders say they have contemplated refusing to give a marriage license to gay couples who walk into the office, but so far none is vowing to do so.“This is putting us in a very, very difficult position here,” Wayne County Recorder Angela Horton said Thursday in an interview. “But sometimes you have to put aside your personal beliefs, your religious beliefs, when you're doing a job you've sworn under oath to provide.”After hearing rumblings of discontent, a state official sent a strongly worded note to all recorders Thursday explaining why they should obey the Iowa Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage when it takes effect April 27.Victoria Hutton of the Iowa Department of Public Health informed recorders that the ruling has the force of law statewide: “All county recorders in the state of Iowa are required to comply with the Varnum decision … and to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples in the same manner as licenses issued to opposite gender applicants.”Republican state senators on Thursday crafted a new proposal that would give recorders an out if their religion is opposed to gay marriage, but Senate Democratic Leader Mike Gronstal scorned it as “blatantly unconstitutional.”State to counties: Obey gay marriage ruling, issue certificates | DesMoinesRegister.com | The Des Moines RegisterWhy is it that people of religion keep trying to seek special privilege for their religious beliefs?Do your job, or get out of the office.Why is it any more special for a "Christian" to have a "religious" belief against homosexuality, as opposed to a NON-Christian having a "non-religious" belief against homosexuality???

It goes along the same lines as doing something evil to achieve good still makes you an evil person.
0	i'm referring to chemist's assertion that mutations cause a beneficial modification to the morphology of hemoglobin. my two links say the hemoglobin becomes 'abnormal,' thus his example fails.  and you are assuming that this mutation is random. why? cancer mutations are not random...they are lead up to by epigenetic changes. why not this? http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-nvo122105.php	to ss, results from new mutations are by definition different from the normal, so your objection makes no sense. no one is disputing that there are serious negative side effects with the sickle cell trait. however, in terms of the reproductive success of families with sickle cell vs those without, the ones with the trait do better overall than the ones without, in areas severely beset with malaria and in times before medicine, despite the negative effects. the positives outweigh the negatives, so the sickle cell trait is therefore beneficial in terms of natural selection.

0	i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?	i think your question should be 'why did god make commandments?' because that's what 'thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet' are? and no, commandments are not designed to help you live happily and without fear. its actually the exact opposite: commandments serve the purpose of keeping people under control through the use of fear.  sin means diobeying the commandments. as for homosexuality and witchcraft, they are sins because there are commandments against them.
0	No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God.	Secondly, I see you are falling into the usual O.P. of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard "n" is right next to "b" last time I checked). Really Phyllis, get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors.
0	i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate. as for my personal take, 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that. do you disagree? prejean should not have lied about it. anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy. seeing some of hilton's work, i don't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody. i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about' is exactly why he was chosen.	wow, foundit is apparently quite the staunch anti-indecency advocate. who knew?? good to know, to pull out in future threads, though.

0	well, signorile certainly didn't back up his opinions in this instance. how do you know it's the truth? if it were definitive, i'd be more inclined to agree. it's not 'common knowledge' that merv griffin was gay, at least not outside of hollywood. i'd never heard it myself. i don't see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were (like having sex with someone of the same gender).  and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 80s is absolutely opinion.	i thought it was common knowledge that merv was gay. it may have been an opinion piece (as are all blogs), but he indicated he researched these facts for a book he had written. signorile is no slouch. he is a respected writer. certainly strongly opinionated, but he backs his opinions up. this is not a fox 'news' piece. how does telling the truth prevent the guy from resting in peace?
0	The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc	I'm new to this idea that science has over-ruled Creation. Please explain.
0	thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression.	so lets see how many other people are being targeted by the inquisition for their faith by the big three. let's see there is naturally me. jp by archie. and now esdraelon (godzilla monster?) questioning romebigred.... so your saying that his beliefs do not hold sway with what the mormons teach? or is it just that when he gives you evidence that counters your ignorance on his religion, your perceived opinion of mormonism is thus null and void?
0	What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent.It's the woman's body that carries the fetus. It ultimately the woman's decision. As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion.	I'm sorry but the baby is a part of both of them.Should it be that the mother decides to keep the baby and the father want's her to terminate the state will still come chasing for child support.Why the father didn't get a say on if the baby was born or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law says so.
1	Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion.	I CAN EMPIRICALLY PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE GOD OF THE BIBLE VIA ITS CENTRAL CLAIMS
0	i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?	why even bother with courts? between the nancy grace's of the world and several other people i have noticed, there is no longer any such thing as innocent. therefore, perhaps, we should just send anybody charged with a crime straight to jail and just save everybody a whole lot of time and money. i was for sure he was guilty. should i put my faith in a jury? should i put my faith in our courts? do i know better than them? i watch tv! of course i know better than them! nancy grace even says he's guilty! what more do we need to know? from now on, they should just fire all the judges and lawyers and let me decide. </sarcasm>  from now on, your future is in my hands! :p there will be no appeals! :p

1	It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?	An example of this would be an airplane for the most part. The laws are strictly enforce although they can still be beaten. However instances of this actually occurring in a way that puts people in danger are few and far between. So yes it can work but it takes incredible measures to make it work.
0	Now, now ZSU, we learned from comrade star gazer that GW created the Continental Army. I am sure these gentlemen have some equally illogical and inaccurate 'facts' to scatter around the barnyard emoticonXHoho	Ah the non human part.
0	And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology.	There doesn't have to be a defined "shot calling" leadership of it any more than there has to be one in Judeo Christianity. The two are actually comparable - Christianity gets its leadership/organization through Biblical reference and church leadership. Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins.
0	No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system.	More concrete than the thought processes which dismiss out of hand the flat statement of the US Secretary of State opining that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, but allow them only to be lawfully held by the state? Sleep well.

1	what did i previously tell you, i.e. well hey, moose, you're in a topic which highly relates to the bible. if you want a secular response there's plenty of those guys around. if you want to chat with me i'll usually be coming from a biblical perspective. but i'll be glad to talk with you on a secular subject if you want. what are you looking for? p.s. please hold your 'honest attempts at discussion' rants, ok? i could easily claim the same with you since you are out of god's wisdom. but i won't. what did you want to know? again, what did you want to know?	you have demonstrated my point. you seem capable of responding to issues in only two ways - either quoting the bible as 'proof' of something, or pasting in some tedious, non-reputable and peripherally related quote. i say your interactions are not honest because you persist in these diversions, instead of directly answering with ideas that came out of your mind. certainly a discussion of religion may involve the bible, but it doesn't always have to. you are incapable of understanding that a bible quote is not proof of anything other proving those words are in the bible. (and even that...) please consider coming to the real world of adult debate where the expectation is that you actually express you own ideas. parroting back some tired platitude is not intellectually honest debate.
1	are you talking about this one??? he was talking about 'god'. he never said your 'god'. and i am both amused and bored by the fact that i just explained to you how evolution and a belief in a creator can co-exist, and you completely ignored it. but you're going to continue to claim that they are mutually exclusive, won't you...	did you not see the post by obvious child that i answered foundit? how can i be changing the subject when i'm responding to a direct statement made by another poster?
1	This is great. You mean none of the Davidic line ever copulated with women to produce their descendents? LOL!	Which of course, , would not have made him the 'seed of david', because the 'seed of david' could only be through the unbroken male line (no women in the mix).
1	B.S. simone. He was the perfect age for Vietnam. Why hasn't he released his draft card? I know, they only sent them to citizens.	It wasn't necessary for President Obama to be in the military when he was coming up but he sure wouldn't have crapped out like George W. Bush and sent someone else to die in his place in Vietnam.
0	And if God was so against killing the unborn, why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn, why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women?I bet you won't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do. See my signature for examples.	He was declaring war on an unclean people whom He commanded the Jews to wipe out in a time of WAR.
0	I got ya, but I still disagree. if free will doesnt exist, then why should I make an effort to do anything? if I am destined to be wealthy, then no matter how lazy I am today, I'll be wealthy sometime down the road. and if Im destined to poor, no amount of hard work and diligence on my part can change that. why wouldnt I just drift along life and allow destiny to take me where I will inevitably end up?	I am sayin that salvation is not a choice. We are pre-destined by God and the Bible clearly states this fact. No free will does not exist. Rom. 8:29  But read 8:26-39 so you can read it in context. Ephesians 1:5  But read 1:1-23 so you can read it in context.
0	He is a hell of a lot wiser than thee.	Let's just point out, as far as the article is concerned, just how many of your fellow Americans you're talking about.And what they must think about someone like you.
1	You do realize you just disproved your own basic points yes?   The pictures you posted are falsified because abortion clinics and small health clinics contract out to places to have their medical waste incinerated.   Good job on failing to realize you just proved Cunx correct.	Can you imagine the cost for every abortion clinic if they owned their own medical waste incinerator? Here's EPA info about the required policies for Medical waste Disposal; http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/129/hmiwi/rihmiwi.html and here's why there are services like this one which take care of that for them. http://www.medicalwastesolutions.com/ Some large hospitals have incinerators due to the large amount of waste they produce, but abortion and small health clinics are way too small to justify the expense.
1	Actually, I read that the god of the bible was really a macaroni monster. He likes cheese, too.	It doesn't really connect to your comment, the whole Paris Hilton theory spawned from eating a whopper and trying to be a nuisance, both of which were highly successful. TROLLS UNITE!
0	john mccain is nothing more than another rino. he is the media's darling from the gop.	even though i am extremely liberal, i kind of liked mccain--until he kissed up to bush after bush and his people crapped all over him in south carolina. the picture of mccain hugging bush! ick! no standards!
1	You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.	You know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non-sentient life forms victims and referring to martin Luther King Jr. to justify their views. It seems today that anyone that shows any decency or slight intelligence or common sense is labeled a radical leftist. Man, the republicans are getting desperate when you see them trying to equate embryos to men using MLK.
0	Any belief system is a religion loosely defined. I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?	I have never heard anyone use the phrase, "I am a human". Rights afforded born people need not descend from religiously inspired "belief systems". Your belief that a fetus deserves the same rights as fully developed people does. In fact all your arguments always flow from this presumption.
0	think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is "wrong" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image	Since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect. To state less would mean that God is not perfect. So if I am the image and likeness of God, then either I am perfect or God is not.
0	"He" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality. For some of us it's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day. But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists, it does nothing to lessen His reality.	No disrespect intended in that I agree with you in that "he" is real to you, just as Santa is to children whose parents told them there is a REAL Santa. Just as you were told when you were very young. Santa also affects the lives of children in a very positive way just like you imaginary god does.
0	No, not really. All that is different is the number of steps.  What is YOUR definition of 'macro-evoution'? Is it speciation? Or is it a brand new genus?  We have observed speciation, where new species happened.	It may be perfectly legitimate to make these inferences, but the point of the statement from wikipedia  was that micro-evolution is directly and (more importantly) currently observable. This seems to be a huge difference between macro and micro evolution,
1	And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?	I'm sure you've been high on marijuana before. And when you're high, you're too ignorant and doped up to know that it's the marijuana that's making you act like a XXXXX.
1	I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?	I will not alter my foundational belief in marriage and family just because some cry for freedom at all costs.
0	Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems.	Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.
0	So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.	It turns out, the Johns Hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life.    "What we now know
0	First of all, it's not a precedent. this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional. Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called "lawlessness". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some "agenda" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us.	This is a push to promote lawlessness. The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example. People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws. This is a devastating precedent for our Nation.
1	That's nice, but have you ever thought of reading your own religion's Holy Book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that Jesus and his disciples said?	I was educated in 12 years of Catholic school plus 2 years at St Josephs univ. in Philly so I know my catechism...That is what is important to me..........
1	As usual, you shoot from the lip. I have no illusion of perfection, However I am convinced that as long as you live I will never be the dumbest man on earth.	I am sorry the only perfect man that ever lived was Jesus Christ and maybe you in your own mind
0	is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers.	no doubt that people who are determined to be anti-bush will always try and find something wrong with it, but i think bush's speech last night was very good. he was confident, poised, the speech had substance and specifics, and he showed once again that he's a better orator than he's given credit for. even a number of democrats complemeted it. only the hardest people would not be touched by the iraqi woman who's husband was killed by saddam's intel, embracing the mother of a fallen soldier. a lot of people got teary at that unstaged moment, including the president himself. kind of put the whole thing in perspective.
1	What prompted this?  I guess I need to check what website I'm in...  Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. But, I've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.  But, carry on, Orion.

Cluck at will... emoticonXChicken emoticonXRolleyes	you'll pardon me, please, if i view your response as that of an idiot or dolt. nothing personal, mind you, just an observation. i'll try, in the future, to custom my responses to you. in any case, fare well. and remember that god loves you, even you.
0	So we should just say "god did it", and give up?	The fact is foundit, that creationists and I-Ders understand that there are so many unanswerable questions, so we know we can't answer them for certain, because Man just doesn't have the knowledge to discern the truth from the minutia.

0	Very true, especially since when someone asks "is there a God" they are most likely really asking "does the God in which I believe exist"	As for the other gods, well since they don't interact with our world they don't really matter at all. they could just as well not be there, and life as we know it would be the same. a question that asks "is there a god?" is answered "it doesn't matter".

0	And if the "natural process of evolution" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked?	Remember that Darwin referred to evolution as the secondary cause by which "the Creator" acted. So, when Miller says "I believe in Darwin's God", he is saying that God sustains the natural process of evolution and an intermediate agent.
1	You mean you don't think you have your own made-up religion?? How interesting! Do you really think you're fooling God? Or us?? Or even yourself??	Yeah, they are lacking. You have your own made-up religion which totally ignores the admonitions against gay sex. Do you really think you're fooling God? Or us? Or even yourself?
1	Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.	Their beliefs are fanciful. We might as well give credence to Murray the mystical Eeel as having created the earth and the universe. It's unparsimonious.You don't need absolute proof for something to be valid. There is no credible proof for creationism, and evolution is the ONLY other viable, parsimonious explanation.

1	I guess the European union is a great failure? Is that why the Euro is trending 1.5 dollars as liberalism creats misery?	Only until the GOP gets its act together or a true Conservative Party can replace it. The idea is that Conservatism works every time it is properly implemented. You have to remember that whenever Liberals have a long term stranglehold (re. New York State), there is no prosperity, only misery and an expansive (and expensive) welfare state.

Australians troops were cannon fodder in WWI for the British Empire, remember Gallipoli?	what? because it's a swear word.  we gave you 'f*ck' too, but do you really think that 'australia: so what the f*cking hell are you waiting for' would be an appropriate ad campaign just because we started the word? emoticonxrolleyes
1	No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is "pro-evolution". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's "faith-based" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach	As for who plays 'word-games', it seems that you missed this... #19 "New peppered moth stuff"He went on for some time trying to undermine my posts based on the use of a word which most people have a problem with.There's also the problem with Darwin claiming a tautology was a better term than "Natural Selection", this was debated for some time, even though I posted the actual words of Darwin.The thread "Unto the Ages of Ages" developed into a debate over whether something could be both ''more accurate' and wrong, thanks Ursus!WJA and SLP argued over the word 'applied', then 'published'; whether Dembski had, and then changed this to 'proved' (see "Looking for intelligence" thread)Lurch/Ungerdunn etc over what is a 'noun'. Multiple personalities aside, this debate over 'nouns' lasted for months. He resorted to no better argument then 'you're wrong'. A great debating style!As for debating styles....Waxy enters a debate on Science/Math says that I've been refuted somewhere else, by someone else, and then leaves; does the same thing on these Creation/Evolution debates... only adds a few insults in the process... not wishing to debate, just to name call.Mach is happy to admit he doesn't read my posts/skims over them but wants to both debate and not debate them - claiming he's got a time problem... and asks me to post stuff he's already replied toWould you count as a word-game the two incidents where you've made a claim about me being insulting, and when I've asked you to point it out, you can't?One time you were so flustered you told me you were going to warn everyone about me. You make allegations then don't back them up.Archilochus makes allegations that I don't understand the word 'chance' but is un-prepared to come up with a definition, just repeats that I don't understand it. He'll go on repeating this, because it is a replacement for debate.All the while you guys are very shy when it comes to debating each other's mistakes; such as Hank describing the world as egg-shaped, etc.In short you make so many 'just-so' statements with little recourse to evidence, in an effort to drown out anyone who differs in opinion from yourself. Hence the total unwillingness to seriously tackle anyone from your own side who is eithera) wrongorb) rudeBut in short, if someone posts here a statement, and they can't even be sure what they mean by it, then it doesn't bode well. That is what has upset a number of people; when this has been pointed out. This is also why many pro-evolutionists are so quick to resort to ad hominem here. That's what this thread of yours is an attempt at - and at best it is something that suggests only other people are guilty of this crime.
1	Hey, someone has to clean our toilets. This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education.	Families that embrace ID/Creationism are increasingly deciding that their children have no place in the "classroom". Something like 58% of homeschoolers are doing it specifically to spare their children science(evolution) education owing to their religious convictions. We're already well behind most other industrialized countries with respect to science and math graduates. This scares me a bit.emoticonXFrazzled
1	are you completely incapable of making sense? penfold used deliberately obtuse language. this language was then explained to you. now you are arguing that 'turn the other cheek' is completely different, and in no way similar, to 'revolve/rotate' the other cheek. if you turn something, you revolve or rotate it. you're so busy being affronted by what people say that you come off as even more simple than they try to make you appear.	when one turns the other cheek in the biblical sense, they neither utilize the inside of their mouth, nor do they revolve or rotate the inside of it. at least not here in the usa. since you're in canada, i can't speak for you. but for anyone to actually argue that penfold used clearly descriptive language in getting his point across, proves that you all are either too ignorant to know any better, or you're just taking this stance in order to stand against me. or both which i suspect it to be, myself. but thanks for chiming in and proving that you are but another lemming in a long line of them here at 4forums.
1	And, let's see, when did the job loss actually start?   Oh yes.. We can trace the troubles starting in 2007, with a big melt down in August/September of 2008. Let's see.. Obama must have been a terrible president to have caused that.. oh WAIT. That wasn't Obama, that was BUSH.. Excuse Me.	No, I don't complain about that, liar. It's the loss of non-government jobs that people don't like. Wake up, yahoo.Now, here's two of your finest cosmopolitan liberals.http://en.ce.cn/Life/trend/200806/30...4798203203.jpgRelatives of yours?
0	So was I. I did say I was playing devil's advocate. As far as I'm concerned, Tiktaalik is a triumph of scientific deduction.	I just was impressed that the fossil was not found by happenstance.
0	I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed. an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human. this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.	my opinion, their banning a gun because of the way it looks they seem to think an ak47 is worse than a regular gun because it looks like a military gun the only true (assault weapon) is fully automatic i have. sereral ak47s but their semi -auto thats not an assault weapon!
1	Did you even read ythe OP? Did you even read the title?   Pointless distinction? Huh.   I understand what you are saying. I also know you are changing your argument. When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it.	You're just not getting it. Either that or you're pretending to not get it. (I suspect it's the latter.) Dude, the point is you're making a pointless distinction. It doesn't say anything that Group A lies about ONE ISSUE while Group B doesn't, when Group B lies about THEIR pet issues just as much. YOU made an issue of them lying about "family values", as if lying about THAT ONE ISSUE sets Republicans apart as being worse that Dems in terms of hypocrisy. It doesn't. Get over it.
1	And you wonder why people call "republicans" racist, women hating bigots. (hint: it's comments like yours)	That spiritually-challenged, deluded, lying slug Obama couldn't carry Rick's jock strap. The only reason Obama is even in office is because blacks are voting for a black man and free stuff, Hispanics want no borders, and most women don't know or don't care how bad the Obama liberals are digging America into the ground financially.
0	That's certainly your right, but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda, not a scientific one. He may want it disguised as a scientific one, but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire.	I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.
0	Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'.	It can certainly be a false theory, however, you can rationally show that it is or is not (to the degree determined by your evidence).
0	it is no "story"........i am debating on the whole evolution thing... look at the facts. so many great ppl, physics people, niels bohr, he was for evoulution, then he found out all of the facts that it is junk, so he became a christian	Is this a debate over the accuracy of the Genesis creation story or just a debate over the general idea that God did in fact create the world and it's inhabitants?
1	Hmm maybe I should take that one to a local patent office...	Glory holes in public conveniences is a gay invention not mine.
1	And, I'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker, right?	I would just want the woman to ask that question before she spreads her legs.Dono
1	So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws).   But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal.	How can you think that a baby that isn't born yet a nonentity?yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what "abortionist's" say is a load of ****!! I feel sorry for you when i get older because im determined with all my heart to stop abortion! I believe God put me on this earth to stop you people from killing his creation! Hear my words i hate liberals and i will never change my mind about abortion. I try to love everyone but it's hard for me to love somebody who kills an innocent child.I am pro life!
1	Is it not extremely cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not suffer from hypothermia due to the extreme cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not fall from the sky and break near all his bones when the wheel well opened for landing after a lengthy flight at 35,000 feet? Do I have to give you the flight number and type of airplane in order to get my stuffed animal circus prize?	Yes... nice guessing. Could you elaborate a bit more, though. For example, when and why did he die of hypothermia?
0	I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are.	They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) ...
0	How do you know carbon dating is so accurate? Would you bet your life on it?	How does it not refute creationism? Creationism states that the world is 7,000 years old. Carbon dating is only accurate up to a point, and that point is WELL beyond creationism's statements.
1	Does this mean that you have finally repented of your multiple divorces??	[B]Let it not be said the grace of God for salvation in Jesus Christ is not freely available.
1	Another red herring gay argument. Ever hear of a medical power of attorney? You don't need marriage to have one, you know. emoticonXRolleyes	It's amazing that someone would list making medical decisions for a loved one who is unable to as a benefit.
1	Ahh, pointy tailed devils with pitchforks, more of your menagerie of divvels, demons, saints, angels, demigods, ghosts and other varied superstitious nonsense. Which of your gods created them, Snerdley?	That serpent, the devil, has been having his way with you for some time now. You might want to go get some Tucks pads.
1	Come on down to skid row with the rest of us 'lower class' I'll even buy a bottle of MD 20/20 on me.	Alas, I can no longer drink any sort of alcoholic beverage, although I used to love to drink the excellent foreign beers, high grade gin, scotch, brandy etc., in other words, sipping whiskey as opposed to the cheap raw stuff that the lower classes guzzle up.
1	oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.	I was and am fine actually. Don't know about anyone else, but I don't think you have that much impact on our lives SS Who's more arrogant? The person searching for truth or the person who claims to know everything?
0	I know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but I think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has, what post number this is, how many are left, any comments concerning going outside the rules, etc.	I do not see any problem with the Jehova's or any other's idea of a scriptural account. Once the debate has begun, I will not make another post until the end.One week sounds reasonable - you might want to post within a shorter gap later on, but that will be up to the person posting. You should both be able to post in your own time. A week is sufficient, I should think.I recommend that no limit be placed on posts, but that it is recommended that posts stay generally smaller. It's far more challenging to be succint than to write gallons. One more tip: it's a good idea to, in your first posts, include definition so that terms might be clarified, and it avoids later, unecessary hassle. If we just wait for Hank's clarification on those few points, then we can then begin!
0	What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking.	That's my claim
0	What possible concern is any of that to you?    Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon.	Do you believe that you will hear an understanding of God that you've not heard before, or are you of the belief you are open-minded on the subject, and might well have an epiphany?
1	Simone, read the sentence again please. It was "Saving lives is "not just" a Republican goal." It concerns the subject of abortion.   The only way it relates to the politics of Iraq, is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to "volunteer" their services for Iraq.   I can't let one statement you made go though. Terrorist continue to terrorize us? Where have they attacked in the U.S. since 9-11? Consider continuing this in an appropriate thread.	Saving lives is a Republican goal?Then, why have the Republicans condemned us to this ugly, nonproductive war in Iraq?The terrorists continue to terrorize us because we have deterred our efforts against them to Iraq, (and Bush intends to widen this nonproductive war into Iran and Syria) where nearly 700,000 Iraqis have been needlessly slaughtered, where more than 3,000 of our young have been sacrified in vain, and you have the audacity to say that "saving lives is a Republican goal."Meanwhile we burn Saudi Arabian oil and by so doing, fuel the funding of countless schools of hate against the United States throughout the world.Osama bin Laden, the prime terrorist in the world, issued out of Saudi Arabia. He was funded by Saudi Arabia. Most of the terrorists on those planes that attacked my nation on September 11, 2001, were from Saudi Arabia.Iraq had nothing to do with that attack. Iran had nothing to do with that attack. Syria had nothing to do with that attack.Ever had an attack of reality, Gman?
1	your "minds"? How many do you have? Oh, and "I wanted to see what inferior it was"? Nice example of your supposed superiority.	I changed My minds and decided to read your link. Not because it could effect what was said (it was pointless to your position) but because I wanted to see what inferior it was. I found this :
1	'slaves, tortures, drones, dictators' hmm, what does that sound like? oh yeah, the history of most european countries, including germany.	america invaded more countries, today has less freedoms (patriot act and so on), of all countries in the world germany is the only one, that hasn't a 'shady' history, cause everything has been come to light and regretted. the us still thinks ( your post as an example) it was/ is a force of good. no 'wiedergutmachung' of american history ( slaves,tortures, drones, dictators)
1	Yet another of your posts that wouldn't pass the Turing Test...	This was talking about the Turing guy who slept with men. I am sure glad he did!! If he had not, we would still be living in the stone ages. emoticonXConfused
