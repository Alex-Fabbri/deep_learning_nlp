0	well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.	How in any sense is creationism the alternative?
1	yeah, ez is what will come back to haunt you. hay ez you know why i can say anything i want about jesus with out consequence? it's because jesus never existed. sleazy, when are you going to grow up?	- revelation 6:8 beware of what you say about jesus because i guarantee you it will come back to haunt you.
1	Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?	So the debate is just whittled down to two factions; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs.
0	That sounds like an honest answer. How did you feel about it at the time? How do you feel about it now? Just trying to educate myself more.   Huck	another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on (acording to the doctors i spoke with) - i would be unable to work - that's four months, and while right now i am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that, back then i was just starting out, and would be unable to do so.
1	Why would I want lies , deceptions and superstition? I mean, if believing in Jesus makes people act like you, NO THANKS	Then read John 3:36 because it applies to people like you who deny Christ.
1	Looks like my first response to this was deleted? I'll risk it again since this post was not deleted.  Anyhoo,  This post just wreaks of the emotional and psychological development, maturity, morality, character, and integrity of SOME Republicans/Conservatives. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy	well, when the civil war begins, i have no doubts we will win..afterall, we would be facing wimps, sissies and snivelling little brats
1	Care to post some proof or should everyone just believe it because you say it?..	Hitler was definitely gay.He couldnt have proper sex with a woman.He surrounded himself with big beefy males .He liked to walk around in leather shorts.Have you seen his speeches..they are as camp as you can getHe loved to watch musicals.he had an enormous chip on his shoulder and an inferiority complexHe was gay alright.As for Goering.....
0	It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!	Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?
0	you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are. any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what "morals" should be drawn out of the biomorphs.	So, this magical program that is supposed to represent life actually can also produce aeroplanes!
1	loll i love how you completely ignore the link i posted ehh?? and then you downvoted me and tried to sound smart afterwards, but actually made yourself look like twice a fool. :d. you better upvote me again. smh. hah.	if it is bs as you say, then you should be able to easily provide rebuttals to each and every acronym, no?
0	Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.	The fossil record does not support this.
0	Almost? Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.	The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population.
1	So, am I looking for attention or am I mentally ill?	Once some of that turns up, I will start to keep an open mind to your side of the story.
1	much more is happening in the world today than your little gay crusade matthew. but keep your single issue, and totally limited perspective in life, that's what you're good at. could you post where i said that revelation speaks to the rcc vs the protestant reformation ms ? as christ was a jew trebor, his followers wont ever cease to exist, just as god has preserved the jew according to his promises. i'm surprised you can't appreciate that my friend.	actually, it will continue till christianity is a dead religion, cause 'jesus' is not returning..
0	Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By "true human" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent. I have got to go to school, continue this later.	It begins to look, then, that this is a piece of crude propaganda (see note below), deliberately manipulated to give the false impression that the fact of evolution is seriously under scientific question, and that the fanciful notions of creation `scientists' are contributing to that debate.
0	No. I never mentioned grades. You brought that one up. I'm saying that having guns on school campus isn't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area.	So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?
1	"while at home" huh. When did your right to self-defense end at your property line?That is quite a stretch from an old bubble gum chewer even like yourself sliiiick.Thank G-d I live in Texas!!! Those facists states are already failed states so it is semantics anyway when the slaves get restless. criminals are a tyrants wanna be best friend.Everyone should know by now that the cops have no duty to defend anyone no matter the excuses...you are on your own. Everyday I read about the predator leos preying on the electorate so which is worse?	I don't believe Mr. Hamm was refering to the issue of CCW at all, just the right to defend oneself while at home.
0	You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples.	This entire issue was dealt with on this threat here, starting at post250.
1	are you kidding? uh, i hate wasting my 1000th post on you, but here goes. i don't believe that the pm was vile and profane, because jitobear doesn't do that unless you get her really ###### off. second, you're not the most credible person on this forum. and no one has lost it. maybe in your mind, but not in reality. is this how you react when you're cornered, when your bible rhetoric fails? because its kind of pathetic.	but there's still hope for you all if you'll turn from your anti-biblical folly and quit with your failed moral relativism.
0	Well that is good that you recognize our society eats too much meat and too much protein. Now will you agree with me that you can get all the protein you need from whole wheat bread, oatmeal, beans, corn, peas, mushrooms, and broccoli? Now granted some vegetarians eat alot of junk food, and in that case they are NOT getting the right amount of protein. But many vegans like myself dont eat ANY junk food and follow the recommended food pyramid for vegans. I follow it very strictly and I know beyond any doubt that I am more healthy than the vast majority of Americans out there.	It is only because we eat too much meat and I had said that before.
0	I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.   Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.   You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth.	however, most religions that i consider 'christian' are really not the same as 'catholic.'
0	The anti-abortionists claim a load of **** on many issues. I don't listen to them. To put the "life" of an unfertilized egg above that of a person is grotesquely sick IMO. I support any such stem cell research wholeheartedly.	The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.

0	So God gets to do these terrible things, but He gets a free pass because He's God?Kinda funny what happens when you show Archie that the Bible doesn't even support his beliefs, isn't it guys?I still like the fact that the Bible says not to count children under one month of age as persons, yet here Archie expects us to count a zygote as "a human life."	If your knowledge of the bible, and your understanding of Gods holy nature is so limited as to not know the answer to these questions Matthew, then me answering them isn't going to change your mind about anything you currently believe.

1	Other than the Soldini firearms were purchased legally there is no proof that he had a concealed carry permit. If he had the AP and the rest of the left-tard media (redundancy alert) would still be shouting it from the roof tops. Just because the Brady bunch-VPC says so doesn't make it true. Then what else can we expect from a self confessed torturer of helpless small animals and arsonist?	Six people out of, at the very least one million, at the very most five million.Are you really gonna prosecute one million plus people based on the actions of six individuals?
1	Ah yes, the 'Let's pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult, therefore god exist' routine. That arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique, or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to Christianity. It does drive them away, so please, be my guest and keep on trying to use it. I figure the ratio of people you drove away from Christianity to those people who were converted to Christianity from you must be way lop sided.	And I say you're both spiritually-challenged and don't know what you're talking about.Jesus is Lord and all who deny him are antichrists (1 John 2:22).And anybody who's a Trebor-trekkie can't be all there anyway.

0	Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.	It seems to me the corollary of the phrase "abortion is murder" is "miscarriage is manslaughter", and that any consistent pro-life advocate must urge any mother who accidentally loses her child due to actions she undertook, be charged with manslaughter.I wonder, is this actually the case?

0	State courts can rule based on state and/or federal law. In this case, the answer was found in the state constitution, so the judge did not need to pursue the issue further.Also, a state constitution can offer more protection that the federal one, as long as, in so doing, it does not contradict the federal constitution.	The California judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the Federal Constitution; it would have to be taken to the Federal Courts for that.

0	Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them.

They will not necessarily get paid less, there will just be fewer of them.

The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.	What if the answer to that was 0?

0	No Peeling, it would be, "We proved it was possible to evolve as humans have, so why can only we do it?" Why hasn't one other creature on Earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution? If evo is real, then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that weren't forced into extinction, but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years.Unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever. And that is my claim and belief.	I can't recall the name of this particular fallacy, but if I were to name it it would be the "If it were possible, someone would have done it already" fallacy, the consistent application of which leads one to believe it is impossible for anything to happen for the first time.

0	I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.	Because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist, "ToE", that is, that such novel trait changes/'expressions' originate from-- "Random Genetic Mutation", coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that "Natural Selection" does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring.

First thing I want to say is that I dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option.

0	you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there.	as i said previously, 'tookie's' defenders seem to be overzealous in their defense of the man (i can only take your word for it since i really haven't been paying much attention), but i do not see how their accusations have anything to do with hate crimes, and your perceptions of how they're enforced.

0	addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails	If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created.
1	as i observed earlier, you seem intent on attacking islam. why else would you devote so much energy to a thread entitled 'muhammed's child bride'? you've said it yourself, as in... and... howard suggested to you that you might learn something about islam by reading rumi. you asked me to quote to you from rumi? very well... spring is christ, raising martyred plants from their shrouds. their mouths open in gratitude, wanting to be kissed. the glow of the rose and the tulip means a lamp is inside. the wind is the holy spirit. the trees are mary. the scent of joseph's shirt comes to jacob. a red carnelian of yemeni laughter is heard by muhammad in mecca. and... moses, the inner light of revelation, lit up the top of sinai, but the mountain could not hold that light.	though i realise this in itself is predisposing me slightly (maybe significantly) to one side, i think it is important to be able to argue your point from the opponents side if you really want to convince or convert someone.
0	so you get to whine and moan and complain (lie) that i didn't address your points, then when i challenge you to support your points against my counterarguments, you say that you don't need to. you're a hypocrite, archie.  ignore it? bhbcu64 made a valid point and made significant elaborations. the only responses we've seen are 'you're wrong' with no explanation, and two 'why does this follow?'s, apparently due to ignorance of that pesky little thing called law.	in fact, you know that even they got it when they ignore it.

If Christianity included gays you would still be one JJ.You think Jesus hates you so youre getting your own backemoticonXRolleyes
0	You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.	You just wish to ignore them as you do everything that contridicts your belief.
1	* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)	true

0	And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world.	I hope you dont believe everything that is written in a textbook that has been changed over and over.

1	You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men.	My question is thus, should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child's unruleiness?
0	AGREED!!!!That has to be BY FAR the best series I've ever read!Also, Asimov's Foundation triligoy is good.

I think Orson Scot Card who wrote:Enders Game,Speaker For The Dead,Children Of The Mind,Xinocide,Enders Shadow,Shadow Of The Hegemon and,Shadow Pupetsis by far the best author that ever lived or ever will live!!!

1	that's me, and proud of it. but i guess you get your jollies when pagan religious symbols or a pagan religious event can be displayed / practiced, but to heck with anything that might resemble christianity? real nice and equitable there, moose.  it got me a lot of 'excellent!' and 'way to go!' remarks from a number of co-workers.  bull. i've seen it, though it's been many decades now. get real. halloween itself is a pagan religious event, if you will do some research for a change. once again, pagan-related religious themes are fine, but screw the christians.  aren't you one of the libs who tries to sell their 'tolerance' (except for anything christian)? reckon so.	did that move get you voted employee of the month from your co-workers?
0	Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist.	I don't have the right  to make accusations about logical fallacies and how do you know I don't know what they mean.
0	I responded to your posts on the thread of "Lets discuss the actual..." I suggest we continue that discussion there.	You made a 'just-so' statement about what is scientific method, and your own talkorigins site suggested this was one of several philosophies.Further you said definitions don't need to be justified/proven, and again I cited talkorigins that shows this isn't the case.

0	Well, their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig. No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all. Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it's money and political and emotional capital. Stick a fork in them Lucy, they are done emoticonXHoho	So according to the Anti-gun side, we should see a humongous progression of citizen killings of innocent citizens, or in other words, criminals, as the number of Concealed Carry states pass their laws and allow permit holders carry concealed handguns.
0	No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.	Evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change
0	This is a push to promote lawlessness. The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example. People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws. This is a devastating precedent for our Nation.

1	Oh, I get it. So you believe, but you don't exactly "believe".	i am agnostic not atheist, but its close enough for close minded people to understand
1	What's sick is your theological comprehension.  God took Ananias and Sapphira (Acts chapter 5) off the earth just for lying. And you want to give JFK, the serial adulterer, a pass? That's how lame your theological thinking is.	have you never sought counseling for your malady?
1	Sigma, I was only joking. It hit me this morning though that if I'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God, I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up "women's rights". ;-)	Not all who are "left" hate God.
1	Speaking from ignorance once again, eh SP? Did you, by chance, ever read the 2000 Census form? Did you happen to see the category "unmarried partner"? I didn't think so. Now, go eat some crow. emoticonXHoho   http://www.census.gov/population/www...0/samesex.html	Yes, JP is using his usual tactic of bait and switch, starting out with a claim, and then replacing it with something that he thinks we won't notice is different.As foundit also pointed out, his statistics show "same-sex" households, which can mean roommates, etc.
1	So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others, should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not?	The figures for the number of gun related deaths in the US should be evidence enough that 'the people' cannot be trusted with guns.
1	Hmm.. does that include the Muslim Communities you were associated with too?.. We know as rational people that Denial is the Christians best weapon. You should seriously consider increasing your medications..	Especially since I, a born again believer is here adamantly denying that I or every christian community I have ever been associated with would ever support or endorse a christian oligarchy in the USA.

0	Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.	ANY aspect of science that can be discredited helps strengthen the creationist stance.
1	I dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  Once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  We are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but I am sure the preacher would condemn that too  If you read the link you would know.  If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  You really should try to use your little head more.  'Lets stay on topic' who made you a mod?emoticonXChicken	and for someone who doesn't tolerate government intrusion, you sure seem to like government intrusion when it comes to interfering with marriage.
0	Use some basic comprehension indeed. How do you think Dohzhansky 'produced' assortative mating? It was by letting the laboratory population go on interbreeding for enough generations - exactly as happens when assortative mating occurs within or between natural populations. What, did you imagine he operated on them, or something? Geeeeez..	How do you ignore that?
1	Yeah, and we all know what happened when they did that with Galileo. emoticonXRolleyes	Because the RCC has held for centuries that their version of "THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH" trumps scientific fact.
0	Because, when each is in its natural habitat, they are reproductively isolated.	so why do they call polar bears and brown bears different "species" when they can breed and produce fertile offspring together?
1	Strange, I thought it was supposed to be a global flood that wiped out all of man except the chosen few. That would be 'involving Australia' one assumes.	It's more probable that the other culture(s) stole it from the descendants of Noah in the first place.As for Xcaliber's Tourette Syndrome rant about having to go to Australia to pick up Koala bears, God doesn't need to do that.
1	i think you underestimate the intelligence of a 6 year old and what they can comprehend............... and that 6 year old is not only the people but the future which makes it even more imperative that he or she know the sacrafices others have made to make this country the great country it is........ i am not surprised you call it brainwashing though....... emoticonxrolleyes	and i think you have it a little mixed up, this country is the people.

1	But you sure don't hesitate to portray them that way when you use one to bolster the other! Or when you fail to actually (GASP) qualify the matter by noting the differences as well as the similarities. Hey, it's just accuracy, so why get in a fuss over it, huh? emoticonXRolleyes Why not go ahead and invoke the Jewish genocide while you're at it, or call anyone who has a different opinion "Hitler?" I mean it's the same sort of generalization.	In the name of all that is evil and unholy ...Jyoshu - I have never said that the civil rights movement of blacks and gays are identical!Not once!
0	But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority.	The problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people.
0	So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?	I don't believe in any gods, but thankyou for assuming anyone who disagrees with your ridiculous assertions about proving gods non-existance must be a theist.Just like creationists assume anyone who disagrees with creationism must be an atheist.You're just as bad as them, and your arguments, if you could call them that, just as short on substance.
1	like in afghanistan? hopefully it will go a little better with this puppet, his own bodyguard was the latest in a slew of assasination attempts.	no one likes war but you got to do what you got to do.

0	So producing a child is the defining characteristic of a marriage? What about love, trust, respect, companionship? My wife and I may decide to not have a child, does that mean our marriage should be made illegal? Again, you keep posting nambla this and nambla that. Nambla is a group of deviant pedophiles, homosexuals despise this behavior too. GROW UP DHARD...I mean DMG2FUN. ;)	When two gay men get together and have sex that produces a kid is the day I will defend gay marriages.Plus if this is ok then why do gays need organizations like nambla to recruit children into the gay life style.
0	Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?	Not in matters of science.
0	No more so than the Scalia/Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case.	And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.
0	And as their populations grew over thousands of years, civilizations seperate out and independent nations form, laws are set up, and some prosper while others wallow in poverty, how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets? Nice dream, but real life does not work like that.	As much as I'd love pacifism and peace and tolerance and all that wonderful stuff, and I do believe, as my signature says, that violence is the last refuge of the incompetent, it can't be helped so long as we live in a world where people think they need violence.
0	take a look at your post no. 80 time-stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said ...in response to my post #79 wherein i said: does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say? back in post #77, i requested that you quote and debunk the links. you merely scoffed at them (as i expected). prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument, please explain the above. i'll be back next week.	not once did i change the meaning of anything you said, so unless you'd like to quote where i did that, all you have is baseless assertions and a cool method of squirming out of statements you cant support

0	so what about jesus' life is credible if the source is unreliable? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead? what did the authors get right? i mean, i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace. but you dont. so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did?it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true, otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have.	Some may believe that it's the unadulterated word of God, but looking at the above passage it's also easy to believe that it's also the work of common people.The rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line, and I believe I've shown that a reasonable person might not, so I'm going to skip to your next paragraph.
0	The majority of criminals don't want to deal with trouble. Most aren't looking for a shootout where there's a risk of them getting shot at and most don't even want to shoot period. Most are just looking for the free stuff they can get or in cases of rape they're definately not looking to fight an armed victim. It has been shown that criminals are less likely to break into a house whose owner has a gun.	More likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance.There is no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand-gun
1	I think that might mean that you should shut your trap about other people and not pass judgement on them (i.e. Carl Sagan right here in this topic, etc.). What do you think?	Romans 2:11You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
1	If by "We the People" you mean a handful of self appointed persons with strong financial intrest in the running of the country...   The document is largely a copy of the theories of Montesqieu and John Locke.	At the risk of becoming embroiled in a seemingly heated exchange, I think I might interject with a little history....To answer Smiley's question: “who wrote the constitution?” I would say the answer is found in the preamble to the document: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” (bold emphasis added)
0	I don't that it's selfish so much as self-interested. There is a difference. Most people want to live a long life. Is this selfish? The idea of an after life is merely an extension of this same idea.Why do you think belief in an afterlife leads to contempt for society?	I am inclined to believe that the desperation of one to "exist forever" is a very selfish conceit and leads to contempt for the rest of society.
0	The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong?

1	Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.	so if that satisfies everyone's dues then this is done with.
0	maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points.	Again show me something other than an opinion.
1	That is a completely subjective assessment. Thelmoose and Unkerpaulie were already quick to dissociate themselves from any smugness or self righteousness on this very thread.   It's a schism!

0	I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures, such as the literal reading of Genesis (which was never meant to be literal to begin with, but that is a different matter).It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people.However, when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe, science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being.	1) Science has disproven the young-earth Creationists' God.
0	really? wow! my parents did the same thing! we had a water-cooler bottle that my dad put change into for years, and when we were little kids we went to cash it in, all of us helping to roll the hundreds of pounds of coins, and it ended up being worth over $900! ever since then, i've been a coin fanatic. people are so quick to throw away change. my friends know that i'll always take a nickel or a few pennies if they don't want to carry them around.	anyway, my sister and i took them in... about $1000 but now we don't have any coins.
1	It's only obvious to the delusional ones, as I did not lift it from anyone. Just stating the truth. If it hurts, tough.	(And by the way, don't think it's not all-too-obvious that you lifted the "credibility" line from Thelmoose's comments to Jim.)
1	are you clear as to what you are questioning here? or just kicking up dust? sounds like a are you still beating your live in lover type of question from the gunners seat.	would a prosecution for shooting an intruder in the states demonstrate the illegality of using a gun for self-defense in america?

"OK, just for you, one more time, now concentrate like a laser beam...."Irrelevant to the issue of same sex marriage.
0	So have you found figures pertaining to the rate of mountain growth? It is not enough to see with the naked eye the way erosion is. This explanation would also cause some mountains to fall as tectonic plates move away from eachother. Again after billions of years all rivers in existence would be deeper than those in the grand canyon without the material coming down from mountains.	This is know and quantifiable given that all branches of sciences and all current forms of dating back it up.

0	Now you are confusing me. In a previous post, you wrote this: "A gay couple has no more right to marry then two brothers"But now you say that you never said there "is no right to same sex marriage." So are you arguing that two brothers do have the right to marry? I am reading your posts, but you seem to make contradictory arguments. That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway. It sounded like a nuanced argument to me. But apparently that is not what you were saying? Can you clarify this?Thanks.	I did not say there is no right to same sex marriage and I did not say that same sex marriages should be illegal...I thought that you read my posts..you obviously do not......

If you or the others are bothered by his ignorant banter please let me know, and I will stop forcing him to give answers on subjects that he so obviously has no clue.	Just trying to read through a page of this, it seems disjointed at best.
1	oh hun i am sorry, i'll get right on that :) but yes i retouched her scars, she's a cutter for sure...	for work of course, not for my birthday present.
1	We are figments of our own imaginations, sent here by Satan to annoy the faithful! emoticonXAngel	I guess people who think homosexuality is "just a behavior" must think celibate homosexuals don't exist.
1	Er . . . how do you know that god hasn't told anyone to kill enmasse (in the last 2000 years)? Does he run all his orders by you?	I am humble enough and introspective enough to look at my own past, recognize my own human frailties, nature and shortcoming and humble myself before His perfect wisdom and knowledge to see clearly that which isn't clear to me at the time.Also, just to clarify, God hasn't told me or anyone else to kill anyone enmasse in 2000 years since the advent of the Age of Grace which Jesus, our Messiah ushered in.
0	Just like the Brady Campaign. Often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals, most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with, or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens-rea and weren't crimes to begin with.	Those given to emotional rhetoric don't mind one bit if it suits their agenda.
0	Among other things, generally adaptions to a colder environment.    As for your theory as a whole, doesn't the whole 15, 000 year gap between the extinction of the Neanderthalls and the development of farming (particularly the grains youre talking about).	There are quite a lot of other differences between modern human and neaderthals other than just 'brain size'.Well, right... neanderthals were short and stocky and big-boned...
1	are you retarded or just ignorant? either way, get your facts right. limbaugh and savage do not have tv shows so if they want to listen to beck they still can on the radio. second, you imply fox fired beck...umm, no. third, the glenn beck program was the third most watched cable news program between two other fox news programs.  i'm not a fan of the glenn beck tv program but at least i'm not going around making stuff up.	his listeners will have to go to limbaugh, savage or some other purveyors of tea party issues.
1	the ones that make you stupid. you are so passionate about this thing that your judgment is impaired. i am kind surprised that you let your emotions influence your quest for truth. atlas shrugged is as dangerous as the bible and people like you are as bad as religious fundamentalists.	i am there... sorta, but i want to debate not talk about how much i agree with someone :p you know... it was exactly the kind of situation someone like you belongs in.
1	Yes, it doesn't agree with your agenda so it must be trolling.	This post is IMO borderline trolling...
1	Of course you don't. It's the natural humanistic way of thinking.	that's right, i don't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.
1	Wow, that must be some good stuff he was drinking to keep him 'under the influence' for THAT long!! :p	Whether or not this affected his thinking is a question which should to be considered when asking questions about mormon theology.
0	if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?	people have been warning for the last 30 years that deindustrialisation is a really bad idea, and that loading up massive amounts of personal and public debt is an even worse idea.
1	Society highly values the creation of future taxpayers, especially under deficit-spending socialist presidents. :p	Cause frankly I fail to see the benefit of your marriage to me or anyone else outside of your family at all.
1	Yes, mulitculturalism is wonderful. You know what else is wonderful? Fact checking:Archie swallows own foot againIt was the second link when I googled his name. At least try to not look like a jackass every time you post.	Many said that Alghabra’s key supporter, councilor and Liberal party member Khalid Usman who came from Markham, took the podium with Alghabra, announcing, "We have the East, we have the West, and now we have Mississauga!"
0	is this what jpsartre meant? at any rate, to say that there were large numbers of gay men, being infected in the u.s., is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself. there is a connection when there is active sexuality, gay or straight, and aids is a sexually transmitted disease. we actually don't know who patient zero was. what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men, and fewer heterosexuals, to the best of our available knowledge? this is a disease, and unknowingly spreading it, no matter who you are, is not murder. the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group, who had sex among that group, before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it; that would also not be murder.	becuase the thread is primarily focused on the initial outbreak and spread of aids in the us, and to say there is no connection between that outbreak and spread and sexuality either demonstrated that you are either completely and totally ignorant of the facts, or you have utterly blinded yourself in the name of political correctness.
0	But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.	...if we see relatively few creationists on these boards, all that means is, theres relatively few creationists on these boards.
1	I think pedophilia is a disorder as opposed to an illness but I'd have to look back at some psychology books. How do I define illness? Well, I have a few contexts for this. The flu...obvious illness. Christians feel that sin is an "illness", so in that sense we are all rather ill :). As for wrong...same deal.	Well, I define illness based upon the way medical professionals define illness, in which case, homosexuality is NOT an illness, and pedophilia is.Upon what criteria do you define illness?Upon what criteria do you judge them as wrong?
1	why? that doesn't make alot of sense. we say gas go over $2 during a period of relatively low demand. why would gas stabalize that a price that is lower then what it was during a period of low demand when high demand is projected with increases consumption in china the us and the industralized world as a whole? oh yes, i'm asking the person who thinks that cds are good investments during periods of low inflation. emoticonxrolleyes	this is grat news..............so much for the gloom and doomers........i think you will continue to see prices fall and the price of gasoline will stabalize at about $1.85 a gallon.................. the reason why gasoline is so expensive in other countries,especially in europe is because they have huge taxes built into the price..........
0	Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles.	If the intent behind the Chicago handgun ban is truly racist then why allow blacks to own rifles?
1	Then what's Mississippi's problem? They must be run by a-holes because they are being forgotten.	Perhaps his problem was not being able to deal with LA a-holes?
1	Well that lets out most of the supreme court when RvW comes up! And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote. Perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea!	I see that many of you are busily discussing angels on the head of a pin questions.My view is that no man ought to have any opinion whatsoever on a woman's decision of whether or not to terminate a pregnancy unless and until she asks him.
0	that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?	that is something i'd rather not do and i am forced to.
0	Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood. And it goes way the heck beyond speculation. Check out how homeobox genes work and how regulation by master switches is understood as just two examples.	On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as “temperature and embryonic diet” might cause proteins to fold differently and thus “whip up” complex systems such as “eyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shells”
1	Yeah, lets tax those rich greedy jerks!!! I mean really, why be equal when you want something for free right??? SCREW FREEDOM I WANT MY HEALTHCARE!!!	You get what you pay for in this regard.
0	based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not.	see... http://www.catholic.net/rcc/loveboth/chapter27.html http://www.factcheck.org/article336.html the number of illegal abortions is also overstated...some estimate it is only around 100,000...considering 1973 only had around 800,000 abortions it doen't seem likely that a year before 1million were done illegally.
1	And so goes the fact you're more than willing to let rapists and murderers go free.	There you go again, conflating questioning with disobeying.Da*n right you should question the cop who pulls you over.
1	But AA's not responsible for that, because he is an A-rab.	He also forgets that an estimated 20 million native americans were killed by smalpox introduced by europeans, or "Joe Christian" as JP puts it
0	Form 4473, question 11a reads as follows:11.a. Are you the actual buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.	Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.
1	And you can be described as a "pre-dead corpse" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???	Baby can be used to describe a human fetus.
1	Your signal to noise ratio was too low for my tastes: too much "wackiness" (I assume "wackiness" was what you were trying for) and irrelevant side discussions.	This is a PIE adapter that goes into the factory AUX/CD changer controls....Listen to one and you will hate the cassette thingy,,,,
1	pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ?   your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.  My advice to you ?  keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.	my age is irrelevant to the fact that i simply know more than you can comprehend.
1	Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.	So we advise against relying on any ‘evidence' he provides, unless supported by creationist organisations with reputations for Biblical and scientific rigour.
1	I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?	You'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent, before I'd agree that they are as bad as you imply, but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes.
1	and yet you ignored the specific link mentioning the current regs while asking for it at the same time.  no, i dislike your techniches because they are unethical, hold double standards, and aren't based on facts.  oh yes, who was the one who asked for the reg link while ignoring it at the same time?  the fact that you quote newsmax says much about how much credence anyone here gives you.	you come up with more unrelated **** than anyone else on this board.
1	So, I guess in your view, educating people against prejudice and intolerance is a bad thing.	I'm sure you're right, but then again, they are also disageeing with countless other people on that point as well.
1	jos 24:15? what book of the bible is that? i thought i knew the names of all the books of the bible used by protestants but i don't recognize jos.	jos 24:15 'if it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the lord, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the river, or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the lord.'
0	could you see language evolving in non social animals? it wouldnt have a reason to.	why would intelligence not evolve in animals that do not have complex social behavior patterns?
1	I guess we all missed your point Justine, whatever it might have been. emoticonXConfused Better luck next time. emoticonXGood	Obviously you missed the point.
0	Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age. What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is? What is the importance of knowing if somebody's white, black or mexican when they're buying a gun?	A more logical explanation is that there may have been racist gun laws during a certain time period but gun control isn't inherently racist.
0	End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.	and you consider it drivel because?the amendement reads:A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
1	Senior citizen yachties stand little chance of defending themselves against pirates.   Piracy needs to be dealt with using military might.	So why should merchant ships be required to go unarmed and defenseless in dangerous areas?
0	If Congress decides to remove the law, what can the military do?Nothing.Logically, they're not a barrier...	...and how military personnel are no barrier to repealing gay exclusion rules, its good for a laugh.
1	** This is the best response you've got!?! What a loser!!	What couints is the functioning of the system as a whole.
0	This is a separate issue, Voice of Reason. Some didn't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally wouldn't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other's right to do it, and that's what I was answering.	The fact you always ignore is your not just doing it to your body.....
1	He didn't pursue the "master race of white Protestant." He was a pure Aryanist, genius one. The very least you could do is get your facts straight, but you probably like spreading this bullcrap on purpose. (Seeing as how you're an atheist.)	why did hitler pursue the master race of white protestant...
1	I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.	the formation or expression of an opinion or theory without sufficient evidence for proof.
0	Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child? Not likely. I think she will still suffer through those thoughts. Killing the baby complicates this. What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion?	The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis....
0	why didn't you think of it? it took me no time at all to find the actual article, who authored it, and how to contact them. from what i have seen of your post, you rarely think at all.	when he responds i may email him myself :)
0	i love how every line, except number 3, has a winking emoticon at the end. haha	oh well, at least i met my 50 character limit.
1	Yeah, there are quite a number of dumb Republican bureacrats running Califorhia.	Correct but its California where common sense is dead and bureaucrats rule supreme.
0	But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government.	Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me.
1	It's also a noun. But since you're unable but to repeat your self, maybe a few more times will make it 'true'	If you take a fish from the arctic seas, and put it in some chilled water (say, 5 degrees celcius) then that fish is going to think it is very hot, despite the fact we would call the water cold.
0	i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a "possibility of existence". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: "greatest possible being". the "greatest possible being", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole "proof" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as "the greatest being possible". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled	Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.
1	As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.	As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off.
1	Damn, takes some real gonads (wait, you're a Lib, so scratch THAT one) to claim the power to get inside the minds and hearts of the masses...a protest by Conservatives MUST be racist, but a protest by Libs is pure and righteous, correct?	Even Fox News puts the attendance in five digits, yet FW tries to pretend they are much larger.2) Pretend a uniformity of presence behind a rational banner, when the truth is that a LARGE segment of attendance sits behind a looney banner (like calling the president racist or Kenyan or secret Muslim or fascist / socialist / communist / nazi).THAT is my point.Or an even more popular one?The strawman argument!
1	What is it that you disagree with? My statement of fact? Or the fact that I made a politically incorrect assertion? emoticonXConfused	Jake, while I don't agree with JP that this should be an issue of blame, with all due respect, your point here is a bit disingenuous--smallpox isn't easily spread by engaging in a given behavior as HIV is--HIV is a sexually transmitted disease.
1	First off, your sick. To actually want to see more death and destruction.  Are Americans somehow less intelligent? Your notions are racist for lack of a better term. What to meet stupid? Walk out your front door and sample the people on the side walk. You'll find the same stupid around the world.	i hope they do bomb the us, but actually get the pentagon this time.
1	Funny. Foreigners are always cited when liberals talk about how great gun control is and how much good can come from it.	You're not even in the same hemisphere.
1	Apparently in Marc9000's small, small, small world, if you're not a Christian, you're a atheist.   Thus over 4 billion people are atheists. emoticonXAgree	It pretty much puts an end to the argument if you're an atheist.
0	Very sad news. I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery.	His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up.
1	That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.	OH, OH, OH.., How much you'd like to relegate your immorality to the devil.
1	So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?	Therefore, we can conclude that teaching evolution is not teaching knowledge nor science, and as such, is teaching ignorance (defined as lack of knowledge).
1	I won't hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you've composed. Guess we'll chalk it up to puffery.	What he doesn't want you to know is the depth of lawlesness and infringement is already in effect and is only working to punish innocent people and has nothing to do with crime control...it is all about ultimate disarmament and loss of Second Amendment rights.
1	And the Brady background check has not been repealed either so by your "logic" it must be effective.	There's been no mass adoption of these laws by various states across the country, and there's even been cases of them being repealed due to ineffectiveness.If gun control laws worked at controlling crime, and the presence of firearms actually had the potential to increase crime rates, these facts would be reversed.
1	so, global warming no, but weather control devices, yes? perhaps too many people are playing red alert these days...	as long as catagory 5 hurricans have been happening, it doesn't make sence that catagory 5s are created by a cold war device.
0	were they assigned the ultimate task of interpreting the constitution and determining which laws violate it? if not then their opinion doesn't matter.	even with the supreme court ruling, sinjin and chet have said otherwise... on the day this was posted!
1	so, you admit defeat to a child? you have no argument and can only name call. answer my posts with something other than ad hominem or admit defeat.	if you have no answer to #64, please just concede.
1	So if it was deemed by 'those with the knowledge that give their opinion weight' that a fetus can feel pain and stress during a termination you would agree that the termination should not be carried out..well done	Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight...
1	Really? Well, when I have a kid, I'll be sure to just leave it in the woods, since it can apparently care for itself.	The key issue is that once children are born they are not physically dependent on a particular individual.
1	Balderdash! Atheism isn't science. That's nonsense. And science is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is.	Atheism, (thinly disguised as science) creates the hypothesis that there is no God, and works backwords [sic] to find evidence for only that hypothesis.
1	ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked. 'but of course.' he replied and with that...*poof* he was gone. that explains why he doesn't do anything. no miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...he's gone. and, for those fools who doubt this, i refer you to the book of job. witness how god jumps to the tune of satan when god withdraws his protection from his loyal and faithful servant...merely to prove a point to satan...without cause!	god can do anything.
0	You could've just as easily revived the last thread, commenting on how the antis are unusually silent.	At least Ian responded in a friendly way, and me and him don't even agree on this issue.
1	So, Steeeeve, I take it you are not for a FAIR society?   Is an unfair society a moral society? Please explain. I find it difficult to comprehend.	yes i believe in strict government regulation of business.
0	This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do.	What parts of the Bible are true, and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true?
0	Of course not. That battle has already been lost. Creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class, even when it is called "creation science" and the data is distorted and mininterpreted. The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board (and yes, they were YECs) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution, and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards.	I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase "Young Earth Creationists" in any official capacity, nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught.
1	So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders.	They just make people want to kill.
0	I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think thatthe terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not awareof any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris.	I thought at issue was simply the impossibility of determing precise data.
0	that explains it, post 60, page 4. look what comes up for me. i have my forums settings at 40 posts per page. post 121 which came up was the first post at the top of the page.  regarding ip's, the region/part of the country or world they are from can be determined, so i'll make you an additional offer; if he shows that both easyrider and my ip's are located in the same town in nh, i'll still agree to being banned. i say this not knowing where rider is from but i assume he doesn't live in my state.	either you didn't take a look at the link, or you did and your browser didn't take you to the bottom of the page ad you were too lazy to look for the post.
1	if you can find an impartial judge, i'll take you up.	I will take the position that they should not.
0	And you will cowardly ignore the validity of the difference, as you whine that there is one ...A person goes to the doctor, that information is NOT public information. A doctor / patient can claim doctor/patient confidentiality. It's a recognized and valid situation.But with the "knowthyneighbor", these polls are PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. The purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud.If you weren't so intent on trying to bash, you would recognize the obvious distinctions... emoticonXRolleyes	Now you will come up with some lame excuse for a difference between the two but in the end both are bad ways to deal with the issue.
0	But it's not detecting any "new" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye, but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver.	If a telescope can see a new color, how can we observe the information?
0	That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your "apple falling" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple.	The equivalent of ID is doing all the experiments with the apple, measuring the mass of the apple and the Earth, and figuring out gravity, publishing it, and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments, with no refutations or flaws, and then some people coming along and saying, "well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does, ever think of that?
0	Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.	which kills the women.it is not child birth that kills those women.it is an attempt to abort.if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died.Having a child, is not a trajedy... its just part of life.its not a wrongful burden... or a flaw of existance.. its nature.dah... do you even read what is being posted?-Mosheh Thezion
0	oh yeah i said that because what he said was a sweeping statement and i was just pointing out what he posted is not always the case.	i responded to you because you said 'i beg to differ'.
0	I hope I have already begun to change your mind.	I want to see the evidence.
1	Sheesh ! What a way to bring goodwill to all people in the world, "yearning" for democracy. And if I remember right Saddam was our toady during the first Reagan Administration. Hmmmmmm, wasn't George Herbert Walker Bu$h our Veep then ?	I got the number from the Documental Centre for Human Rights in Iraq, although I did some research on them and they are affiliated with the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, so they're not exactly Saddam friendly.Human Rights Watch puts the number at 290.000 deaths.The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
1	The fact that you think the 9-9-9 plan is good only proves you are as stupid as Herman Cain is. Maybe you and Grover Norquist can get with Herman Cain and start construction on Utopian dreamworld, and don't forget to stop by and pick up your other dumbass Ron Paul on your way .	If you pay attention to the papers or news you will have a heavy air of stupidity around you.
0	so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?	if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy works as long as you do it in the presence of gravity, but that smacks of a circular definition to me.
0	Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.	it may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if i have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, i will have to delete this first half and move it to the end.
0	Yes, it is, and I'll gladly excuse his grammar compared to my zero ability in Hungarian.	Seriously, is English your second language?
1	i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around.	you are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they aren't connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms.
1	that is an utter contradiction. he knows what is going to happen, but wants to preserve our freedom of choice? what freedom? please, explain so i can understand, this 'freedom' which gives rise to only one possible future! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny. no ifs, buts or maybes. this isn't about god deciding our future, it's about whether we can. well, that's one interpretation. another would be 'not sticking our heads in the sand'.	it basically means that god knows what's going to happen before it happens.
1	You know my answer: There is no god and no one "created" mankind. But the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under "Religious" or "Philosophy" section, not abortion.   Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?	You didn't mind commenting about God ('the Lord's prophets') just before I wrote my question above to you, so why are you running scared or bugging out now?Looks to me like you couldn't answer the question.
0	Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, "Turkana Boy" It is also sometimes called "Nariokotome Boy". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil.	I gave you the name and a thumbnail...if you aren't bright enough to go look at a bigger picture than I can't help you.
0	no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe.	if this were the case than non-humans that are biological alive should also have the right to life.
1	Yeah, cause there are sooo many 100 year old corks just kickin around.	The point is, how old the wine is, not the cork.
0	You said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. How is that a misinterpretation?   You're asking for proof of a negative. How many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? We don't know...   Erm.... You're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly. I'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class.	what i'm advocating is that we stop this naive belief that we can save lives by banning guns on and around school property, because the victims of columbine and virginia tech will tell you that this belief is wrong.

0	I didn't answer or you didn't understand? Actually I did answer. The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it. The skull, even though I gave it very ape-like features, is from a biped. There are many examples of what I described.	"Outside of a nutshell, you still didn't answer the question.
1	i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel	to me that makes sense as well, but i just wanted to clear up what it was saying.
1	what country are you from? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law. the legislature writes it, the executive approves it, and the judiciary interprets it. the people have no direct say what so ever.	its because if you want to change law you shouldn't be able to exploit the judiciary..you need to do it like everyone else has (up until 50yrs ago) which is go convince the people and run it like a democracy.
1	Not quite sure what you are talking about, Iangb. And I really don't have time to crack the code so if you have a specific question, just ask it already.	Hey, does this mean you've found a definition for 'life' that you like yet?

1	Why would I worry about a book of myths and fairy tales?	You will all have to bow down and confess Jesus is Lord once you meet him at the Judgment.Recommend you read Romans chapter 3.
1	So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized "Good morning, sweetie", that would be an answer?	You did not ask for a quote which says "we should ban guns" and you posed the question TO "anti-gunners" you did not ask for anti-gun comments.
1	Whose culture are we talking about, here?I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?	That "one iota" we're discussing is a major change: part of the very heart of what marriage is.
0	Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two.	You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.
0	So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant.	If they don't believe in what they're selling, why should I.
0	And where exactly did you hear this? I find it hard to believe a governent that couldn't keep an affair or a low-level break-in under wraps could keep something like that secret.................

1	Say hello to my little friend! We the people, through our State Governments!	Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox today threw his support behind the National Rifle Association's challenge of a City of Chicago ordinance banning possession of most handguns by filing a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court.Cox's amicus brief -- a document filed in court by someone not directly related to a case -- supports the request by the NRA to the Supreme Court for an appeal of the U.S.
0	as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'.	surely, then you are not saying that whole structures such as feet formed complete...that would be a contradiction now wouldn't it.....so answer my question: what about the feet?
1	making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists, with no real knowledge of their situation? archie has no problem. but when it comes to christianity, the obfuscational ploy of 'i don't know all the details' comes out, followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details. she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so. the bible lays out exclusive reasons for 'divorce'. this isn't one of them. this is yet another example of religious intolerance, even to the extent of violating their own religion.	well i was going from the guardian article which was rather more in depth on the specifics.
1	Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone?

Well, since the government passed the gun control laws that gun hater pilot wanted the government should be held responsible. That means the tax payer will pay for gun haters pilot gun free bs!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones at columbine can freely walk around and kill their victims!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones on 9/11 that used box cutters to take over airplanes crowed with people!	Or is that just your style, to avoid any questions that might make you think, keep twisting everyones words around, calling them gun haters and racists, and making yourself sound like a total XXX?
0	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.	Surely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism.

1	Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?	The truth is that all the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare.
0	Besides the hundreds of cases in which such things are directly observed, I guess you're right.	This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist.

0	pay attention. age of consent is still the topic and point. if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five-decimal point factor, that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good/bad societal interpretation designated by non-teens, would it not? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non-status unless those non-teens making the laws had another agenda.	is the question will education and contraception help reduce teen pregnancy?

1	Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers).	It is possible you had the title of Christian without the relationship which gives you this title.
1	What's that? Campaigning and use of taxpayer funded facilities like transportation for political purposes? I suppose they paid the cops for going out of their jurisdiction too?	Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda, and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value, but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that.
0	Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent. You said this:	Why must we make more assumptions based on what will happen in the next 10,000 years?

0	Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.	Why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when I offer my vote/opinion, I am imposing something evil on you?

IF he is writing as Lurch, and someone else comes onto a board, as Ungerdunn, who is just as rude (which is what you are saying), you assume it's the same person? Or, is it because they both claim to be biologists? I guess that having another person enter a forum, and claim to be a biologist would narrow it down to just the same person emoticonXClown All you've done is said you know it is him because one writer is as rude as the other... and that this gives his identity away by some mysterious process, probably I don't understand this as I've never read set-theory! emoticonXWow What should be a very easy question becomes you repeating "I know it is him".Also, has he been banned as Lurch on these other fora?

1	Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. Quick search reveals NO mentions at all. Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical.	And, whether it supports my POV, as I believe it does, is not the point.

1	Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.	If they had wings, they may be blown into the ocean and drown.
1	Even then, your statement does nothing. They aren't "getting themselves pregnant". A doctor is doing a medical procedure, that may or may not result in a pregnancy (ya know, those little sperm thingies?) emoticonXAngel	The number of people that do this is irrelevant, alls that counts is the very fact that it happens, and so it invalidates the the sweeping statement that suggested otherwise.
0	What are you talking about? Please define information. What does "new" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism.	Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information.
1	No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word "prayer?" Why not?

1	point me toward the right way then? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs. please tell us how creationists were wrong. i would gladly like to see you try!	Look at pretty much any post on this forum and you will see this.
1	Yawn, again you keep repeating this. You not only refute yourself by providing an example of knowledge of the unknowable, but you gave an example of what is unknowable, by telling me I'd never be able to know you!	You have claimed god is real, and unknowableTo claim knowledge of the unknowable is self-contradictory.

1	Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders.	In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders.

0	just a question, can someone show me where symbiote posted at all on the thread?  4forums.com political debates and polls - search results he's got 4 posts in the past day. none of which are about what cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08 says they are.  sorry giantorio for cluttering the forum. and thanks cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08, you just proved my point. when i prove you are wrong, you just change your argument and insult me for failing to prove your new argument you just created. you did this as yankee fan on lw. you did this here as cashburn. you're doing it again as roesgen08. same exact story.	- - one would think that someone (such as yourself) so concerned about people posting truthfully about other posters would do so in their own posts.........
1	I still haven't seen an adequate rebuttal to this. Why can't people marry themselves if they are in love with themselves?  I must have missed your response.	All they would need to say is "come on, everyone thought gay marriage would lead to the downfall of man, but it hasn't, and neither will legalized [insert marriage concept here]" Your argument is evidence of the gradual process you purport not to exist.
0	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.	Likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning.
1	oh no you didn't! not g earnst website?  oh yes you did! that would be like me quoting from nato's website.  po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie  potomac river humm.	perhaps you could clarify.
0	Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max.	I see far to many religious people that know absolutely nothing about the universe they live in as a result.
0	that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. were is the biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created. in fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. it is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat. pride caused the fall of the son of morning, not scientific discovery.	by the way how did lucifer become the devil??
0	The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.	why not?Life is cheap and I hold no silly notions.Science should be used to benefit life, not ignored.
0	Umm.. again they are identified as Messianic Jewish. Google 'Messianic Jewish' if you care, thousands of hits. So you now try to personally misidentify this 'Jewish' group on your own terms? A Messianic Jew is a Jewish person who believes that Yeshua (Jesus) is their Messiah. Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post. You seem to be inferring that I am suggesting that such 'change' means a change for ALL Jews, sic, obviously I am not suggesting that.	Can you tell me where in the New Testament it says that the Sabbath has to be done on Sunday?
0	In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use "his/her" or "he/she"... it just gets tiring after a while...)	Separating siamese twins where there is only one heart, allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area.
1	Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so "self-confident" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.	Do you think a blind man can make a watch?If you think he can I am not surprized that you think Mr. Dawkins has superb logic.
1	where did that happen, in your dreams? please note the word ' extreme'. extreme lefties have been just as blood thirsty as extreme righties.	then, we let all the remaining nutcases gather in their own corner so that they can babble amongst themselves.
0	Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible. I hardly consider a 1500 year old book "making clear what he wants". Particularly given that even among those who believe the book, they still can't agree on what God wants. And of course, that doesn't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible. You may personally believe that you know what God wants, but if so it's not because God has been clear about it.	I would say that if a diety can't go out of his way to demonstrate his existance and make clear what he wants This may surprise you, although we cannot observe not test this, God has come down to Earth many times throughout human history.
1	That's like looking at a rainbow and insisting it only has the color red in it.	See I view human sexuality as being the exclusive province of the monogamous heterosexual marriage bond.
1	then why have you attacked kerry and other democrats for voting aganist abortion bills that did not have such clauses?  oh yes, i know why, because you're a lying hypocrite.	i think it goes without saying that any time the mother's life is endangered then and abortion can take place............ as far as rape and incest if and abortion has to take place lets hope that it is before the last 3 months of the pregnancy........
0	d. adams? :)  this is, of course, an entire debate unto itself. i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere. but that it's probable? we simply don't have the data to make that leap. we've got some good theories about how life started here, but we don't know exactly what happened. and even if we did, we don't know how common those conditions are 'out there'. if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years, and for all we know they might be, than we may well be the only life in the universe. logically, we just can't say. we don't have enough info to apply logic to the problem.	space is really, really big, so big it bigger than you can think of big.
0	Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment.	The monks?
0	Depends on the usage. Generally, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population.	Does the term "evolution" refer to ONLY the "advances" of life over time?
0	You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt.	Common sense says that if we are all on a downhill slide that mutation/selection – being the conservative/degenerative devicees that they are -- could have never have explained the origin of anything.
0	I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood	My point wasn't to show that the unborn is a person but to show that the real question isn't "Who gets to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy, the woman herself or some nameless faceless bureaucrat?"
1	wow, there you go again. first we can cut health care costs by hiring lots and lots of doctors and nurses and building lots more hospitals... which have to be, you know, paid for. now we can cut postal rates by hiring lots and lots more delivery people! who have to be, you know, paid. in your view it seems that any cost can be reduced by spending more money... it's fascinating really.	ups and fedex would hire more people where they would be able to cover the vast plains of the united states.
0	This is the most asinine argument yet. The man was making six figures as a radio talk show host. Why would he leave that job to hit the road for 18 hour days away from family merely in the hopes of hawking a few extra books? He had an ESTABLISHED platform to sell boks viz a viz his radio show, his frequent substitutions on other programs, and his status as a darling of the Tea Party. The man could line up paid speaking engagements to hawk his book. Why would he trade that for unpaid speaking engagements to hawk his book?	und the country using those talking points without any actual knowledge of what he's even talking about, and when confronted with the reality that he knows less than a rock about any given subject... well that's just stupid.
1	You would say that, because you are neither a woman, nor gay. Families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist by the way, and women and children had few rights. The family structure was "secure" that way. Yes, the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage, is just such a good thing in and of itself. This meant fewer people burning in hell, which is what is really important.emoticonXRolleyes	I wouldn't want to go back to that time, but it definitely had it's pluses.
0	Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.	It has been addressed several times on this forum and the best evidence available shows that effect B is greater than C.
0	In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic "mutation" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained.	If this mutation is random doesn't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as, in the long run, only the offspring of the mutated species would survive?
1	I think you're VERY mistaken.I'm not a republican. Nor a democrat.Never been registered as anything other than 'independent'.I'm such because I think.Unlike a party parrot that you seem to be yourself.Since I'm neither...who the hell can "I" be in the minority?Must be your biggoted knee-jerk reaction to think that anyone who doesn't think like you and slurp the Flavor Aid is the opposition and as such must be in the 'enemy party'.And you are a hater because you verbiage is hate filled, caustic and ever insulting. And not in a funny, jestful way but full of vitriol and bile.	You do a good job of regurgitating all the Reichwing talking points.
0	One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies.	is it that creationists are making assertions without understanding what they are talking about?
1	I would argue against this but I would need to introduce subjectivism into the argument. lolemoticonXCensored	It's the principle, not whether the organism is sentient at that exact moment, but whether it as a category (species) is sentient.A sleeping person doesn't lose their rights because they can't pass the mirror test unconscious.
1	Are you kidding me?! You think that blacks living in Third World Carribean and African countries are "content?!" They're starving by the tens of thousands per day or living so far below the poverty level that it's unimaginable. Maybe you should wander off the beach sometime and see for yourself.	yes criminals existed, but not in the rampant way we see today.
1	But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?	In Genesis, humans are created seperately from all other creatures, but apes and monkeys are not specifically mentioned.
0	You can do so, and if I don't check your source I guess I'm SOL, eh? I've seen the story many places, but this is beyond simply a site dedicated to outing Bush since its a radio show :P	All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past.
0	They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?	I see no duplicity between the two.
1	Functioning? The fetus breathes freely? It cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable? It demands attention? It smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it?  Wow! Didn't know that fetuses were that active and functional.	but that only makes sense when the womb is empty.
1	funny how all those previously plentiful miracles, burning bushes, and personal appearances dropped off so suddenly 2000+ years ago... innit? enquiring minds want to know. non-enquiring minds don't want to enquire.	i mean i'm not asking for anything more than a personal appearance.
0	Well you don't need to doubt it. I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need.	Granted these are all not necessarily plausible, but never-the-less they are just as plaussible that the dog was subject to a random bout of evolution.Further, you said..."Just to show what my personal feelings are on God, if I seen him appear in the sky right now and waved at me, I'd drop all my previous ideas and accept that he exists without hesitation.
1	And you offer none for your's. Heteros engage is risky business as well. Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage.   It's not just STD's, it's all sorts of physical issues as well. Cancers, hepatitus, bacterial infections, that result from anal and vagina sex. Add one word and BAM, it works aganist you.	Thats what I thought..... no defense for your perverse behavior.
0	Very well said. However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected. That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights. However, safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense.	It worked just fine for the first half of the 20th century.And training should never be a requirement for exercising a constitutional right.
1	Don't get your panties in a wad, 38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control this clown can dream up.	The Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer of the nation, is "the enemy", but this is not paranoia.
0	How do we know anything for sure? We can't be certain of the Earth's age in billions of years, but we can use carbon dating to figure out it's older then 55,000 years, which refutes creationism.	#4 - How do we know without a doubt the world is billions of years old?
0	Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us.	Global warming may or may not be the result of what humans are doing, although it sure isn't helped by our destorying the environment.
0	...i usually go to the one on morena. and heres why i'm telling you: it's a big ass world out there and you don't know what i look like. also, it's a fantastic costco and i'm proud to shop there.	btw, which costco do you go to ;)
0	You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?And to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?Smiley	What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death.
1	You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts.	I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime.
0	So what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions.	Either way, the theory of evolution can explain the DNA change with fewer assumptions.
0	You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience. A discussion about the various methods (and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html	If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest.
0	I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.	Removal of body parts by whatever means does not change the dna of the rest of the body.
0	Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is "treating them as breeding animals". Kind of an odd thought.	No, it doesn't make it right but it's not right to treat women as breeding animals either.
0	Our side? I don't get the impression we're on the same side.Besides, I think the subject is decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies.	Yeah if we could get a good portion of the pro-life people on our side we might stand a pretty good chance of significantly decreasing the amount of abortions.
1	Wow, what a group of rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error. I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are. That's why the bible say's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God.	In terms of our lives, that's not important.It amazes me just how dumb creationists are.
0	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.  In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work.	S Africa has the most restrictive gun laws on the planet.
1	O.K. lets' play your game. Gun control has worked exactly WHERE?	I agree with this but you have to remember what works in one place may not work in another and visa versa.
0	No, the question is why you let violent individuals remain free in public.	The key question is, really, whether guns make violent events more lethal.
1	Oh, it gave me quite a shock when that happened! I wasn't expecting it at all! emoticonXRolleyes	Tell me Dzeron, are you at all suprised when provided the means to prove his claim, VOR fails horribly?
1	Oh, so this only happens here, huh? Every single hardcore drug addict is here, huh?	Not a coincidence, just a stupid population to look at to understand whether marijuana does or does not lead to "harder" drugs.
0	Because Humphreys went out looking? How many should we allegedly find?	There are not enough stone-age skeletons ...
1	The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.	It doesn't agree with the study done by the Violence Policy Center.
0	Yes California is following European socialism. Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes.	You need look no further than the current state of California to realized that the United States is heading towards socialism just as Europe has in the past few decades.
0	Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers.	Losing a fetus should not be a big deal to the pro choice lot on this forum, considering the effort they put into arguing that a fetus is either the equivalent of a parasite or a piece of tissue with no value .
1	Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure.	He was arrested and spent several hours in a cell when plainly he had not broken any laws.
0	prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator.	when have liberals ever been upset and outraged over a criminal being given a deal?
0	that's fantastic! i say you go for it, and... um... pics or it didn't happen.	i think he's nuts!
0	Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.	variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation.
1	Sure you don't want to address the gaping holes in your argument. That's up to you.	All right, I'm not going to bother picking this apart line-by-line every day....
0	oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free-will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise. there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it. but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free-will i have not bothered to collect it. humans do not have free-will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of.	regardless you still put forth a premse in your rebuttal which is not subject to either proof or disproof.
0	[quote=mae] land that didn't belong to the un or israel. or current american aggression? what's the difference? both are imposing their ideologies by force. you make it sound like choosing a sports team; for or against based on personal opinion.	[quote=georged] 1) crucial difference is that the un gave israel a piece of land in the middle east.... not so for china in tibet.
0	rrriiigggghhhtttt.... do you really think your opposition to ending medicare / medicaid would just come from the recipients? no. it's like kids being afraid of getting their haircut. it's much adieu over nothing. and then when the haircut is done, they realize it's not as bad as they made it out to be... and they eventually recognize the need for the haircut...	anybody honest enough to denounce our socialist leaning predecessors in congress and the whitehouse could never get enough financial support from those that suckle off the gov't teat calling themselves 'democrats' of all things.
1	But if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. You are a rightwing hypocrite, Archie Baby.	It should also be noted that according to the Mass Constitution, the people have always voted on such issues.
1	Well, I guess this all just proves that more brain dead crack babies are surviving than I originally thought.	I think I should move to another country.
0	this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional.	scotus could rule that ffca isn't applicable because it is a license issue and not a statute.
1	Is this another attempt of yours to paint all that believe in smaller, less-intrusive government as loonies? Very transparent, sorry. :(	Your anger isolates you.Your vitriol isolates you.And furthermore, to quote Mr Williams..."Until he embraces the whole country what else can I conclude"Bush catered to the Republican extreme minority on a variety of issues.Where the heck was this talk then??
1	wow, good response. you know, attacking foul language instead of making a proper rebuttal makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.	throwing out the f bomb doesn't lend you any weight; it just makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.
0	It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.	On the subject of analogies for genetic information, would "computer language" (code) be a better analogy?Indeed mutation and evolution *could* be shown with computer viruses.Of course this would require some familiarity with computer code.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language
1	To summarize, since penfolds reasoning has been shown to be both ignorant and short sighted, his only recourse is to offer a trollish quip before skulking away like the irrational philosophical coward that he is. At least you're consistent penfold. emoticonXRolleyes	I defer to your greater personal knowledge of the depths of ignorance.
0	Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. "judicial fiat" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals.	But that of course is the fear that many have, i.e., that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat (whether at the state or federal level) rather than through legislative means.
1	wow many false gods beat an actual one. christinity may only believe in one god, the god.	they could easily defeat the father, the son, and the holy ghost.
0	Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual. What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for "walking in a mile in another's shoes". Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?	I do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother's life is in danger, otherwise they should live with it.
1	And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing. Science should teach currently held theory.	While most of the commonly held conjecture certainly fits the evidence at hand, there may be other explanations, explanations we have not even thought of yet, that also fit the evidence.
1	So says a ghoul who delights in digging up the body of a dead man.	You do realize that the man that Brown is replacing was a drunk that killed a young woman, went home to sleep it off and THEN reported it to police 8 hours later, right?By Kennedy standards, almost anybody is a step up the moral ladder.
0	yeah horses are so cute i love it when they eat sugar right out of my hands it's so tickly	horses are my favorite animal.
0	You benefit from all of these. They may not be direct benefits or even benefits you want but when it exists we all benefit. Frankly, the IRS is just an idiotic one. Your whole argument only works if you have the IRS to enforce these policies. Could we go without SS and Public education? Probably, but I prefer a system where society decides on what is a "public good" and we go with that.	Social security, IRS, EPA, the public school system are at the top of my list.
1	I'm not a "TROLL" unless of course disagreeing or believing differently from you makes me one. If so then I wear the title with pride.	If they are not trolls, then ignoring them may give them the time to focus and actually respond to some of the posts in an intelligent manner.
0	this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic	God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature.
1	Whatever. emoticonXRolleyes I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here, but that's up to you.	I think part of the problem is that you don't need to "explain" that to me at all.THAT is my point.You consistently criticize the gay side for not acknowledging that it's their "belief", but you are repeatedly "not addressing" their side regarding the ACCURACY of their belief.
1	And Anarchy. Am I allowed to kill someone if I feel like it ?	Voting isn't a third way, it is the rule of the majority by virtue of their posession of the greatest force.It is where voting does not decide, but where individuals are allowed to decide for themselves, that there is freedom and justice.
1	Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions?   Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?	Can you guarantee that what appears to be a simple mugging will come to an immediate halt once the mugger is complied with, and that he won't push for more than mere material goods?
0	So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?

0	I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. "Evolutionism" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?	the notion that the bible is completely and uncompromisingly true is paramount to christianity.with all that in consideration, it should be no surprise that christians will do everything possible to show evolution as false
1	And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be.

0	Marriage is a secular condition set up by various Societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders.Religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it.You don't curse the Church you lobby Society to see if you can effect a change. People who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change.	BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry.
0	You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.	What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education.

If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she can abstain from sex.
0	I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the "I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me".So yes, I "a real pro-choicer" agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type.	then why can't a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue is just that a mass a tissue.
0	Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.	It appears to me, that if slavery had been put up to a vote in Texas back before the civil war, and Texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks (which they would have), you could as simply say "Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it IS."
0	marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence.	it would keep you from getting the federal benefits--the legal context.
1	oh yes liberal: anyone who disagrees with vor regardless of their political standing. you would call frist a liberal if he disagreed with you, hell you would even goldwater a liberal if he disagreed with you.  i'm going to mentally replace farfignewgin whenever you say liberal, after all, they have the same meaning in your context.  you can support the troops by disagreeing with any mission that is unncessary in terms of security and any mission that puts troops in unncessary danger. explain to me how you can support the troops by supporting a mission that doesn't help america and gets 1600 of them needlessly killed.	so let me understand this from you libs..........you can support the troops but hope their mission fails?
1	Yep, you libs would love that. Then you could party on end without having your carnal consciences tweaked, LOL! No sin then no need for a Savior.

1	orion's follies: some other goodies from that site... never linked to those specific articles.  but before orion gets too self-righteous, let's look at some ot the topics he considered 'funny' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum: christian crimes - pastor molests widow's boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush's faith-based failure - pastor molest, guns, drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd's 'white ('n' word)'  is this funny? it's apparently real funny to orion. his link also had a pornographic sub-link on the virgin mary, describing her in graphic, profane language.  orion - christ-deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help.	one of his more assinine attempts at intelligent design.
1	Then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. He was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. It was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. He made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. Bush doesn't send kids to Iraq. First of all they volunteer. Second of all, they are older than 18. Please let me know what comments Michael Moore made that you thought were worthy. You might have trouble.	I thought for sure that he would be "outfoxed" to use a pun.
0	So now Wiesmann's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree, but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution...	Wiesmann's barrier has been breached, and in many different forms, some of which I mentioned already (see box 2).
0	i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right.	and here is a link that puts all those quotes in context.
1	Except, of course, the evidence is totally against that. Plus, there is the little matter of infant mortality... and lack of resources.   But hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you.	I'm not sure of the correct time, but there is nothing that says it couldn't have happened in that time period.
1	If you can't prove or deal in absolutes, then the basis of your argument, the "absolute" nature of logic, just became pretty shaky.	i can not prove 100% that God exist, the atheist can not prove100% that God does not exist because absolute proof is not posible.
1	Non-aggressive, yeah. That's why it's Israel that's the occupying force in Palestine and not the other way around. emoticonXWow	Simple, because Israel is a non aggressive Country surrounded by 13 very aggressive Countries who not only vowed to destroy her but have combined their military forces multiple times to try just that.
1	Yes. So you are indeed committing the genetic fallacy. And apparently unaware of the semantic ambiguity of the sixth commandment. Thanks for clarifying.	Ok. you dont have a clue where your morals come from ..is that comprehensible?You are not clear what the sixth commandment means..is that also comprehensible?
0	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.	Yeah, that's generally the conclusion that I come to which is why I see nothing wrong with abortion.

0	i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.	so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it?
0	No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat. To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers. None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing. But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin.	In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.

0	if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?	the 14th amendment further says that the states cannot pass any laws the abridge the rights you have as a federal citizen so a state cannot pass a law either that gives preference to a different faith than your own, the same limitation as the federal government.

1	reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could.	-reproduction  - if the person is religious (i do not believe god will send gay believers to hell, not sure about atheists)  - if he wants to.

0	Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.	We fundamentally disagree there.How long have you been arguing the gay marriage issue.And you state that you SUPPORT equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold-out, right?If YOUR mind can't be changed in all that time, why do you think that we could win over the nation just by having Democrats come out hot and heavy.Furthermore, THINK about it.HOW LONG have we been pushing for ENDA...And we just tried the vote, and it failed...EVEN ON THE ISSUE THAT HAS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORT, the anti-gays are able to stop the win.What do you think will happen on an issue we DO NOT have majority support on?

0	And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because "we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact.	Gravity is a fact because we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it.

There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a "fully developed" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were "totally useless", is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions.	When they reach their fully evolved form, they may have been of use, but until then, they could serve no purpose, and help the dino in no way at all, serving only as excess weight, and larger profile, hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement.

It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses. Different personalites process and categorize information in different ways. Unfortunately for many children, this is one of them. :( And unfortunately I'm speaking from experience.	Do you really believe not spanking your children will make them less likely to hit other children?
1	Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it.	A third or fourth eye is simply a copy of an existing body part.If it's a FIRST eye that evolved, then that'd count.You can't create anything new by creating copies.
1	so, clive, everyone that believes that god created the earth is an idiot? you need to spend some quality time with some that do and i think you'd change your tune.	he's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing xxxxxx that you get frequenting these boards (i can't say i blame him on the latter point).
0	Common sense? A collection of human cells as yet not developed enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human being? Uncommon sense IMO. Just the use of the term "unborn" is ridiculous. Are the rest of us the "undead"?	I don't subscribe to ANY religion.It is just common sense that murdering an unborn human being is wrong.
0	You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.	I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake.

0	I've been posting at least a few times a week. That's a lot more than once a month. I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. I think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked.	You come around about once a month, scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun, and you use that single incident as if it's evidence that there's a serious problem that threatens the entire nation.
1	Gee, and in what year did he state that? 2005? No way. 2000? No. 1995? Nope. 1990? Nah. 1985? Couldn't be. Without more information I can give an exact date, but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984, he must have said that at least 21 years ago (and if he said it in the middle of his life/career, it would have been more like 60 years ago!) - he did not know back then what we now know.	Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”50

0	The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .	In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation.
0	Why can't you answer questions directly?anyway, I support ct in passing civil unions or marriage lite as I like to see it, but It doesn't confer equality. If it is really equ8al than it would be marrige. Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that, but we don't so far and we cannot ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage.)If it is good for straight couples, it should be equally good for all couples. . No one is more superior. Everyone should be equal. Marriage for all is equals.	So you don't support Connecticut passing a civil union law?

0	Those who set the rules can do with them as they please. It isn't illogical nor hypocritical. It IS illogical to assume you can chew gum if the rule is "you cant chew gum" and the teacher allows one student to chew gum.	It would be bad enough if it was just the teacher chewing gum and telling the students don't chew gum.
1	Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???	Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right because of a physical feature is more like the slave traders than everything.

0	As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?	There is a right to own property and to travel as recognized by the US Supreme Court.
0	Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals.	While anyone can accept that a “perfect” judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before.

0	Actually, it's true. One Darwin's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection.	False and that doesn't invalide evolution given how it's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory.
0	And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?	The Christians who want to teach Intelligent Design in schools are an extreme minority that the media, in all its story-searching rating-mongering glory, is blowing out of proportion.
0	Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.	and the lie that the embro has gill slits.
0	so what you're saying is that you can't?  as a political move to satisfy the pro-life constituents that put them in office.	i don't have to do that.........if there were not abortions being performed in the 3rd trimester then why would the u.s. senate pass a bill banning it?
0	Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.	He is a prime example of what I mean.

0	unkerpaulie, thank you for this explanation. boing! eureka! i have finally concretely grasped what a 'strawman' argument is. creating something that does not exist. making mock, in a sense. sorry, i just have to reiterate the term in my terms to paste it firmly into place in my cranium.	i suggest you wait for someone to make a statement then attack/address it, rather than presuming statements that were not made and arguing against them.

0	ooo, the slippery slope argument! always a classic. the right to not be discriminated against based on her sexual orientation perhaps? what part of the dress code was she going to violate? she was going to wear formal wear. it's not like she was going to show up in ripped jeans and a slipknot t-shirt. rules designed to exclude her. their wishes don't supersede her rights.	what right was she standing up for exactly?
0	by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god.	individuals within the church are to use their god given gifts for the building up of the body to love one another and show the world what love is.

0	But is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder? It's pretty easy to find information on the FBI and the CDC websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings. People defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership, not the net benefit when it comes to safety. That would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative.	More importantly, when one gets into a car, they know that they run the risk of crashing.

0	To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition', sure. But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect.	That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition.

Perhaps you should reconsider since you're getting your ar$e handed to you with every reply I write. ;)	My dear Archangel, I wasn't aware that I was required, when I visit these forums (especially when I'm low on time like I was then, and only posted to something that caught my eye and then got off the internet), to check each and every thread to see if you graced it with your presence and to respond to that instantly.A Thousand Apologies, My Lord.
0	Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.	There's no difference between Christian Creationism/ ID and the Wapuri warrior ideal creation myth which focuses on the divine Parrot.If you are focusing on Christian creationism vs Evolution, there is more than one system of creation, and it doesn't necessarily revolve around one omnipotent, omniscient being.
0	Iangb, I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims. I also thought that (by now) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in (in this thread or by private message) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest.' At this point, I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood's definitions?

0	Well, it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain.	I am left with having to trust scientists to distinguish between the two and scientists seem to agree that one needs a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order to register pain - which does not happen until the start of the third trimester.

1	First of all a man cannot terminate tissue he isn't carrying.The father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is.	If a woman who is pregnant with a few "cell clusters" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation.
0	theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them. so i guess yes, its 50/50 so more or less half of these are likely to exist right? every imaginary thing that i could make up, half of that is probable to existing if they all can't be proven or disproven?	big foot, dragons, unicorns, mermaids, there are scientific factors that makes their existence unlikely to live in the current environment.
0	insult? i'm not sure if you're joking or just have a bad memory. but you have been making false assumptions 'aka' insulting me also. i'm not trying to insult you. i'm simply dishing out just like you are buddy. and i don't have to back up anything to a stranger i'll never meet. i know how successful i am and what degrees i have. all these false assumptions you're coming up with aren't phasing me at all. stop dishing out if you cant take it.	they still let old people like you get a ged, so i think you better get one as soon as possible.
0	exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him.	in fact, it's probable, given his devotion to science and reason, that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration.
1	Like you were raised? Looks like it didn't work and now those hormones must be kicking in? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax...their favorite victims? Males.	That would be beating the bejesus out of a kid as opposed to teaching him or her how to govern his or her impulses by themselves.
1	Calling someone a "liar", "fool hardy", "[corrupter] of the truth", and unobjective is considered complimentary where you come from? Odd, but OK, I'll go with it you lying brainwashed fool (hey, this is fun! I like using Archie's compliments!).Actually, my "sick hypothetical" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry "Corrupter! Blasphemer!" and run away. Is this your idea of "witnessing"? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat.	And regarding your sick hypothetical, it isn't a valid question at all as its based on lytes unproven third hand slander, so I see no reason to play a what if game with someone who only seeks to corrupt the truth rather than discover what it is.
1	Let's allow same-sex marriage only. Then heterosexuals will have the same right to marry someone of the same sex.	To me it has nothing to do with equal or civil rights.........It is a special right that gays want....They already have the same rights I have when it comes to marriage......They can marry anyone of the opposite sex...
1	Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?	What's the scoop here?It seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the United States because of all the gun happy nuts running around, everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting.Good idea simone, when do you start your training.I understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they're deep.

0	'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.

Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision.	When was the last time a man's life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant?
0	What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes "conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift.	But I would love to see you try and explain how 30 months in prison, a felony conviction record, and $5,000 in fines for buying two guns in one month is fair, reasonable, tough on crime, and constitutional in nature.

1	No EasyRidden.. It's you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution. America is a nation which has always had a population of christians, but it was never a Christian nation. The Words God, Jebus, Holy Spirit.. are NOT included in any of the founding documents. You can continue to ignore the history, you're the one looking like a buffoon.	Considering you left-wingers have been wearing out lawyers for the last 100 years trying to get all the vestiges of Christianity erased from our halls of government, our history books, etc., America must have been more of a Christian nation than you will ever admit.

0	You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be. This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs.	by gun nut logic children should be able to tote guns around at school because it wont make a difference because if they really wanted to kill each other, theyll just find another way to do it if they dont got guns because you know what guns dont kill people, people kill people!

0	Huh? With a 26" barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards. With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500, but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 (1.51 miles).	Then again that might be wrong and these short action calibers might have a 1,500 meter effective range, meaning that the claimed abilities of the .50 BMG are mediocre in comparison.

0	what makes you think they're not true? jesus arose from the dead. that's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not.  many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale. none succeeded and a number became believers. you guys are playing with absolute fire. if you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. big time and forever. do you feel lucky? well, do you?	for someone seemingly hellbent on accusing atheists of not understanding any other points of view, it's pretty damn idiotic to threaten us with assertions that we know aren't true.

I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.	It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
1	if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane. 'i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.' so you want the government to brainwash them?  are you kidding me? what planet do you live on?! 'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?	i don't think that killing people as a form of punishment is setting a very good example to the rest of the world - if the public start to see authorities giving people death penalties, everybody will just think that killing is ok and it will be a vicious circle!
0	Actually, I don't have any respect for creationism in most of it's varied forms. I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met. But they earned that respect.	Man, you don't have any respect for your opponents.
0	"A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon."The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm."In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'"The News regrets the error."CORRECTION	Ridiculous paperwork traps that even caught and surprised the Queen of gun control!
0	Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another, but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body. They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations' as if that justifies anything. There are things that cannot be morally obligated, no matter the relationship, so the argument tries to prove.	Blood relationships are never based on choice, yet they entail moral obligations, nonetheless.
0	could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess.	i did say that if birth control failed (condoms do sometimes too, i think their effectiveness is at like 97%, but that's not 100%) abortion should be acceptable.
0	People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things.	So if Utah made a law or a governor stated that christians didn't need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws?
1	Where, exactly, did the article say that bacteria exhibit intelligence????	Life at every level -- from humans down to bacteria -- exhibit intelligence and very often cooperation.
1	So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?   If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?   If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?   You are confusing me. Please explain.	the infirtle couples who want to have children and are capable of doing so with sciencetific methods may be married.
0	final, switzerland 1 spain 0. spain, one of the favorites or perhaps the favorite to win the world cup, loses to switzerland. what a shocker. of course with two more matches for all teams in this group anything can happen, but the pressure is on spain. they can not afford to lose another game, even a tie could mean not getting to the round of sixteen.emoticonxwow	that will go down in world cup history, especially if the loss of two points causes england to miss the final 16. i shouldn't have happened, but it did and the poor guy will live with it for the rest of his life.
0	I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The "you believe in evolution" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that.	I don't think this approach is all that new, but I have to admit that I haven't been around as many of the old-school creationists.
1	Oh yeah right, like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them, can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling.	She thinks the university's leaders should have been more open about their failure to provide the killer with adequate counselling, among other things.
1	and mythology. you forgot mythology. for example, the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths. and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed. and, of course, the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology. do you know what logic is? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy, not logic. the myths of noah are not history. and since we are talking about noah, i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed. and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history.	also, the old testament is a testament of history and prophesy while the new testament is a history of the life of jesus, the stories he told, and the letters written to churches about him.
1	Ok genius, explain to me how come it is that I dont believe in monsters, in ghosts,in luck,the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, and so many other things that a lot of people believe in, but yet I believe in God. Do I have some deep seated delusional fantasy or something like that. You seem to be wise and all knowing( maybe all powerfull as well). Yep, im convinced you are a legend in your own mind. You believe what you will, and I will do the same, and in the end we will see who is right and who is not.	I have heard that 'I used to be an atheist' nonsense by so many, yet I don't see the understanding about what it means to be an 'atheist'.
0	Considering your previous comment, that isn't you. Once again, that opinion is based upon who you read.	Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.
1	Isn't the point pretty obvious- that exposure to a gun can raise testosterone levels and trigger violent and aggressive thoughts and actions?	Posting nonsense like this proves nothing, other than the fact that you're an internet troll.
0	then why is it that closeted homosexuals that are completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate? they aren't persecuted or harassed at all since no one knows they are even having these feeling? it is self loathing that feeds their desire to harm themselves. people who know that what they are is right and good, don't harm themselves at all, but defend and support who they are even when persecuted by others. that's how it was for me when i converted from islam to christianity. all of the persecution i received just made me stronger.	umm no we feel these things because were indoctrinated by your pastors, your prayer leaders, and grow up feeling like were scum because you people have nothing better to do than scapegoat others to make your own crazed beliefs more believable.
1	So you are truthful, but I am a liar. Just like you are clever, but I am stupid. You have no respect for me, WW; I've never seen you demonstrate respect for anyone.	Why would you doubt me?
0	You lie. You keep saying the same things over and over again, that doesn't make them true. Your addiction to violence is showing.Tony Martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away. That's not self-defence, that's cold blooded murder.It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them. You don't get to take the law into your own hands. Munir Hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street. That's not self-defence, that's revenge.	Something like this belongs in the crime debate area, where I'm currently handing Jo his head over and over again.
1	Wow that worked well. Please explain where his logic is flawed in the point he made. You cant, because its not. This just proves how much this "point" along with all your other arguments have "flaws in logic" if you will.	This "point" is just mocking the other poster for flaws in logic.
0	Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.      In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak.	in fact, i have never witnessed anyone basing their entire gun control argument on the fact that 'gun owners lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand-to-hand combat.'
0	"Ready to go", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.Barbarian, regarding mutations:There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? .	So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go.
0	How about getting the government out of marriage entirely? That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry.	On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it's accepted standard in this country?
0	well, i can't say that i'm surprised. just another politician for ya. they're all the same.	remember a little while ago when the quite conservative governor of the quite conservative texas, rick perry, ordered that school girls receive the vaccine that can prevent cervical cancer?
1	i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!	you don't seem to want a written constitution either, or at least one that isn't as vauge as ours.
1	You resort to the Bible, just in whatever way is convenient to what you want it to say. Just like fundies do. Zardoz, the problem is that when you play devil's advocate (which you like to do), you ONLY take a fundie approach toward the scriptures. In fact, you're often more fundamentalist in the way you approach scripture than fundamentalists. You'd make a good fundie, the best of them, I suppose.	Just like Arch does.I counter that and use the scripture (which is good for the education in all things) to show what these 'believers' should have done.Now, if you want to actually study your bible and use contradictorary verses to support your stance, feel free.That'd just support the concept that the bible is self-contradicting.
1	The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot.	you could probably start by not calling the majority of people anti-moral, anti-family, anti-equality, anti-American, homophobes.But thats just me emoticonXRolleyes
1	probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.	Why don't you try to make George Walker Bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroying the nation of Iraq, for murdering tens of thousands of innocent women and children, for causing the deaths of nearly 3,000 young Americans who left behind mourning mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, in some cases many children who will be left to the mercy of our nation's horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their lives.
1	Because the soundbite "survival of the fittest" was coined to explain evolution to the stupid masses.	And where does the macroevolution feature in that combination?
0	Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge).	They aren't like puppies or chickens, can't get them fixed or make bar b que out of them.
1	Maybe you are and maybe you are not. You can criticize but there again you may incur the wrath of ole Doc too. emoticonXSmilie	What you choose to do about your laws is up to you.
1	He killed thousands of failed athletes? I must have missed this in the news.	I suppose his shooting of failed athletes was okay by you, also.
1	No. Not only are you wrong, you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. You oppose evolution you say, but you have no idea of what it is. Most educated creationists not only admit evolution, they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh.	You tell me that Job and Jonah are fiction.
1	oh yeah, all the most famous scientists, composers, writers, bands. all girls of course.... no, not really. yeah whitney huston, obviously way bigger than the rolling stones, beatles, who, led zeplin...... yeah great. take a step back, and read some good literature, you might learn something, un biased. opera the most powerful woman on earth> if she is, why will she die in the next 30-40 years, and how come i had never even heard of her until a little while back? how come, if she is so powerful, she is not out curing terminal diseases. oh i guess sitting on some leather sofa trying to get more ratings is way better!	oh that is a sad thing to believe :p dear boy (obviously) whitney houston beats michael jackosn demi lovato beats justin bieber karen carpenter beats every singer on earth<3 opera is the most powerfull woman on earth, obama is said to be the most powerfull man on earth, but i seriously think that opera wins this one too.
1	It might be telling that super heroes typically don't use firearms. That I'd prefer my crowds to have few if any guns concealed within hardly makes me pro-crime. Nor does it make me a pacifist. I'm a big fan of violence. The hands on kind.	He would also break the speed limit, but not run a stop light...but he protected innocent people with violence toward criminals.
1	i am surprised scientists havn't made so much of a fuss about you. wow......	is that like a dude + a pony?
0	Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.	Or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage?
0	good questions. its not a condition, i don't agree.  jesus doesn't open the lock to the pearly-gates for some people, he is the gate. do you see what i mean? that's what he said, 'i am the way... no one comes to the father except through me'. i think its like saying you shouldn't put conditions on the way into a house, you should be able to walk in from any spot - and saying that having to go through the door is a condition. why would people not choose heaven? its a hard road.	i know, you're going to say that people are refusing to go when they don't accept god, jesus into their lives.
1	You still don't get it do you, Smiley... emoticonXBanghead If cupcakes were human? It would.	This does not make it an individual (noun).
0	So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.	When San Jose, California, police test-fired an Uzi, a 30-round magazine was emptied in slightly less than two seconds on full automatic, while the same magazine was emptied in jus
1	Well, I guess you got something there. . . . . .can't put the cart before the hose!!	Yo shush yo mouth!Doncha knows that tha bible is fo believahs!Yas gotta believah furst!That's right, if you read it without believing first, you'll see the flaws and contradictions.
1	Are you jealous because they won't let you out of the institution while gansao get's to run all over the place?	What are you calling it?Are you simply jealous because you lack writing skills and no one has considered you for anything outside of menial labor?
1	Are you trying to be funny in a "I'm the one who drew attention to this aspect in the first place, but now I'm going to criticize you for talking about what I drew attention to" type mentality?	Focus on the reason for the arrest rather than the issue that caused his refusal to leave.
0	I would be interested to see where I made such a claim. Prove your assertion.	Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as "assault weapons" are "inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip".
1	Actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. And anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides.	The same history that led John Major and Anthony Blair to apologize to the Irish people.
0	Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.	The bill would also protect gun manufacturers and dealers that have allowed their weapons to fall into the hands of criminals through their own negligence.
1	thats true. i helped. my next bible will be 10 times better if i get around to finishing it	The Bible was written by many of the wisest men in history.
1	accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'.	you attack bp by focusing on its mistakes so that it can be held accountable by trial.
1	What difference does it make? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents? If so doesn't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas?	Like, how many shooting in Germany?Like, what's the ratio of shootings to population in the two nations of Germany and the U.S?
0	once again when is my life, what i do, and who i love, who i marry, any more thier business then theirs is to me? you still haven't answered my question. why do they get a say in my life yet i don't get the same say in their lives? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious xxxxxx are is just cruel and evil. it is my life my family not theirs. they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust. you are defending an unjust system.	people aren't going to stop standing up for what they believe in, and doing what they think is right.
0	What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842).	BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!
0	if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing.	ok, lets use that logic.... to the gay folks i say marry a woman.
0	I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.	We do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation.As for the secular rights, I don't think this is right.From a religious standpoint, I've never seen more ignorance, hatred or twisted lies put into words as I have on this board from some of the folks who are Christians.
1	Which is why the "medical establishment" endorses smoking, drinking heavily and a fatty diet, with no excercise, because they believe we are predestined by our genes, right? Why do you persist with these blatant lies?	ythe medical establishment has convinced people that we are what we are because what our genes say we are
0	What's a "marriage officer"? If that's like a priest or minister, than certainly they shouldn't have to perform a ceremony that doesn't coincide with their beliefs. But if it's a government position, like a justice of the peace, then they should either leave their religion at home when they go to work, or get a job that doesn't conflict with their beliefs. Religious freedom does not give you the freedom to deny freedom to someone else.	They did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it non-mandatory to some extent:"But it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her "conscience, religion and belief.
0	Criminals continually inform the public that their greatest fear is a victim capable of fighting back against them and possibly killing them.	Criminals, being the lowlife, deviant scum they are, would never be smart enough to anticipate the possibility that their victims might be armed, and would thus never take along guns themselves.
1	jesus christ srom!!! you live in the stone age... i'm surprised you have internet access.	no, i don't watch fox news because i don't have those channels.
0	He's pointing out that the situation is about the mother and the baby, and that the baby's right to life ends exactly where the woman's right to personal autonomy begins. That's the interesting thing about rights-based ethics, that the rights of any individual are limited precisely by the rights of all other individuals.	What are you talking about?
1	Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so "self-confident" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.	If you think he can I am not surprized that you think Mr. Dawkins has superb logic.

0	I think that the bad guys will be happy if any gun control law goes into effect, because then there will be less chance of the victum having a weapon for their defense, and the crime rate will rise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Well I have to say that I beleive if we banned all air guns that violence, murder, carjackings, rapes, and all violent crime would drop.

1	Do you have something-other then words from a dusty old book of myth to offer as an explanation?	Because science continues to LOSE GROUND in its search for explanations for origins of the first life?
0	Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them :)Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.	Monkeys show sense of justice Absolutely amazing.
0	I don't understand this business of the UK and England at all. It seems to me that somebody has a chip on their shoulder. Who cares? Chomsky is not as bad as the terrorists. That's an obvious fact. What is equally obvious is that he provides aid and comfort to the enemy and that's the definition of a traitor.	:)  On the issue of Chomsky, are you saying his writings on American make him as bad as the terrorist who kill and maim People ?

1	I don't know about you..but being shot in the back is more human than being taken apart piece by piece. If I recall correctly, Chinese inmates sentenced to death are executed this way to minimize the pain.

0	Well, thank you for this thread Santafeur. I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff. The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me. In fact, I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about. What difference does it make? We are here now. Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?	what is so fascinating about something you'll never live long enough to witness if it does exist and that you've seen all there is to see of if it doesn't exist?does anyone here really lack in something to validate themselves so much that they have to turn to a bunch of dead animals to find a reason for living?
0	Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.	How can what did not erode for 100 million years to expose a full dino print, now be eroding only within the last 40?
1	Archie, the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says, every accepted definition of the words socialism, statism, capitalism, fascism and nazism. If we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words, it STILL does not work because the argument is STILL illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it.   Face it. You got pwned. Are you really not bright enough to recognize that?	While at the same time, right now, aren't we seeing our own government promoting increased regulations in overseeing the control of these corporations, just as Hitler did in Germany?
0	Sounds pretty neat. I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?	I have been there and felt the chill when I saw what could only be prints of very old humans co-existing with dinosaurs.
1	so you reference shakespeare to explain the song of solomon? seems rather convoluted, but whatever.	you go to the public library and look up the oxford english dictionary--which i explicitly named.
1	Oh, I think you take delight in spelling it out in excruciating detail. Otherwise, you'd reply on point.	I didn't feel that I needed to spell it out in excruciating detail for you.
1	My mistake; I read it wrong. And guess what? I do know what the moon is ;)	I had said "what if" the Moon (You know, that big round object which appears a lot in our night sky.)
0	That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources "until the newborn dies" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.	Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).

Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.	the only stupid gun laws are the laws that arent strict enoughlike the law that gun nuts wanted that would allow children to tote around assault rifleshow stupid can you be
1	since when has religion been pragmatic or based upon systems that works?  Obvious answer: never.	did you read the news report about bush's former friend who taped him regretting his former days of indulgence?
0	well, i'm back from my rejuvenating outing. did i have any epiphanies, you ask?  what, one wonders, could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted, their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived, without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times, and ennoble us in our daily pursuits.	well, my views are probably shaded by my anger of religion, after being under its influence for all of my childhood and a better part of my adult life.

0	Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims. PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.	IM2L844: The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved.
1	Cool I want to be free of the regulation that I wash my hands before preparing other peoples food.

0	religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected. why? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes, unless you are a black gay. it is the way each class is treated that is the same. coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people. the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth.	as explained the last time we crossed paths matthew, there is no evidence presented that would suggest homosexualism is in any way a legitimate aspect of life for differentiating one from another.

1	So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?	It seems clear to me: if you are not sure it's not human, don't kill it.

0	deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said. You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought. In fact, some of the cited refute such claims.	I got no idea what you are talking about.
1	You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican.

0	i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.	the reason we can tell this is that virginia and those other named states do not have higher crime rates than the cities with strict gun laws.
1	You actually have some full insight into gays and what we have gone through and think were pathetic. Once again insults and a bigoted view Archie. You never cease to amaze me.	You may have bought into that image lesz, but I can plainly and clearly see the full extent of the misery index which comes with the homosexual lifestyle.
0	i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?	the point i'm making is the rejection of these doctrines does not make the fundamentalist protestant churches any less christian, nor is the rejection necessarily incorrect, and the same principle applies to reform judaism.
1	Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases.	That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists.
0	With regard to this statement you have to consider:1. How can anyone know what product an "intelligent designer" wanted.2. Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia.But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants.	An intelligent designer would design a system to produce the product as easily as possible.

0	I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.	It's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal.

0	Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to "polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it." Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it.	Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious.
1	to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion.	maybe it could have been a better plan, but what we have now is better than the nothing we've had under mostly republicans.. clinton being the only democrat who also failed to deliver ....
0	Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce "remotely" from Virginia.Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS.	Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely, if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else.
0	i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost.	hard to make people happy when you attack other countries causing you to spend well into debt thus lowering your economy and bringing other economies with it.
1	your daddy plugged your hole?? is that why you are so sour. i guess you ate too many beans recently, and that made you full the holy spirit..	then call the police, or whoever it is you're currently whining to, if you don't like it.
0	and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance? or for credit cards, for that matter? the cost of a policy, or card, is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer. don't want to pay high premiums, take the risk on yourself. period. i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another's morality. we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know.	it is affordable and obtainable for those who do not actually need it, but impossible to get or unaffordable if you can.
0	But my relationship is between a man and woman. You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that. Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman.	OK, are YOU willing to settle for legal recognition of your relationship with your spouse under federal and state laws as a "civil union" only?
1	That sort of warms the cockles of my heart. Namely that some Europeans might be disinclined to visit or stay here. Don't let the door hit you in the buttocks on the way out.

0	See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.	Diseases used to be ascribed to God and it was thought that those people who got sick deserved to be sick because of their lack of piety.
1	I can understand your disappointment. Its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions. No easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim.

WOW, in one fell swoop you completely destroyed my faith in God.
0	When was the last mass murder at a UK university then?	with tens of millions of gun owners, and hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and you think the guns are still the problem....
0	Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.	I thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage.

1	Your "opinion" was a kindergarten question outlining a "problem" that never existed, a "problem" that was explained to you 3 or 4 times.

I just realized it's a waste of time sharing my opinion with you self important XXXXXX who think you have such a grasp on science that you dazzle yourselves into a frenzy.
0	You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean "will", "must", or "shall" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it "CAN" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun.	You should really think about what you say before you say it.

And I'd think the explanation would be that oxygen content was much different before the flood

0	So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's "weak gun control laws" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?It seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to America, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons. They've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there, they can make whatever they need or want.	You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms.

0	an innocent person can be convicted of a crime--i thought that was what the topic was about. just because they are convicted, doesn't mean they are 100% responsible, guilty, etc for that crime-but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system--they are guilty. that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years--they are convicted of a crime. i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics, then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence. okay, everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on--what is it with you people? like i said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.  comprende' ?	are you saying that in the past no one has been wrongly executed when we are now seeing dna and other tech freeing inmantes basically every 2 months?

1	So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is.	Frankly I thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agencies and organizations which they may need to interact with in the future.

Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government.	Right is one thing, but duty?

0	dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views..	if a man can't exercise that self control, to a point where he rapes a woman, then he does deserve jail.
0	Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe.	No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced.

In Plessy the Supreme Court ruled that black men weren't entitled to the same facilities as white men, rather they had to have their own private facilities, separate from those of white men.Forget precedent, the Supreme Court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled.
1	business is a purely private association. you mean like interracial marriage? 'social harm' is just another term for 'things i personally find distasteful'.	i am hopeful that once we get a democrat in the white house, that will change.

0	George Bush won the majority of votes (the first majority winner in 16 years) in an election with the highest turnout in US history (>117Million voters). The Senate Minority Leader was defeated by a nobody. Democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the House and Senate, something that never happens in a Presidential election year. This gave the Republican majority in both branches of Congress even more control. 11 Liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins. If liberalism ISN'T dead, then it's in ICU on a heart and lung machine. emoticonXRolleyes	I would like to point out that it was hardly a land slide.
1	Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:  Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?

1	So you think that ID is actually Christanity?

0	Oh, really? Does that mean that pesticides will be OK on marijuana plants? NO.	* Smoking tobacco is quite unhealthy even without pesticides.
1	And you're baffled that you don't have more intelligent debate with people. I'm shocked.	There is nothing wrong with honest intelligent debate on this issue, but the anti-gun crowd don't bring honest intelligent arguments to the table.
1	oh really, a combination of the words expel and arm mean to expel arms? wow, she was a creative genius! i think what he meant was rowling just takes all the stereotypical magicy stuff and mashes it all together into a tacky and overused paste.	i think expelliarmos means to expel (get rid of) arms (weapons).
1	Did you notice how what I was responding to was said? I didn't think so. Your tunnel vision is showing again.	Its not what you're saying its how you're saying it.
0	what is capitalism? can there be something like 'responsible capitalism' and, if so, what would 'responsible capitalism' be? my view is that the term 'capitalism' has a multitude of meanings dependent upon who is defining it and that 'capitalism' could have a multitude of modifiers to further refine its meaning. is to be a capitalist to be utterly free of responsibility and blame for the evils that capitalism may cause?	if it is, i don't share your sentiments.

0	This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?	I wonder how many of these "great physicists" also believed that night air could make them ill?
0	Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton.	So a piece of stonehas the force of gravity as its own property does not it?
0	but why should i care about their emotions? they obviously don't care about mine. this is in reference to the jonestown massacre, where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink (i don't think it was actually kool-aid) laced with cyanide. okay.	as for the kool-aid: i often see this referenced in arguments between americans, i have no idea what it is.
1	Anyone speaking English could well be an illegal from the UK then, right? I guess Puerto Ricans better watch out too.	It is reasonable to suspect anyone speaking Spanish in Arizona as being an illegal alien.
1	I was eight at the time. I'll read up and get back to you. Mind your manners.	It was these same gun control nuts that chose to intentionally not require private transfers to involve background checks.You missed the opportunity back in 1968, you have no room to gripe about it now.
0	Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.	That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4.
1	So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies.	Why do you talk past me so I feel like I'm eavesdropping on a post intended for someone else?
0	Not quite. To be more correct regarding government and guns, the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence.Our political philosophy is very clear on this:"that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" - Declearation of IndependaceYou have the right to try and revolt with violence. You don't have the right to win a revolt.	One of the biggest arguments against gun control is that if the government became too oppressive, the people wouldn't have the capacity to carry out a successful rebellion.
0	How is that a strawman? Your challenge directly relies upon something you assume to be proven, but has not been. Therefore even in a hypothetical stance, your underlying arguments are invalid, thus leading to everything else being invalid. You're not doing so well on this forum.	And where, pray tell are you pulling THIS strawman from?
1	Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity ).	How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God?
0	i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills.	there are many problems with society depending on which part of society one belongs to.
0	Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick.	This is not true.
1	Why not? My mother has been 39,for the last 39 years.	''No, actually the earth is 150 years old.
0	I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress. It's all politics.	So why, in this gun-hater's dream come true of congress, did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law?
0	Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.	And why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ?

0	are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire.	the size of mortgages is such that even a small rate change will push many over the limit of affordability.

0	Oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? They're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept.	Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring
0	walking-fish: has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10^23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe. what is it about science that you don't understand?	ok ill ask it in a different way has anyone obseved us evolving frmo monkeys?.....

0	Actually, there is no such thing as "an evolutionary mutation of a gene." A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?	An evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed.
0	Mythology. But nevertheless, shipbuilding has been going on for a lot longer than 500 years. There have been a lot of skilled shipbuilders who have passed along their knowledge from generation to generation. Do you think that every time someone builds a ship that they invent the whole process? Nah. 300 ft is about the limit for wood no matter how you design it. Even worse it you cast a big box adrift in a huge storm. How did the animals survive the rolling and rolling?	And you do realize that Noah was about 500 years old when he started the ark.
1	Amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term "light year."   If I am so ignorant, explain how your argument does not require exactly what I said: That God operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young Earth Creationism.   I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar.	The ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums, much less this ONE.

1	Um, Bassman, so you, the one person in the world who is as "pure as the wind-driven snow," is the one who may judge others, including Democrats. Um, for the record I grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of "wind-driven snow" and it was not particularly pure. A feeble and laughable metaphor.	Democrats are not clean and pure as the wind driven snow, they do not have an absolute birthright to govern, and they certainly are not the only ones qualified to govern!
1	btw, jazyjason, before you edited out your complimentary comment about howard dean. just wanted to say i'm surprised you said anything to associate yourself thus with a such an irrational far left commie. must stay with the mudflingers and lynch mobs and, especially if they're jesus lovers, ya know. so ... i understand why you took it down. merry christmas.	although i think it was feingold who said that obama has gotten the bill he intended to, from the beginning.

0	Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).	Would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity, mind, consciousness or existence in actuality?
1	Well, maybe the pistol and the hunting rifle, what do you need an automatic weapon? Have the deer gotten faster?	Now I think it does get a little extreme with owning several M-16s, but if I want to own a pistol, a shotgun, and some fancy automatic, well that's my right.

0	Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person.	My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, fetus, etc., is a Someone.
1	Where did you here this XXXX?Some cheap detective novel or something?Once again, my sincerest apologies.	Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever is left, however improbable, must be the truth.

1	Well, considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are, I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others.	So, when we believe the gospel, the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Christ's body, and our sins are forgiven through His shed blood.
0	Just curious, is it beyond you to make a post that includes common sense and logic? I'm thinking it is since all of you posts seem to be based on rhetoric and emotion. Three paragraphs and all of them contain a falsehood/ lie, congrats your batting 1.000.	Every time I see another story about another shooting in America, sometimes ever two or three shootouts and killings, it absolutely thrills me because I know that the NRA has armed even more Americans and more Americans can now go out and shoot and kill and maim.So, carry on, NRA!
1	Not true. I googled "helpful mutation" and got a nice list of examples. I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions.	The failure to observe even one mutation that adds information is more than just a failure to find support for the theory.
0	Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc...	I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old.
0	But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No.   Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No.	Marriage is to promote children bearing and making a family unit.
0	I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.	Is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax?

0	But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the "discrimination" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ... emoticonXRolleyesAnyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess.	Some Iowa county recorders say they have contemplated refusing to give a marriage license to gay couples who walk into the office, but so far none is vowing to do so.“This is putting us in a very, very difficult position here,” Wayne County Recorder Angela Horton said Thursday in an interview.

0	that explains why your politician can work together i bet your current government is made of a collation ? in the uk parliament we still have a first past the post system where the party with the majority form the government.  it is slightly different in scotland we have a hybrid system of pr and first past the post, the politics in scotland has changed slightly in fact the executive is made up of a collation between two parties. this has the effect of making our politics more consensual where parties can actually discuss and negotiation solutions without party politics and vote scoring.	very representational with a 4% floor concerning the national parliament (that is; you need at least 4% of the votes to be given mandates in the riksdag (national parliament))

0	i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?	i think your question should be 'why did god make commandments?'
0	No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God.	of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard "n" is right next to "b" last time I checked).
0	i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate. as for my personal take, 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that. do you disagree? prejean should not have lied about it. anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy. seeing some of hilton's work, i don't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody. i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about' is exactly why he was chosen.	wow, foundit is apparently quite the staunch anti-indecency advocate.
1	How about not clicking the "reply " button twice (heh,heh,) No, we didn't (Thank goodness) AND! PM Blair is recanting from the Kyoto protocol. Bully for him!	Yes, we've signed it, how about you?How about Iraq for not "respecting national autonomy"?
0	You only say that it won't make a change because you support the effects it will have.	You may have the right to keep and bear arms, that doesn't exempt you from being treated differently on the basis of your choice to do so, anymore than your right to free speech exempts you from being treated differently if you advocate segregation or paedophilia.
0	Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.	It's a good argument for doing away with the death penalty and their expensive trials.
1	Kill or be killed, survival of the fittest? No compassion, the rule of tooth and fang? WOW, color me impressed!	I suspect the correct religion is the one practiced by all non-humans on the planet.
1	So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.	creation is so easy to know.
0	well, signorile certainly didn't back up his opinions in this instance. how do you know it's the truth? if it were definitive, i'd be more inclined to agree. it's not 'common knowledge' that merv griffin was gay, at least not outside of hollywood. i'd never heard it myself. i don't see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were (like having sex with someone of the same gender).  and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 80s is absolutely opinion.	it may have been an opinion piece (as are all blogs), but he indicated he researched these facts for a book he had written.
0	The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc	I'm new to this idea that science has over-ruled Creation.
0	thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression.	so lets see how many other people are being targeted by the inquisition for their faith by the big three.
0	What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent.It's the woman's body that carries the fetus. It ultimately the woman's decision. As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion.	I'm sorry but the baby is a part of both of them.Should it be that the mother decides to keep the baby and the father want's her to terminate the state will still come chasing for child support.Why the father didn't get a say on if the baby was born or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law says so.
1	Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion.	I CAN EMPIRICALLY PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE GOD OF THE BIBLE VIA ITS CENTRAL CLAIMS
0	i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?	from now on, they should just fire all the judges and lawyers and let me decide.
1	Turned?  What do you mean turned?  (Oh man! Got you one more time! Brutal! lol)	guess i'll turn in now....beings that i've done turned nerd...
1	It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?	The laws are strictly enforce although they can still be beaten.
0	Now, now ZSU, we learned from comrade star gazer that GW created the Continental Army. I am sure these gentlemen have some equally illogical and inaccurate 'facts' to scatter around the barnyard emoticonXHoho	Ah the non human part.
0	And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology.	Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins.
0	No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system.	More concrete than the thought processes which dismiss out of hand the flat statement of the US Secretary of State opining that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, but allow them only to be lawfully held by the state?
1	If it isn't so hard then why haven't you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.	“Not that hard to figure out dude...What is your proof?”
0	do we want to have control over ourselves? some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. i dont know much on this matter, im only 14. but, ive been to a conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. its a narrow minded hellhole.	no i mean why not for people.
1	what did i previously tell you, i.e. well hey, moose, you're in a topic which highly relates to the bible. if you want a secular response there's plenty of those guys around. if you want to chat with me i'll usually be coming from a biblical perspective. but i'll be glad to talk with you on a secular subject if you want. what are you looking for? p.s. please hold your 'honest attempts at discussion' rants, ok? i could easily claim the same with you since you are out of god's wisdom. but i won't. what did you want to know? again, what did you want to know?	i say your interactions are not honest because you persist in these diversions, instead of directly answering with ideas that came out of your mind.
1	are you talking about this one??? he was talking about 'god'. he never said your 'god'. and i am both amused and bored by the fact that i just explained to you how evolution and a belief in a creator can co-exist, and you completely ignored it. but you're going to continue to claim that they are mutually exclusive, won't you...	did you not see the post by obvious child that i answered foundit?
1	This is great. You mean none of the Davidic line ever copulated with women to produce their descendents? LOL!	Which of course, , would not have made him the 'seed of david', because the 'seed of david' could only be through the unbroken male line (no women in the mix).
1	B.S. simone. He was the perfect age for Vietnam. Why hasn't he released his draft card? I know, they only sent them to citizens.	It wasn't necessary for President Obama to be in the military when he was coming up but he sure wouldn't have crapped out like George W. Bush and sent someone else to die in his place in Vietnam.
0	And if God was so against killing the unborn, why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn, why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women?I bet you won't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do. See my signature for examples.	He was declaring war on an unclean people whom He commanded the Jews to wipe out in a time of WAR.
0	I got ya, but I still disagree. if free will doesnt exist, then why should I make an effort to do anything? if I am destined to be wealthy, then no matter how lazy I am today, I'll be wealthy sometime down the road. and if Im destined to poor, no amount of hard work and diligence on my part can change that. why wouldnt I just drift along life and allow destiny to take me where I will inevitably end up?	I am sayin that salvation is not a choice.
0	He is a hell of a lot wiser than thee.	Let's just point out, as far as the article is concerned, just how many of your fellow Americans you're talking about.And what they must think about someone like you.
1	You do realize you just disproved your own basic points yes?   The pictures you posted are falsified because abortion clinics and small health clinics contract out to places to have their medical waste incinerated.   Good job on failing to realize you just proved Cunx correct.	Can you imagine the cost for every abortion clinic if they owned their own medical waste incinerator?
1	Actually, I read that the god of the bible was really a macaroni monster. He likes cheese, too.	It doesn't really connect to your comment, the whole Paris Hilton theory spawned from eating a whopper and trying to be a nuisance, both of which were highly successful.
0	john mccain is nothing more than another rino. he is the media's darling from the gop.	even though i am extremely liberal, i kind of liked mccain--until he kissed up to bush after bush and his people crapped all over him in south carolina.
1	You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.	You know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non-sentient life forms victims and referring to martin Luther King Jr. to justify their views.
0	Any belief system is a religion loosely defined. I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?	Your belief that a fetus deserves the same rights as fully developed people does.
0	think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is "wrong" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image	Since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect.
0	"He" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality. For some of us it's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day. But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists, it does nothing to lessen His reality.	No disrespect intended in that I agree with you in that "he" is real to you, just as Santa is to children whose parents told them there is a REAL Santa.
0	No, not really. All that is different is the number of steps.  What is YOUR definition of 'macro-evoution'? Is it speciation? Or is it a brand new genus?  We have observed speciation, where new species happened.	It may be perfectly legitimate to make these inferences, but the point of the statement from wikipedia  was that micro-evolution is directly and (more importantly) currently observable.
1	And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?	And when you're high, you're too ignorant and doped up to know that it's the marijuana that's making you act like a XXXXX.
1	I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?	I will not alter my foundational belief in marriage and family just because some cry for freedom at all costs.
0	Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems.	The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.
0	So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.	It turns out, the Johns Hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life.
0	First of all, it's not a precedent. this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional. Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called "lawlessness". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some "agenda" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us.	People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws.
1	That's nice, but have you ever thought of reading your own religion's Holy Book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that Jesus and his disciples said?	in Philly so I know my catechism...That is what is important to me..........
1	As usual, you shoot from the lip. I have no illusion of perfection, However I am convinced that as long as you live I will never be the dumbest man on earth.	I am sorry the only perfect man that ever lived was Jesus Christ and maybe you in your own mind
0	is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers.	no doubt that people who are determined to be anti-bush will always try and find something wrong with it, but i think bush's speech last night was very good.
1	What prompted this?  I guess I need to check what website I'm in...  Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. But, I've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.  But, carry on, Orion. You've shown your true colors now. Cluck at will... emoticonXChicken emoticonXRolleyes	you'll pardon me, please, if i view your response as that of an idiot or dolt.
0	So we should just say "god did it", and give up?	The fact is foundit, that creationists and I-Ders understand that there are so many unanswerable questions, so we know we can't answer them for certain, because Man just doesn't have the knowledge to discern the truth from the minutia.
1	Has the American Medical Association decided to recognize that aluminum, steel and polymer and addictive narcotic substances that can drastically alter a person's mental status?	What about a firearm junkie?
1	Primarily from your side of the aisle in all arguments. You really described yourself a T.	Sinjin, have you ever considered the problem of murky, misinformed, not to mention willfully ignorant, understanding?It seems to be something that one encounters a lot in these here precincts.
0	because it shows that your data is not absolute, and that there is supporting evidence for both sides? it also stops you justifiably saying things like... the data speaks for itself. in america, guns save more lives than are taken by them. fact. did you know that in the uk, i am statistically at least twice less likely to be killed than you? fact. it works both ways...	ha...what is the point of posting data if you are just going to conclude there isn't enough data?
1	you're kidding. just because your life is 'a fricken breeze' that doesn't mean the other 7 billion people on this earth have a breezy life. have you even watched the news lately? it's either that, or you live on another planet.	i don't know what people are complaining about.
0	Very true, especially since when someone asks "is there a God" they are most likely really asking "does the God in which I believe exist"	they could just as well not be there, and life as we know it would be the same.
1	3101 posts! what a waste of cyber real estate! at least you are brief.	Al Bore is nothing but a political opportunist to the Nth degree.
1	honestly did not know that acorn was such an evil organization that was based on evil-ness.  but really acorn seems like a very good organization based on helping those in need of help. i was under the impression of something totally different. i guess don't believe what you hear on fox news =]	http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/10/did_obama_lie_about_ayers.html  as for acorn... yeah, these guys look like real sons of bitches... everyone knows trying to help the poor makes you a radical commie.
0	And if the "natural process of evolution" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked?	So, when Miller says "I believe in Darwin's God", he is saying that God sustains the natural process of evolution and an intermediate agent.
1	You mean you don't think you have your own made-up religion?? How interesting! Do you really think you're fooling God? Or us?? Or even yourself??	Do you really think you're fooling God?
1	Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.	It's unparsimonious.You don't need absolute proof for something to be valid.
0	oh yes, the rhubarb is one of my favorites too. a fine choice..you get a cake emoticonxbirthdaycake	oh my how i love pie.
1	there is no problem in what you 'believe' in. science is irrelevant in many beliefs. just sole belief in a deity and his disciples, is what many religions revolve around. but, i am astounded by your god's name, no harsh feelings. a dragon lord king is quite a mouth full don't you say? can we just call em, greeble. :)	now, let us pray to the one true creator of the universe king greeble the dragon lord.
1	Now, that logic is so bad, it's worse than circular reasoning. It's figure eight reasoning.	God IS GOOD all the time and in the end God will win meaning creation beats evolution every time.
1	I guess the European union is a great failure? Is that why the Euro is trending 1.5 dollars as liberalism creats misery?	The idea is that Conservatism works every time it is properly implemented.
1	have you considered a career in advertising?  by the way you f***ed us too. Australians troops were cannon fodder in WWI for the British Empire, remember Gallipoli?	we gave you 'f*ck' too, but do you really think that 'australia: so what the f*cking hell are you waiting for' would be an appropriate ad campaign just because we started the word?
1	No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is "pro-evolution". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's "faith-based" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach	As for who plays 'word-games', it seems that you missed this... #19 "New peppered moth stuff"He went on for some time trying to undermine my posts based on the use of a word which most people have a problem with.There's also the problem with Darwin claiming a tautology was a better term than "Natural Selection", this was debated for some time, even though I posted the actual words of Darwin.The thread "Unto the Ages of Ages" developed into a debate over whether something could be both ''more accurate' and wrong, thanks Ursus!WJA and SLP argued over the word 'applied', then 'published'; whether Dembski had, and then changed this to 'proved' (see "Looking for intelligence" thread)Lurch/Ungerdunn etc over what is a 'noun'.
1	Hey, someone has to clean our toilets. This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education.	Families that embrace ID/Creationism are increasingly deciding that their children have no place in the "classroom".
1	are you completely incapable of making sense? penfold used deliberately obtuse language. this language was then explained to you. now you are arguing that 'turn the other cheek' is completely different, and in no way similar, to 'revolve/rotate' the other cheek. if you turn something, you revolve or rotate it. you're so busy being affronted by what people say that you come off as even more simple than they try to make you appear.	but for anyone to actually argue that penfold used clearly descriptive language in getting his point across, proves that you all are either too ignorant to know any better, or you're just taking this stance in order to stand against me.
1	And, let's see, when did the job loss actually start?   Oh yes.. We can trace the troubles starting in 2007, with a big melt down in August/September of 2008. Let's see.. Obama must have been a terrible president to have caused that.. oh WAIT. That wasn't Obama, that was BUSH.. Excuse Me.	It's the loss of non-government jobs that people don't like.
0	So was I. I did say I was playing devil's advocate. As far as I'm concerned, Tiktaalik is a triumph of scientific deduction.	I just was impressed that the fossil was not found by happenstance.
0	I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed. an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human. this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.	my opinion, their banning a gun because of the way it looks they seem to think an ak47 is worse than a regular gun because it looks like a military gun the only true (assault weapon) is fully automatic i have.
1	Did you even read ythe OP? Did you even read the title?   Pointless distinction? Huh.   I understand what you are saying. I also know you are changing your argument. When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it.	Either that or you're pretending to not get it.
1	And you wonder why people call "republicans" racist, women hating bigots. (hint: it's comments like yours)	The only reason Obama is even in office is because blacks are voting for a black man and free stuff, Hispanics want no borders, and most women don't know or don't care how bad the Obama liberals are digging America into the ground financially.
0	That's certainly your right, but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda, not a scientific one. He may want it disguised as a scientific one, but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire.	I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.
0	Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'.	It can certainly be a false theory, however, you can rationally show that it is or is not (to the degree determined by your evidence).
0	it is no "story"........i am debating on the whole evolution thing... look at the facts. so many great ppl, physics people, niels bohr, he was for evoulution, then he found out all of the facts that it is junk, so he became a christian	Is this a debate over the accuracy of the Genesis creation story or just a debate over the general idea that God did in fact create the world and it's inhabitants?
1	Hmm maybe I should take that one to a local patent office...	Glory holes in public conveniences is a gay invention not mine.
1	And, I'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker, right?	I would just want the woman to ask that question before she spreads her legs.Dono
1	So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws).   But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal.	How can you think that a baby that isn't born yet a nonentity?yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what "abortionist's" say is a load of ****!!
1	Is it not extremely cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not suffer from hypothermia due to the extreme cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not fall from the sky and break near all his bones when the wheel well opened for landing after a lengthy flight at 35,000 feet? Do I have to give you the flight number and type of airplane in order to get my stuffed animal circus prize?	For example, when and why did he die of hypothermia?
0	I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are.	They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) ...
0	How do you know carbon dating is so accurate? Would you bet your life on it?	Carbon dating is only accurate up to a point, and that point is WELL beyond creationism's statements.
1	Does this mean that you have finally repented of your multiple divorces??	[B]Let it not be said the grace of God for salvation in Jesus Christ is not freely available.
1	Another red herring gay argument. Ever hear of a medical power of attorney? You don't need marriage to have one, you know. emoticonXRolleyes	It's amazing that someone would list making medical decisions for a loved one who is unable to as a benefit.
1	Ahh, pointy tailed devils with pitchforks, more of your menagerie of divvels, demons, saints, angels, demigods, ghosts and other varied superstitious nonsense. Which of your gods created them, Snerdley?	That serpent, the devil, has been having his way with you for some time now.
1	Come on down to skid row with the rest of us 'lower class' I'll even buy a bottle of MD 20/20 on me.	Alas, I can no longer drink any sort of alcoholic beverage, although I used to love to drink the excellent foreign beers, high grade gin, scotch, brandy etc., in other words, sipping whiskey as opposed to the cheap raw stuff that the lower classes guzzle up.
1	oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.	Don't know about anyone else, but I don't think you have that much impact on our lives SS Who's more arrogant?
0	I know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but I think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has, what post number this is, how many are left, any comments concerning going outside the rules, etc.	Once the debate has begun, I will not make another post until the end.One week sounds reasonable - you might want to post within a shorter gap later on, but that will be up to the person posting.
0	What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking.	That's my claim
0	What possible concern is any of that to you?    Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon.	Do you believe that you will hear an understanding of God that you've not heard before, or are you of the belief you are open-minded on the subject, and might well have an epiphany?
1	Simone, read the sentence again please. It was "Saving lives is "not just" a Republican goal." It concerns the subject of abortion.   The only way it relates to the politics of Iraq, is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to "volunteer" their services for Iraq.   I can't let one statement you made go though. Terrorist continue to terrorize us? Where have they attacked in the U.S. since 9-11? Consider continuing this in an appropriate thread.	Saving lives is a Republican goal?Then, why have the Republicans condemned us to this ugly, nonproductive war in Iraq?The terrorists continue to terrorize us because we have deterred our efforts against them to Iraq, (and Bush intends to widen this nonproductive war into Iran and Syria) where nearly 700,000 Iraqis have been needlessly slaughtered, where more than 3,000 of our young have been sacrified in vain, and you have the audacity to say that "saving lives is a Republican goal.
