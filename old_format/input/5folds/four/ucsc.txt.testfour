1	i love how the government has become the scapegoat for the failure of parents to control their kids, and in turn we are losing more and more civil liberties...	its not the governments job to censor information.  for kids being subjected to things on the internet shouldnt be the governments right to have them see certain things and not see others. thats what parents are for.
0	Do you have any evidence for that? And still, I don't know what you mean by kind.	God created all things in "Kinds" - a supergiant group.
1	why thank you , and yes i guessed that as you are pretty busy grovelling to the hide and seek champ , so full credit to you and of course the invisible dictator ..., don be shy take a bow .....	wow, that is so original. i know most of us christians have never heard a retort like that. bravo!
1	you and omegawatsit are the we? or are you the same person? whatever, i'm glad for you. keep up the study and you might achieve the dizzy heights of the mid thirties by next year!	i'll answer your off-topic aggression with more off-topic aggression.  'we' are the people with iqs above 21. :)
0	So much for your cover. Its blown. You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons. Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil. Maybe you will never know - in this life at least :(	well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.
1	how are you proving that when you have gone out of your way to ignore your failures?  tell me, does comic book art prove creationism? does tv props prove creationism? is oil a hydrocarbon? is density sorting in a fluid medium 'ludicrous?' does a theory that requires miracles work on a scientific level?  how is 'why' the same as 'what?' and since when does grammar depend on the person saying it rather than the statement being said? you claimed that taz did not screw up the grammar, yet i did. yet the statements were identical. how are you addressing what i said when you've completely ignored everything i listed?  more yelling. no actual argument.  the whole point of that was to show you make large numbers of asinine statements. do you reject that?  red bold statements don't make a winning argument.	i'm addressing exactly what you said. you have said this on numerous occasions!!! it's time to prove it, now!!! so i repeat once again!!!   stop changing the subject and prove your claim if you aren't lying!!! link to the post's of me saying that bees can't fly. tq tried it and has been proven to be a liar also, so show your claim in context of the debate you are claiming i made it in. or admit that you lie like this on a regular basis and distort my arguments in order to claim some sick victory which you never earn honestly but by doing what i am proving here that you have done by claiming that i ever said that bees can't fly! now quote me saying it or admit you're a liar!

0	Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods.	"(25.) I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature."
1	In my case, it isn't 'god fearing'.. so much as "believer fearing'	And what exactly is a "God-fearing athiest" anyway?
1	Ah yes resort to attack when you have no case - perfect example. Its a marvellous demonstration of projection.	And you tq, are a self-righteous, sanctimonious prat who has never contributed one single piece of worthwhile information to any thread, nor one single intellectually interesting thread to this forum, in the entire time you've been posting here. You are nothing but hayseed busy-body who revels in the belief that you have some sort divine, 'holier than thou', right to stick your nose into other people's business. That priggish behaviour doesn't hide the fact that intellectually you, personally, are a total loser.
1	Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about.	Then they do things like lobby Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF according to Bob Ricker, a former lawyer of the NRA who turned against the organization.
0	And why would I be anti Christianity when I am Christian?   Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I don't believe in Jesus, or something to that extent, I never said anything to that extent, you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it. I believe in the teachings of Jesus. Yes I'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible, My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times. So she's told me all about it, and what its supposed to teach us.	Anyone who finds themselves foolish enough to believe Hitler was a Christian, for whatever reason you want to believe, needs to look up the word 'propaganda.' A lot of you anti-Christians are good at spreading it, though.
1	Actually, I don't sneer at you. I laugh at you. And I don't attack your intelligence but your knowledge. You are intentionally ignorant.	They sneer down at anyone like me who doesn't agree with them. Instead of debating the facts, evolutionists will often resort to attacking the intelligence (or lack of it) in their opponent.

0	why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different.	ooo, you had your gut cut open??  what a pity. i think you could have avoided alot of suffering if you had just used a condom. if you don't want another mouth to feed then just take birth control or use a condom.  why shouldn't fetuses have rights? once they're a fetus, then eliminating them is technically killing them. and at nine months, they're no longer dependent on it's mother's blood, and therefore is technically a baby. at nine months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby.
0	i'm a little surprised- i've found that pot smokers are usually the least pushy. usually they're laid back enough to just offer, unless they forget to offer. i've only ever been pressured to drink by one person, and that's all the peer pressure i've received. i'm not sure if it's the people i hang with, who almost all use something but are very laid back, or if it's that i'd be hard to ressure so that people don't try. what's your experience been?	holy shit :( that's why i never take stuff from people i barely know. i know a guy who got tricked into smoking crack.  i successfully quit smoking, and hope to re-kick my caffeine habit. weed was by far the hardest for me to quit, since it kind of immerses you in the subculture. you end up having to cut people off from your life, because peer pressure really isn't a myth. in fact, weed is the only drug people ever try to insist i use. i guess it's because it's perceived as harmless.
0	that is not true. a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural. an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal. the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed, just that they defy physical law. the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven	That's a stretch you don't need to make though.Not even considering the fact that the bible contradicts itself..i.e. god performs miracles, speaks to people, etc... .. it's the definition that god is supernatural that in itself, cannot be reconciled with god "appearing". The same goes for any diety, or imaginary thing, if by definition they are imaginary/supernatural. Once you "find" something supernatural, they are no longer imaginary or supernatural, thus, you can never find them, they can only exist, by definition, without evidence, with faith. It's relativity in action yet again :)The contradiction you illustrate stands apart from the bible.-Mach
0	You know, this little phrase, "minutes before birth," keeps popping up in reference to abortion.Could someone please explain to me the point of having an abortion "minutes before birth"? What is the point?How many, if any, of this sort of abortion is performed?Could I get a really honest answer to that? Please, no lies.How many?Can anyone tell me?	. . . .The irony is that we all fall somewhere on the line of pregnancy from no abortions at all to minutes before birth. . . .
1	go out there and find all kinds of democrat-led, black-led, white-led, mexican-led, etc.. efforts to protect gay rights. just because you can't find them doesn't mean they're against them. saying all republicans are against gay rights because one of them is, is bigoted, stereotypical and childish. quite moronic too. is it also your claim that all blacks are prejudiced because they haven't formed the naawp yet? grow up.	yeah, why don't you show just how bigoted and stereotyped this thread is? go out there, find all sorts of cases of gop-led efforts to protect gay rights and rub our faces in it!!! go on!!! should be a piece of cake, no?
1	WHAT??? Jito, are you saying that motherhood is difficult? emoticonXWow Now that's a shock...	I would like to point out that very few moms agive birth and then sit around eating bon-bons. Raising kids, doing laundry, running errands, doctors, PTAs, sports, cleaning, etc. And that is just at home. A great many of them work at a job, too - and pay money to support their kids, too - and some don't even get child support. Mine's ten and we haven't seen one thin dime.
0	So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life. Care to give any examples, or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever?	It is our contention that it's the pro-death advocates who misrepresent the facts in order to justify their infanticidal proclivities and justifications as they release women of all personal responsibility and expect the innocent child to be sacrificed at the alter of their immoral lifestyle so they can continue to act irresponsibly.
0	...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers.	i do believe that the predictions are accurate, but i say 'no' for two reasons: one, stopping the event would create a paradox. since the event is stopped, it never happens. if it never happened, then nostradamus never predicted it. the second reason is, in the prediction that correlated to 9-11, skeptics asked why they couldn't stop the incendent. along with point one, i say to them 'how do you know that somebody didn't go to authorities on 9-10-01, and say 'there's gonna be a terrorist attack tomorrow''? if someone cited a cryptic writing dating back centuries as evidence, they would either be laughed at and dismissed, or sent to a mental hospital. edit: sorry about forgetting the poll. i remembered that just as i hit the submit button. i'm half asleep today.

0	considering the dumbocrats have held the house (which initiates spending bills) for most of that time, then you have nothing but more hot air. oh yes he does. he'll let them get the bomb, knowing they want to wipe out israel. not very bright of him. is he an anti-semite?	so every republican president for the last 30 years has been a rino...and every republican congressman?  the fact is that government has expanded faster under republican administrations than democratic ones for almost 50 years now, easy.  this shows that, like so many other things, you are completely ignorant of ron pauls position on iran. he does not advocating 'appeasing' iran. see, like out founding fathers, paul believes that if they dont threaten our national security, it has nothing to do with us and we should leave them alone. that costs us nothing. running around the world fighting pre-emptive wars that bankrupt us against opponents who posed no danger to us is not a viable long term strategy.
0	i have heard that you can easily find a marriage license copy online and without having to pay a fee. is this true? i would love to get a copy of my deceased parents' marriage license if i can. it would be a nice thing to frame and to keep on the wall to remember them by. so, can you find copies of marriage licenses online or is this just an urban myth?	interracial couple denied marriage license in la. - yahoo! news
1	I could have labeled my post "TRAP" and you wouldn't notice. Tell me, are these two contradictory:	Because it is unjust.That is my ideal. I don't want anyone to have to suffer injustice, however if one group is going to pass laws they need to make sure they are subject to those laws.Everyone can commit murder and be subjected to murder laws. Only women have abortions so to have men decide what happens is unjust.
1	That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod.	18 fun challenges for evolutionistsCarl Sagan, the modern-day evolutionary spokesperson has admitted: "The information content of a simple cell has been established as around 1012 bits, comparable to about a hundred million pages of the Encyclopaedia Britannica."
1	But rather than be honest about your mistake, you just changed things without paying any attention to the fact that we've shown you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to the claims of the scientific community.. at least, not until somebody tells you. (And you accuse me of not having a teacher's mentality as I educate you in something you didn't previously know... How pathetic.)	By what standard of evidence does evolution science claim a direct evolutionary relationship with those hominids that preceded us such as Java, Peking and Neanderthal MAN, Is it based on chromosomal, amino acids, cytochrome c, genetics, DNA, lifestyle, or simply based on their hominid/primate similarities? Now if you come back with evidence that Neanderthal buried their dead, and deduce from that a direct relationship with modern man, then surely some chemical relationship has also been discovered since the advent of DNA technology, whether it it nuclear or mitochondrial similarities/connections, or one of the other chemical relationships mentioned above.
1	i love how what you 'personally' feel is in direct conflict with acedemic studies. science says force = mass times acceleration, but i personally feel that force = velocity times volume, so that must be the right answer.	i 'personally' feel that sex ed encourages having sex, and not abstinence. they should be taught just the basics, and children if they are interested can talk about it with their parents or older friends. abstinence is not being encouraged, rather shunned. maybe i'm just old fashioned, and 16 at the same time
1	Is your thinking really this simplistic? Either I have to agree with you or I am an anarchist? Is that all the complexity you can handle? This or that? Black or white? The best soda in the world is Sprite and everything else is wrong? What a boring little pigeon-holed world you live in.  No harm no foul - that is where I stand on sex and romance. Kids, animals and those who don't or can't consent are off-limits. K? Now that I have established (AGAIN) how I feel on that matter, let me reinstate.  Any God that allows love and intimacy for only a select group is viscious.	so you'd rather have a god that doesn't have any standards whatsoever on sex and relationships, to the point where anything-goes? a god of anarchy is not one i'd want to have anything to do with.
1	I suspected as much, well part of my job then is to ignore and make snide comments to people who don't come to debate :)	I don't come here to debate, I come here to make fun of frauds like you.
1	Sorry, I was busy looking at your Base21 source, the one where you post your own article. I figured someone had made up an article on it.   Hey, according to PNC=WW3, if I don't like the people who put the information into the State Dept. website, I don't have to believe it. That's according to him.	You accuse "liberals" of spin?The first site that listed NK as being a state sponsor of terrorism was given to you in post #31 right after you asked for specific evidence to counter each point, AND AGAIN IN POSTS #37 AND #42, in which I actually copied and pasted the entire article.Further to that, is it my fault you were incapable of finding the info posted in the "second horses mouth" link when it was right under your nose in the first State Dept. link?Obviously, we're seeing what kind of a man you really are BITM. emoticonXRolleyes Waxy
0	The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough.	the child in the womb feels pain..when you put the needle up there to try to give the child anestesia in the womb, the child moves away to not get stuck by the needle. Its because it feels pain.. this is after 18 weeks.this is a child in the womb..
1	This is a laughable oversimplication of reproduction. Humans don't make copies. Do you reproduce asexually? I know I don't.	nothing new can be created by making copies, i've addressed this many times
0	The laws of physics are short, descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way. Many times the "laws of physics" have been amended by further information, causing the law to be restated.Actually, I think he meant the way that we have observed the universe and all of nature to operate.	Explain what you mean by the laws of physics. :)
0	But if the repeated tests just confirm the same errors or misinterpretations of the results, all of the independent reviews in the World wont make a difference.	that can then be repeated and that can withstand independent review.
1	No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is.	And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is.
0	Actually, the majority of my first post in this thread came from Robert H. Churchill's article who is an advocate of the individual rights interpretation.	More to the point. They are gun haters. They have an agenda, and that agenda is to persecute, I mean rewrite history about the 2nd Amendment.
0	I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.	What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates.
1	yes, that is certainly going to stop you from a gunman. 'dear god.... please save this soul'	i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some. if your a hunter and you want to kill a deer, then go and by a rifle, but do you really need an ak-47 to kill a little deer? and if your buying a gun for protection, then that is just stupid. there are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for protection. get a guard dog, buy an alarm, or move near a place with a lower crime rate. you could also buy a taser or pepper spray.
0	Well that explains your anger.:p I hope you are blessed with homeliness.:) Makes your commitment easier to keep. How old are you now?	Well, there is no way I'd ever need an abortion, except for rape. I decided at 10 to live a life of celibacy because so much human suffering is related to desires of the flesh.
1	Are you like a Chinese government official or something? Oh wait. I forgot, the Chinese government controls what you say anyway, so I guess it matters not.	Jesus was such a Great liar of the world !
0	You realise I'm talking about if the burglar is running away, not the householder, right? Looking at it again I realise I may not have phrased it clearly enough. I'm saying that some of those "violent" crimes may simply have been burglars pegging it when disturbed.	No worries mate. Brooklyn's 81st Precinct probed by NYPD for fudging stats; felonies allegedly marked as misdemeanorsNew York cops 'fudge' stats like the Tories to make their "strict gun laws" look more compatible to the States that do not have draconian anti gun laws and need not depend on the cops protecting you when they have no duty to do so.I have been following UK stats for a long time and no matter who is in power, the crime rates increase. Often the perp is set free and the victem is the one punished like the incident you mentioned: Pushing someone out the way while attempting to escape is a violent crime under UK law.
1	And that would make you the one that IS advocating the murder of our future generation.	Well, you ARE the one advocating the murder of physicians.
0	quiet the opposite. fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back. molecular biology, geology, radiography do so as well. where do you get the idea that there is no evidence? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us. shoulder's of giants, hun. it is observed. you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype. remember, most mutations are innocuous. not so. only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms (bacteria) situations the 'chances' are very much in favour of it happening. remember, mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random.	yet it is a conculsion derived without evidence. it is only based on what is seen in an instant, not what is seen through time. you just proved my point that there is a preconcieved notion. it has been taught to you. (at least, i seriously doubt you have gone out and observed something evolving first-hand). constant mutation in every generation is not something observed. it still would not account for the extreme specificity of nylon. again, the chances of- a random mutation allowing multiple (i assume there was more than 1 survivor) organisms to digest a synthetic material that happens to be dumped where they are- are very much against it
1	Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental, nebulas natural selection, or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric.	People could have been created accidentally by the magical tree of wisdom as well, or the pink bunny wabbit from mars and then shipped to Earth via 1 way teleportation devices. There's no need for some omnipotent (impossible) God.
1	Your definition of "Godly wisdom" is agreeing with your political positions and your spurious theological justifications for them, so it's hardly surprising you don't encounter any liberals who you think have "Godly wisdom"	If anyone thinks liberals are overly intelligent compared to conservatives just look at California and New York, and that elitist turkey in the White House, who's bankrupting the country.There are undoubtedly many intelligent liberals, but the ones I've seen are a full quart low on Godly wisdom. Intelligence and Godly wisdom are not the same thing.
0	When is wealth redistributed on a whim? The NHS is one of the few good things to come out of WWII and is the mark of a fair society (if you ask me). Restricting health-care according to wealth is despotic....	It is a nanny state where wealth is redistributed on a whim, socialized medicine, socialized school system. It's pretty obvious.
0	So who's the head honcho?   It's not like all these professional scientists all see eye to eye. There are even scientists that hold to theistic evolution.	Professional scientists? Science educators?
1	And you're mentally disturbed. Didn't I say that there is no such thing as a "ex-gay"??? Did I stutter?You can pretend that denial is a river over in Egypt. Somebody thinking that they can successfully "supress" their true orientation, and deny themselves homosexual contact, is delusional..because the truth will always come out..because that's what the truth does. Show me an ex-gay, and I'll show you a liar. Where are they, that I can query them? I'll wait.	It's just a term for someone who has decided to live in a way that isn't gay. They may be "gay" physiologically (whatever that means in terms of biology), but they are living in a way that doesn't give in to that--which is what matters from their religious standpoint. Many people live against urges (regarding various issues) all the time. Ironically, gay pride has itself largely to blame for the 'ex-gay' movement. I think it's an example of some gays swinging back against the 'out-and-proud' far left shift--religious gays are, in effect, saying they don't have to abide by your prescription for their lives.
1	Actually that was obvious based on your type of irrational reasoning.	I am a dirty little democratic liberal for those that care.
1	Then you should be able to post some numbers that show I am wrong. I had absolutely no problem whatsoever finding and posting numbers that show I am wrong.Whipping? Are you on crack, easy? You and your buddy have been completely smacked down here. You have spewed a bunch of rhetoric and BS and been repeatedly shut down with hard FACT.Why dont you go get a high school diploma so you can at least understand basic math...heck...for that matter, a grade school diploma would ensure you had all the math skills to understand how silly your position is in the face of the facts.	HUSSEIN Obama. You both lie like dogs and can't stand up to the truth. Truth and I have busted your chops at every turn. With the whipping you've been taking I'm surprised you even show up around here anymore. You know how to make liberals furious? You tell them the truth. Then watch their heads spin. You might want to go get a college degree and educate yourself so you can run with the big dogs.

1	If the rejecting of the "lifestyle" results in death, beatings, job displacement, eviction, insults or inequality, then what would YOU call it? "Religious moral code?"	It is no shock that if you have a religious moral code that rejects a lifestyle then you would then reject that lifestyle. What is shocking is that one would take the idea of rejecting a lifestyle and declaring it "homophobia" or "gay-bashing". It is a great example of taking a fact and drawing unreasonable conclusions from that. But no one would make such a crazy claim on these forums emoticonXRolleyes

0	Sorry to inform you, but until you are 18 years old in this country, you are not granted full protection of your rights under the constitution of the united states. I don't agree with testing either, but saying that it violates your rights is not a valid argument.	Now, to get on topic, I believe a students rights are breached, without question when random or school wide drug testing is performed.
0	You/he could just have said 'slippery slope' in the first place; that argument is an old one, which I though was dealt with a long time ago. You can't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will, secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A. You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance.	And you just sound ignorant. You wouldn't make this statement if you knew about how Britain's current gun control laws came into existence.

1	Do you have any New Testament passages to back these up - or were you just interested in having a rant?	Civil rights have nothing to do with the religion. If they were based on what the Bible allowed, women would only be looked at as child-bearing, housekeeping, subservient wives. Slavery would be allowed and Girls would get married after having their first period. It's one thing to live in accordance with your beliefs, it's something entirely different to make others live by your rules.
0	Really? I suspect that you have been duped by creationist ministers. There is no hype about Miller/Urey. It was an interesting experiment that demonstrated possibilities.

I lived in George Wa. and the population was less than 2000,it was also just off I-90 and we had plenty of crime from people passing through not   necessarily from people who lived there.	what's this to do with guns?
0	In what universe is there a right to murder?Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.What certain activities are forbidden in public?Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.	In a way, taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it. For instance, we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights. Here are just a small number that come to mind:1) Right to murder2) Right to own slaves3) Right to rape4) Right to abusing children5) Right to vote6) Right to smoke (if you're under 18)7) Right to drink (18th Amendment)8) Right to engage in certain activities in public9) Right to drive as fast as one wants10) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest riverThe list goes on really. The fact is that you don't object to taking rights away in principle, you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain. That is quite inconsistent.Where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway?
1	Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the "right" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say "All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages". Since we have "a government for the people by the people", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people. You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else.	It has to do with freedom and equality but then again I do not expect non empathic people to understand that. Looking at you answers below I would have though you would understand the concept that I get to choose who I share my life with, who I transfer my property too and who I call family. You do not understand that the government says to everyone who is a family by the issuance of that piece of legal paper. The in equality part comes in when I am told that I can not have that piece of paper but some hetero can because someone else has a religious belief that should have no effect on my life what so ever. I am saying that if so religious XXXXX wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then I want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief. If the religious XXXXXX stay out of my life then I will stay out of theirs but if they want to get involved in my life then I want to get involved in theirs. EYE FOR AN EYE equality by its very definition. You want the government out of your life and I want religion out of my government and my life.

1	really? is the aaas a non-scientific organization too? hope you don't read the journal science because it isn't good enough for you.  you just choose to attack the source because it disagrees with your viewpoint. don't let science get in the way of your fanatic beliefs. emoticonxgood  if it isn't a peer-reviewed journal than why does it have to be reviewed by two experts in the field? why is the journal associated with the aaas? why do you attack the source and not offer one that supports your view? is it because you can't provide evidence for any claim you make or because you enjoy the taste of sand? keep digging that hole dane.	if you had quoted a scientific journal then it would be different. as i showed, it is not a scientific, peer-reviewed journal, but rather a membership journal you pay for publishing in, ie. a 'vanity journal.' so you are again lying. emoticonxwow how can you lie that much?

0	Which, we suppose, in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever, right?Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs.Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?	funny that all proponents of abortion for unwanted pregnancies talk about abortion as if being a political statement: I control my body.Funny that they never think that the reason most women need an abortion was because they couldn't control their legs and kept them crossed.They can not control their lust, so much for body control. emoticonXRolleyes
0	Because Africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. There are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. Their food sources are different, their territories are different. The more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. Pretty straightforward, really.	We weren't competing with chimps? Oh really? Doesn't evo claim that the first humans and hominids appeared in Africa? And isn't the dark Continent also the natural and original ecosystem where the Great Apes are from? So how do you claim we never competed if evo is true?

1	That's it? That was your post? To attack a source without anything backing you up? Bravo!	"Hi it's me" wrote:"Dr. Phillip Johnson has been called 'our age's clearest thinker on evolution' and the 'principal lay critic of Darwinism.' He is the author of Darwin on Trial, Reason in the Balance, Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds, and Objections Sustained."He was obviously called that by fellow creationists. I also note that he wrote plenty of books. I didn't realize that there was that much to cover. How much can you write about a topic you don't understand or try to misinterpret?Walking-fish:I love it when creationists/IDers quote Phillip Johnson, but I hate the fact that he has my first name. Lawyers make excellent sophists, being able to support both sides of an argument with equal effectiveness. They can expound forever about topics they are totally ignorant about. And this is what makes Mr Johnson such a valuable resource for the creationist movement.

Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful?	You realized you just bolded a statement saying that science had nothing to do with "them" accepting evolution (a "material explaination") right? ROFL, that my friend was terrible science on your part.
0	Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.	we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*.
0	Well i know it wouldn't be sensible for anyone to call my child an it that is just disrespectfull to both your partener and child.	I've never understood this need to call babies he or she, rather than "it". I refered to my own daughter using "it" for the first month after she was born. It was only because my own mother objected to me doing so that I stopped. Babies look like babies, not like boys or girls. It makes sense to refer to them as "it". It also saves strangers getting embarrased when they guess the gender wrongly. Refer to babies as "it": it isn't disrespectful and it's sensible.
1	Does your use of the past tense "was" imply that you've seen a burning bush and been converted to reality? Or are you still an "anti-american pinko commie bleeding heart liberal?"

0	And what is the full quote? Was it talking about, lets say for example, tutles, where over 90 percent of them die before reaching adulthood?In many species, that is true. The 'rule of thumb' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood, the more offspring that species has.	Here's a quote from mayr regarding selection,"Only relatively few individuals in a given generation would qaulify and survive the selection procedure. That small sample would be able to preserve only a small amount of the whole variance of the parental population. Such survival selection would be highly restrained." What Evolution Is. pg. 118So....do you evolutionists agree with this? Let's take humans. Are only a few people in this generation "fit" enough to go on to breed? Is Mayr smoking crack or what?????? This theory is pathetic.
0	Since evolution is a non-theistic theory (it does not consider if there is a god or not), you will have to look at some like http://www.theistic-evolution.com/I would also look up Kenneth MIller on the web... a highly Christian biologist who defends evolution.	This is a good site, but very atheist I think. Do you know of a good theistic equivalent? I do not mean like those awful websites that misrepresent science to try and shoehorn the world into their Bible stories (sorry to pick on Christians here, but it is Christian ones that I notice), but ones that look at real science and look to see if a theistic explaination works for things?
0	Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.	I agree. These laws limiting magazine capacity are based on stupid assumptions that are based on Hollywood (think drive by Hollywood). The average shooting involves less than 5 rounds fired. So limiting the capacity has no affect on crime.
1	I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation. PS...from "our" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain.	Sorry, but that is nothing but hearsay from our point of view. IOW, it's unreliable and untestable.

0	ah i see. so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to, unless they pay the government more money? sound a little too much like bribery to you too? and how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing? how about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society, and let people kill themselves/ruin their lives if they want to. why should i be spending tax dollars (ok, well hypothetically, pretend i pay taxes) to force someone else to not hurt themselves? sound a little counter-productive? and then we complain about a defecit? (obviously that's not the main culprit of spending, but you get the point).	it should be legalised as it's no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco. not only that but many marijuana users end up going onto harder drugs through contact with their marijuana dealer. lesgalising it would break that link and actually reduce the level of drug addicts overall. furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drugs, which would be a good thing.
0	I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.	Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.
0	I'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion. Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young. Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful.	Will some creationist point out the errors in the above? But if you do, make sure you protect your identity.
1	depends on what you mean by 'history'.  did george washington really cut down the cherry tree? that is fiction. did george washington exist? that is documented.. and is history.	your definition of science is a 'body of knowledge that pertains to reality?' that seems rather broad and...odd. don't you think this is a better definition? the observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.  i guess you equate history with fiction and fantasy.
1	Exactly, they are big on condeming the sins of those other guys. It makes them feel better about themselves. Also, it is always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homos are not going to disappear, abortion will never be made illegal. That's how the religious right recruits folks - get 'em all indignant about the "others" and they never notice they are being fleeced by the fat little pastor.	That's an interesting insight.(I'm going to have to borrow that story... :p I can't help but wonder for some people if the reason they "mature" on the issue of heterosexual sex has to do more with the fact that they start wanting to do it themselves.A desire to partake in the action, as opposed to actual mature development, causes them to shift their attitudes towards heterosexuality.To me, that's one of the reasons Christianity (in general) has such a "tolerance" for divorce, which Jesus spoke out against explicitly, while not as much tolerance for homosexuality.They want to do the divorce thing or sympathize with the desire for it, so suddenly it's more "tolerated"... emoticonXRolleyes

0	I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. Any thoughts on this?	Your analysis might be correct, although I don't think I'd bet big money on it. In particular, I'm not sure about your conclusion here:"The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken."My reading is simply that if they don't reach a conclustion in one session, they have to take it up again in the next one. If it's going to pass, it has to pass in two consecutive years, so simply taking it up in year three and saying, "Didn't pass in two consecutive years, failed" may be legit.

This is also why the thread title: "I don't have enough faith to be an atheist" is not accurate. All you have to do is believe that we weren't created by God. It doesn't in any way relate to evolution, the big bang, etc.

I put to you that you are the one discriminating on the basis of someone's size and development, since you would have it that a small, slightly developed person has a right to inhabit a womb, while a fully grown adult does not.

Georgia, where the supreme court specifically noted that there is not a single piece of conclusive evidence that the penalty is a effective deterrent.	the death penalty works.No convicted fellon excecuted by the state of Texas has evr gone on to kill again.
1	So lets see, you referred to how the 1st amendment applied to the states, posted the 14th amendment privileges and immunities clause and then asked if I thought something was unclear. Of course the privileges and immunities clause is often mistaken to have incorporated the 1st amendment by people who don't know what they are talking about but this is merely coincidence because you randomly quoted part of the 14th amendment but implied it all. Now if I changed it to what it said above would you feel that is an accurate statement? Probably, considering you don't seem to understand a blatant difference between "original understanding" and "original constitution).Your pride ruins you my friend.	The 14th amendment made the 1st amendment applicable to state governments as well. 14th amendment: "The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law..." Is there something in that you find unclear???
0	i see some names that don't seem to fit. c.s. lewis was a writer and scholar, you want to include tolkien too? aristotle was a prolific thinker but hardly conservative. it is as if you are trying to graft liberal (proper use of the word) philosophy on to traditionalism. you have rand, do you mean rand paul or ayn rand? quotes about the size of government from conservatives and founder types... it is the size of government that matters, not necessarily how it is financed. - dan mitchell senior fellow in political economy, the heritage foundation my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. - jefferson government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one. - thomas paine  what do you have to say about the 'proper' size of government?	that is of course absurd! you are pretending based on a psychological issue of yours. take your pick from the conservative intellectual canon - aristotle, chesterton, strauss, de tracy, jefferson, madison, monroe, adam smith, john locke, milton friedman, nosick, hayak, von mises, sowell, wm. buckley, kirk, burke, q. wilson, rand, patrick henry, c.s lewis, voegelin, belloc. who said what you claim conservatives say?

1	typical pro-life, woman-hating schmuck. i am pro-choice so i must be selfish whore who aborts all the time. you aren't worth the energy it takes to type.  i'm sure its no greater than your own. i mean, only a scarred woman could want autonomy, right? real women should be door mats, that way you don't ever have to attempt being a real man. way way over the line. he is an amazing, committed, loving, amazing father. maybe you, like my ex-husband, think being father is about who you ####. and like him, you probably think thats also where it ends as well. both myself and my son's adopted (real) father have higher standards than that.	well, if all you care is yourself and you are not burdened by conscience, go ahead and abort whenever it is expedient. i can see that you are so badly scarred by your bad choices in men, and your rape, that 'control over your body' has become paramount to you. it is understandable to give your son a homosexual as substitute father ? i am not so sure about that.

0	i guess you get some credit, but this seems to be way more effective.	my face is in this topic link below i started a few weeks ago, i was pretty much asking the same thing as this post, i like to see who i am debating, makes thing more personal and it helps remind me that we are all human not some internet trolls with anger issues hiding behind our computers to debate tuff issues lol.
0	That's not true -- actually, it doesn't make sense. Science is just a bunch of rules (by definition). "Biology uses science to study life" is true. "Physics uses science to study the physical world" is true, but "science's purpose is to study life" is not true.	its difficult to merge life in its purest form with science, even though science's purpose is to study life.
1	True until proven otherwise eh? Xcaliber and you must get along great.You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.No logician (and by extension no good scientist) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'.	Theories and laws are completely different. I think this paragraph should answer your questions thoroughly.
1	oh yes matt, i'm just an angry little ogre who can't stand to think that gays might find happiness in this lifetime, [sarcasm]. get a clue matthew, i have no personal investment at all regarding your life or your lifestyle. all i'm doing is sharing the spiritual truths that you hate to hear or consider. don't blame me because you live a life of delusions and self deception, because that is the life you are living. and none of those so called good people who encourage and show tolerance for your chosen lifestyle are your friends at all. and yet you prefer their lies to my truth. go figure huh?	archangel just does not want gay people to get married because he is mean. he has his marriage and does not want us to be happy.
0	Throw off our conclusions about what? I'm getting a bit confused as to what you're trying to cast doubt upon.Dark matter is stuff that doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, so again by definition anything that we can't 'see' using EM waves is dark matter. this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly	Then the issue I've raised has some merit? Is dark matter the only possible thing we can't see using EM waves, or could there be other things that could throw off our conclusions at these great distances?

1	Three days? Non Christians supposedly spend an eternity in hell, not the weekend.	Originally posted by debategirl88  1. Jesus did not go to heaven he went to hell. He couldnt go to heaven because He had all of the sins of the world on Him. If ya know anything about the Bible  you would know that sin does not go to heaven. That means Jesus spent 3 days and 3 nights in hell.
1	I'd be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who doesn't even believe in what they're selling. Those teachers may teach it, but they don't believe in it.	The fact that someone doesn't do or believe what he is selling doesn't affect the validity of the argument. There are teachers who don't believe in evolution, yet they teach it because it's standardized.
1	I note the bolding but the reason for it is as inscrutable as the peculiar form of what appears to be English which is used.	While your learned reasoned response is the not. Give me a break troll. The only misdeed is your pathetic attempt to defend the undefendable.
1	But I thought it was the easy gun laws in the U.S. that made Mexico's cities a shooting gallery? Same as L.A. and less than D.C.?   Amid Drug War, Mexico Less Deadly Than Decade Ago	Mexico City's homicide rate today is about on par with Los Angeles and is less than a third of that for Washington, D.C.Mexico City's rate was about 9 per 100,000 in 2008, while Washington, D.C. was more than 30 that year.
0	Well, assuming that when the Bible says "you" in passages that are telling "you" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says "women and men have souls." This doesn't mean they don't have them.Same thing with animals. The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says "you" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says "animals don't have souls."So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).	I have to watch for snares now? :)I didn't say it, nor does the Bible, that only males of the human race have souls.
1	'if carrying guns became legal, then police could no longer arrest people for carrying guns illegally!' emoticonxrolleyes really? i suppose you'd be happier if only the 'bad guys' were armed, because that would make them easier to identify.	you mean by enforcing the 2nd upon the states the people get the 4th amendment's protections back as well??? wonderful news!
1	Selective reading huh? Well, there is none so blind as he who will not see.	You've made some claims, but nothing has stood up to close scrutiny. I didn't see anything on the Gospels you ever documented was a lie. Just a lot of hot air and superficial understanding on your part.
0	People have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions. Many people once believed that the earth is flat:perhaps some still do. But this has nothing to do with scientific truth.There is no "version" of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities.By definition, scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment. Any law, knowledge, etc. thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account. All science in this sense is provisional.The apostles may have believed that Jesus walked on water: that does NOTmake it true.	No, your idea about science is a philiosophy of science. Sure, it's got a lot of believers, but historically it is not the only vision of science people have believed in.There is metaphysical evidence. The Apostles saw Jesus walk on water. There was no 'measure' by your version of science, but what they saw remains true.
0	so lets ban cars... they kill people... and think all the money could go to public transportation. also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry... don't forget archery... can't have the subjects have any of that... since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses, will the government be disarming too? i see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman.	if they have banned guns why are swords any different? if you don't see the need for one kind of weapon what is the point of admitting the other has a use? seems completely reasonable to me.
0	And how exactly do you propose this suggestion actually be enforced? Have you got it all thought out and prepared to defend in a debate, or are you just throwing out what the liberal loonies tell you is a good idea?	All firearm transactions must be through a FFL with a background check. First sale and any subsequent transfers of ownership. No private party to pp sales without FFL oversight.

0	Well of course it's about petitions that would lead to amendments. What else would it be about? Nevertheless it is still a voting process. That's how amendments are done. What I'm asking is, does this bill mean that ANY issue that could come up as an amendment would be illegal? And if not, (the more important question) how would they determine what constitutes civil rights. (Which you didn't answer, but rather basically said 'I don't know but rest assured they do' (to paraphrase). Get it now? Anyway, on further review, I believe that the bills only apply to whatever falls under the catagory of 'civil rights', however the heck that is to be determined! emoticonXDonno	If enough people sign a petition the process to amend the constitution is started. This bill would exclude matters of civil rights from the subjects which would be valid targets of this process. Get it now?

1	Back in 1967, societal view of marriage was opposite-sex. Wait ... it's STILL that way. (Seen the ballot initiatives around the country?!) The point is that letting blacks marry whites didn't fundamentally redefine marriage, because it was still between a man and a woman.	Oh man. You keep ignoring the HISTORICAL CONTEXT of the issue. Back in 1967, "societal views of marriage" meant SAME RACE MARRIAGE ONLY, by an overwhelming majority that supercedes that seen today against gay marriage. By a margin of 3 to 1, people DISAPPROVED of interracial marriage. Society "viewed" marriage as "between a man and a woman of the same race".
0	Well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review. The source is listed at the bottom.	So you are saying that because the gun is of value you should just let the burgular take everything else of value, Rape your wife and possibly kill you all because you might get shot? XXXX.You are now quoting that burgulars will invade homes more because there are guns in there?Again this is this frauds own personal research to meet his agenda. Please show me his raw data.. otherwise it is XXXX.Your quote starts out with fact (the 74%) then goes off into fantasy land of the quotes of one or two CRIMINALS who support your global socialist agenda and then he does "his own study". XXXX! GOA and other pro freedom groups footnote and annotate thier sources for your review not some "oh we looked at the fbi statistics and from "our own" research we have found that pistol gripped assault rifles can go on a kill crazy rampage whether or not a human is actually holding the thing" XXXX!The latest is the BATFE is XXXXXX at the brady foundation for misrepresenting their data... hmm.....

0	A more precise term would be "broaden," since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, "diluted" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only "change" would be to other  people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only "change" in that regard will be the fact that they are  encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.	1. Change the definition of a legal term, something that is done daily, to benefit a class of citizen currently discriminiated against legally and socially.

0	EZ, if the concept of Gay Jesus offends you, why do you bring up the subject incessantly? You're the only one who does this around here. Truly bizarre.For example...	Kronus, if you had the Spirit of Christ living inside you like the Bible says his followers have, you would be preaching / defending Jesus instead of warming up to a pagan infidel like Orion, who has now spent some 8 years slandering and attacking the Biblical Jesus (chanting "gay jesus") and most anyone who believes in Him.
1	I'd argue that the woman wants to control who lives or dies. That's scarier to me. emoticonXRolleyes	As I've been arguing, the pro-lifers want to control a woman's womb. It's all about power and control.
1	Really, can you show me this science? You are just as genetically similiar to a white person as you are to an embryo.	Science has actually shown that we are very genetically similar to black people, chinese people. While science has also shown that you or me are very different than the embryo.
1	Cower in fear of your god Easy, I'm not afraid, and nothing that you say is going to make me fear things which I believe to be imaginary.   Thankfully, our nation does not make laws based on your Phelpsian beliefs that god punishes the masses for the sins of others.	Gay sex is a sin and brings God's disfavor on men and nations. We don't need the extra grief. That's all you need to know.
0	Because everyone is equal in the eyes of the law, and rightly so. As for moral standing, you see no problem with equating his immoral behaviour with your own response. Most would.	They don't...but that's the principle issue behind many ACLU lawsuits and protests regarding treatment of criminals, especially if they get hurt while committing the crime. I will agree that they deserve a fair trial, but that is about all they deserve...if they live through their attempt to harm the victim. If they die trying to harm the victim, we are spared the cost of a trial.You are spot on regarding the lack of ethics or morality in the perps. They are being neither ethical nor of high moral standing...why should I have to be in my defense?
0	732,000 DIDN'T sign the petition. It seems only 5% of South Dakotans say "repeal the extreme abortion ban" and that is ASSUMING that all the signatures are valid. The good news for South Dakota is that come November they can show America how they really feel about abortion as opposed to having the courts decide laws.	South Dakotans say "repeal the extreme abortion ban!"Thanks to the hard work of 1,200 volunteers in 138 different cities and towns -- in nine weeks time -- we filed petitions with the names of more than 38,000 South Dakotans who are calling for the repeal of the extreme abortion legislation enacted by the South Dakota legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds on March 6. http://www.sdhealthyfamilies.org/
0	Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again.	What does this have to do with what you started out with. Can't you at least pick a topic and stick with it? You wander all over the place and only demonstrate you problems in understand written English.* Get an education.
0	They were both created on the sixth day according to Genesis 1.	Genesis 1:27 says that God created Adam and Eve. (I couldn't find the part about them being created "together".) No contradictions there.
0	True, but I was referring to psychological explanations, not genuine reasons.	There's more to the adoption of an atheistic stance than just rejecting the bible because it's scientifically false. 'The bible is scientific nonsense, therefore there is no god' is not a logical stance.
0	Nearly all the food humans eat today, even in the Western world is GM including maize, tomatoes, and soy, etc, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk. Essentially everything is with the exception of "organic". However, as i noted above, I wouldn't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick. I haven't read from all sides, however.	you may, but firstly, that argument may well not fly - much of the grain going to these animals is essentially the trash left over from other production to begin with, unfit for human consumption.
1	Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you	Oh...so humans all must have the same bone structure? Kind of like pigmies and Kenyans look so similar. I'll prove to you on a future post how Neandertals developed their traits -- including their bone structures through a nonrandom mechanism.
0	Anyway Duo_Maxwell this isn't only creationist debaters, there are many more who do the same thing with different debates. you also forgot7. Make random accusations of logical fallacies when they have no idea what they even mean. Example: You said that my spelling is wrong, that's the biggest strawman I've ever heard8. Correct spelling mistakes and convienantly not answer the question. Example: "What do you thinkk of carbon dating?" "you spelled think wrong". If you want to correct spelling, fine but answer the question as well.	5.)Don't think so.6.)The only thing classical ad-naeseum is your own preconceived idea's of creationism and creationist.You don't want to debate the issues like normal civil people, you just want try to make fools of creationists.

1	so you are saying that this country is based on principles of judaism? that is a date, dummy. it is not a founding principle. it was how dates were done. and 'our lord' could have been mohamed for all you know, except that it was the standard for dates. no christian principles. so at least you admit that you can't give a single location and that you can't even tell me how many times god, jesus, and religion are mentioned.	you're full of it. go back and reread my posts, including the one with biblical verses. and, to put an exclamation point on jesus and the constitution, it was dated in 'the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven.' that's right. not the lord, but our lord! there he is - jesus in the constitution!!! chew on that, o flatulent one!
0	Socialsim and Communism in the Soviet Union failed because the USSR spent its entire existence recovering from war. The country was bombed to hell by Germany twice, around the time of the world wars. The united states put unspeakable amounts of money into their war machine, which forced the Soviets to do the same. I, for one, would buy a gun If I knew my neighbor had six, and he wanted me dead.The CIA and American military carried out immoral operations in 60+ countries since 1945. The soviet KGB, as far as I know, has only been in Germany, korea, China, and Afgahnistan.	Fortunately, the Bolshevik Revolution failed. 1989, the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down, along with Soviet Ideology.Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it.

0	You can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. There are very many forms of evidence.	You are so right-on in what you say!In a Sunday school at a church I formerly attended, an elder of the church remarked that his "faith was strengthened" by the "evidence" afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east. In a tone I now rather regret, I blurted out two things......How weak was your faith before?and...If the "evidence" had gone 'the other way,' would your faith then have been weakened?His answer for the second question was a simple 'no,' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence' he was employing was not the same sense you'd expect a scientist to use.His response to the first was problematic, and interesting. "My faith," he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--"complete." But he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that I pressed no further. I wish sometimes that I'd asked: If your faith was "always complete," did the archaeological evidence make it "more complete"? And, if so, does your sense of 'complete' match that word's usual application?I do not quite grasp the notion of there being "scientific evidence" for a proposition within the realm of faith. I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint. Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms. Scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't "disprove the Bible." Rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--I call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture. I'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians' interpretations. Emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some Christians see in, for example, the Genesis "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" nothing more than a tree. A biological tree. Pear tree. Peach tree. Apple tree. Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. And, for them, there you go--Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. Lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. Metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain Christians.Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. Christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. I feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than I do about that person's science.Master_Shake, for your poignantly apt remark--"what they have isn't faith at all"--thanks. Bless you!Brad

0	Really? A human can be determined scientifically. Personhood is a human legal construct. You cannot prove scientifically what a "person" is.	Like it or not Fetus is the latin word for Baby.

0	while i can't say i'm a history buff, i'm not shocked about all that either. perhaps it's because i'm mostly a misanthropist.	indeed. it relies on an all powerful unrestrained government to run the businesses, (otherwise privet persons get rich can't have that) and distribute wealth amongst the population. but at the same time requires that same government to be genuinely benevolent which doesn't happen 9 times out of 10 when you give a person or group of people that kind of power they will abuse it. not to mention that stalin alone killed more of his own people that hitler killed jews. not to mention all the other communist leaders that also committed genocides. mao, pol pot, castro, chaves, etc. the nazis are guilty of attempted genocide compared to those guys.
0	It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. "Macro" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different.	I wasn't thinking the term 'micro-evolution' but that does work.My point was that the idea of evolution is a gradual change over a long period of time. (I've never head the term "macro-evolution" (nor "micro-evolution honestly) but I assume that's what it is until you suggest different.)I guess the change in beak size is more noticeable than gradual. My point for asking the question was from the selection that you quoted. I point out what stuck out to me...What I saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed "recent immigration," than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time, unless I misinterpreted it. But then again, I think it's possible that "micro-evolution" does happen in some birds such as finches.
1	So you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? That someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? What if it where your nipples? After all nipples on men serve no purpose.	I've got no problem with it. Geez, your not normal if you don't have it circumcised. Some woman won't want you (sexually) because of it. Babies don't remember the pain. And its not just for religious purposes, come on, the main reason is for hygienics . You could get an infection or something at an older age and have to get that done at 15-16 or so on. How painful would it be to get it then. I am happy I am circumcised, and I am glad my parents did it.
0	honestly, i am amazed, so there are actually gay people with a sense of reason. i have spent years of facing discrimination from narrow minded homosexual activists and all these years later, you are the only one that has ever demonstrated somewhat of a sense of reason beyond the same old hogwash i have seen demonstrated by thousands i have interacted with. i still have my reservations towards suspecting that somehow you might be attempting to set me up for a slam.	you misunderstand me.  i'm saying you do not speak for me. or any gay man. you are not for freedom. you are for boosting your own ego. and that, i cannot abide. as for his 'homophobia', why should i care? for all i know, he could be trolling. all i did was say his statements actually have some validity. it's not the majority of gays who do it, but still, there are sick people out there. hetero and homo alike.
1	so basically, what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever. they shouldn't teach tolerance, because that offends the intolerant; they shouldn't teach racial equality, because that offends racists; they shouldn't teach religious freedom, because that offends religious bigots. maybe they shouldn't teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers.  i am truly surprised to hear a right-winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum. but then, i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today.	it is not the existence of the gay people that moralizing families question. their opposition to them being in the video is not based on that. their view is that it shouldn't be considered a 'family' in the acceptable sense of the term. not that they exist. surely you know this. now, you and i don't agree with that, but the question here is whether or not the school should teach about issues that moralistic ones in peoples' minds, such as this one. imo, they shouldn't. there is a broader issue here. so you think censoring over the issue being a moralistic one is ridicuous, eh? so you'd have no problem with schools teaching that people should go to church? or that male kids can have more than one wife at a time when they grow up? those too are moralistic-based issues to many people.
0	Because we view it as something much more than just a gravy train from the govt., that's why.For you it seems to be about the word, and the govt. saying "oh, you use THAT term ("marriage"), ok we recognize it."

0	The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life.	The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the "quality of life" test.
0	arafat is not a worse leader than sharon... arafat steals millions in aid money that is suppose to go to the palestinians, which 80% of them are below the poverty line. arafat advocates people to xxxx themselves up so that they may kill as many jews as possible. he is the head-figure of many of these terrorist groups and pours millions of aid into them.  sharon is worse? not only has arafat contributed to many more than 1,000 israeli casualties, his 'intifada' has continued the cycle of violence and thus caused the death of more than 2,000 palestinians.	sadam was horrible, and so is arafat. but arafat is not a worse leader than sharon...

0	The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science.	The problem with ID is that there is no evidence, and it is simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove that our dating procedures were false and that really we stood on 2 legs back when the Earth was created and that the fossil record is not really as we thought it was, evolution would be falsified. Intelligent design can simply not be falsified because there is no supporting evidence for it. That is the line between religion and science.
0	1 - It is innacurate. We allow killing in times of war, in self defense, and in state sanctioned executions. So we already have a situation where, when given X mitigating factors, it is justifiable to take a life. It is impossible to say all life is equal, and then to apply that as law. People will be outraged. I know I would be.2 - Objective to who? Who gets to decide how valuable life is? And why should they get to? And who says they are right? The relative value of life works fine, thanks very much.	If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?
1	And refusing to donate your resources is killing, so I have killed someone by not donating my blood etc.	Jessica,What do you not understand Jess? I'm saying that I would restrict a woman only as much as I restrict a man. Neither would have the right to kill.
1	honk! wrong. my parents inherited a house from their parents. they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values. concepts stored in one brain, expressed via words and encoded in a new brain. epigenetic inheritance, yet still materialistic. doesn't mean they didn't also inherit a bunch of genes, and for the umpteenth time it doesn't mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like. shouldn't i be asking you that, since that's what you say happens, despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up? honk! what a great big fat juicy lie, ss. don't put it in the keep net though; toss it back so you can use it again later.	sorry to burst your bubble, but non-gene inheritance is non-materiastic inheritance, which absolutely does contradict toe. (how exactly does it happen that thought or awareness generates a new physical trait and then pass it down?) and never has it been proven that any spontaneous, randomly-occurring mutation has ever created a beneficial, selectable morphological novelty, so ultimately, it's your materialist theory that has no evidence. i have evidence, you don't.

0	having been raised in texas as a child and teen, with many relatives still residing there, i'm surprised their educational system hasn't gone to the bible as its primary textbook. perhaps things have changed, but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas. maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed, but i'd find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique.	emoticonxconfused i didn't say that, our teacher didn't show us the texas version, just jokingly told us about it. i stated earlier i am from maryland.

0	You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.	We have some major flaws in our legal system. The first and foremost legal flaw is that American prisoners are American people and thus are granted first ammendment American rights. This means that murderers who don't get birthday cakes, a basketball court, tv, and a turkey for Thanksgiving go crying cruel and unusual punishment and then they get it.I've heard that the average cost of living of a capital punishment prisoner is appoximately $25,000.00 a year paid for by us.It's really bad when murderers on deathrow in Mexico are calling murderers on deathrow in America p*****s and want to transfer here.LEVIATHAN

0	Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other.	The inanity in defence of guns continues unabated. The poor shooter probably thought, quite innocently, that his fellow countrymen might be about to shoot him with their concealed carries, he shot them first, a perfectly reasonable response.
0	Not needed? It is evolution. The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene. The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations. It is by definition, evolution.	The ONLY reason is natural selection. Evolution is not needed.
0	this statement isn't logical.It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or can't change them...or even that they apply to him. If a teacher says "no talking in the classroom" it doesn't apply to the teacher now does it.	Following the logic of several people here, whatever God says is morally correct, therefore abortions are morally correct because God said so. Let's see who's going to be consistent about their beliefs.

1	yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own.	you agreed with trebor pappy.....now you are back pedalling..re previous post

How cruel can you be	Don't be silly--no one is voting your family out of existence. Though it might make a fascinating Criss Angel or David Blane trick. This is simply about whether or not any group that wants to come along and redefine marriage should get to do so. I agree it's not an 'academic exercise', but not for the same reason you think.I no more take 'pleasure and joy' from something like this than any other public act of due process, e.g. voting to change the speed limit.Frankly, I've always thought it was pretty odd--if not downright disturbing--that some gay pride proponents seem to hold up the legality of their union as the determinant of their joy and emotion, when they are completely free to have whatever union they want regardless. After all, no one's going to block the door to the chapel, and I can guarantee you I'd be joyfully married with or without that piece of paper called a license.

Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad (or constitutional), or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad (or constitutional), it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban.

I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the "18 and over execution rule" in the eighth amendment.	We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.

Just interjecting...several of the letters attributed to Paul were not writen by his hand according to most biblical scholars.

0	I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, "And the truth shall set you free"!!!	Give to God what belongs to God. Give to science what belongs to science
0	Yes, you are missing something. How come age doesn't start at conception? How come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old.	So they (pro-life peeps) say abortion is murder. Of course, you can only murder people. So their rule is that fetuses (feti?) are people also. But then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the US Census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage. Pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.Or am I missing something? Care to clarify, anybody who disagrees?

1	Abortion is not immoral? End of story? Simone, are you trying to impose your own personal moral code upon me? Well I never....	Hmmm, I just think it is dead wrong to force your morals upon someone else and especially heinous when your morals are WRONG.Abortion is not immoral. End of story.
0	it can't always be cared by anyone. What if no one wants the baby or you can't get to a place where you can give the baby up (maybe snowed in for a week). Can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you.	And, of course, you totally miss the point.The point is that a 1-day-old infant can be cared for by ANYBODY! It is no longer dependent upon the body and resources of only one person.But, of course, if that one person is only a lowly, less than human woman, that lowly person has absolutely no rights to compare with that of the almighty, holy fetus.
1	Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns.	It has 'splintered' in the fact there are more than one way to interpret things.. and how strictly one follows the rituals.  On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be the antagonisation between the various viewpoints that there are with Chistianity.. although some of the ultra-conservative are a bit snooty.. that attitude is very much in the minority though.
1	Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.	Yes he is. Correct. Which leaves anyone believing that nonsense in the OP looking rather foolish Best rush out and buy an extra gun or two in case it might be true. ;)
0	You are very right. We too will have to pay tax on the insurance for me. Not fair.	And this is a terrific breakthrough. My partner and I are coveered by my company's health insurance, and the state of Connecticut honors our Civil Union. That being said, I still have to pay tax on my partner's health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union.So it has to be marriage. Full and without exception.Civil Unions are not enough when we are treated differently under the law.
1	are you a little bit retarded or something? don't get me wrong sleazyrider i love babies, they're delicious!	go do a google search and find out. how many babies have you supported killing?
0	let me guess - you also believe that moses wrote the torah, wherein he describes his own death and burial? 'wild theory'? i suggest you do an internet search on the synoptic problem and the related two-source theory.  why do you demand that which you know cannot be produced? no, we don't have the q source, but we have evidence which points to a q source. likewise, we have a great deal of evidence which suggests that the torah had multiple authors.	this is nonsense. iremaeus and clement of alexandria both attribute the gospel of john to john. these liberal theories of yours are only that - theories, with no historical, archeological, or traditional evidence to support them.  the q source is just another wild theory without any trace of historical, traditional, or archaeological evidence to support it. the earliest church fathers attributed the gospels to the apostles or authors whose names they presently bear.
0	Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed.	the big news here has nothing to do with dinosaurs and chickens: it's that proteins were found in dinosaur bones after supposedly 68 million years.
1	Do you know how many Osama Bin Ladens we Killed???? emoticonXRolleyes	40 million people have died because they were aborted. How many Einsteins or Edisons did we kill? What kind of great change have we prevented?
1	Actually, isn't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing? Creationists even have a magazine formally called "Ex Nihilo" (changed to "Creation" because creationists didn't know what it meant.)	What great faith you evilutionists have in nothingness! LOL
0	i'm a little surprised by this. the polls i've seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage. i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem.	mass. lawmakers delay vote on gay-marriage ban  http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060713/...ghts_gays_dc_1 the anti-gay family groups (mass resistance, etc.) are not happy about this move. time is on our side, as more time passes more and more people are in support of full marriage equality.
0	There are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth. Some use 'science' to say that the world is flat. Granted that these beliefs aren't widely accepted, but then not all religions are widely accepted. By your reasoning or 'logic' you must ask yourself about whether you should rely on science when there are many different scientific theories.The Flat Earth News, at least back then, had a regular column, "One Hundred Proofs Earth is Not a Globe."(go to http://www.flat-earth.org/)Other theories taught as sciencephrenologyalchemyevolutioneugenicsneptunismTheories of the Aether Articles relating to the Emergence of Scientific Theories of the Cosmic Aether(http://www.mountainman.com.au/aether.html)What about 'metascience'?http://www.calresco.org/lucas/science.htmOr, sciences used to support political ends...What about Marxist Sciencehttp://www.marxists.org/archive/hald...philosophy.htmor Chaos Theory and Marxismhttp://www.marxist.com/science/chaostheory.htmlThere's Nazi Sciencehttp://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/naziscience.htmlNationalist Sciencehttp://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htmOr social ends...Scientific Racismhttp://www.press.uillinois.edu/f02/tucker.htmlMainstream scientists instead of using the word 'heretic' use the word 'pseudo-science' to categorise fringe beliefs.	so yes the existance of other religions can be seen as disproof for your god, becuas logic dictates that you must ask yourself why your god didint speak to people in asia or south america.
1	To bad you don't have the power to define the situation.	Shouldn't you be assembling examples of vicious prosecution for self-defence in Australia with which to beat me over the head?

1	All sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you.	I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.

1	Where do you get off saying that kind of tripe to somebody?  That kind of insane comment is typical of far left loons like you who lie for a living and don't have the common sense of a fence post.  And that goes for Jo Bennett too if he's agreeing with you.  Cretins.	i read it the first time. your are trying to argue that your experience was somehow unique and the way it happened excludes you from those who do what everyone else is doing. there is absolutely nothing in your personal story that is remarkable in anyway. as i said before just because you don’t realize it doesn’t mean that it is not influencing you to do what everyone else is doing. it happens to everyone including stupid arrogant people with an i’m special attitude. your thinking is so screwed up that it precludes from knowing that. you really think your something special but you’re not your just another brain dead clone.
1	i love when differing from someones opinion is 'weak'. such a convincing argument.	sympathetic jurors do not make decisions based on facts. there is no need for you all (y'all) to feel as i do. god forbid we should all think alike. i'm just getting feedback...seeing who really has balls and who doesn't, among other things. i trust all my peers to be human. considering the bell shaped curve of possible reactions to various stimuli, that's not saying much. regarding the mental illness, why don't we just lock up mentally ill murderers for the rest of their lives?..no release for any reason whatsoever including some future psychiatric evaluation that claims the murderer is now ready to go back into society?
0	i think this is something everyone on here can get behind. at least i would hope so. saying that fred phelps is an embarrassment to this nation and my home state would be a gross understatement. sadly, i can't say i'm surprised by this, but i definitely don't think i would have ever predicted it. what he is doing is despicable. and what the patriot guard is doing is amazing. i like the sentiment involved in attempting to pass laws against protesting at funerals (although i don't know if they'll hold up in court), i only wish they had felt the same when he was protesting aids victims.	http://www.cnn.com/2006/us/02/21/fun....ap/index.html 'they call themselves the patriot guard riders, and they are more than 5,000 strong, forming to counter anti-gay protests held by the rev. fred phelps at military funerals. the church, westboro baptist church, is not affiliated with a larger denomination and is made up mostly of fred phelps' extended family members.

0	Exactly. Most people would incorporate it, from childhood most often. Steeeeve can't seem to wrap his mind around that.	I suspect that a lot of people, if not most people, at least partially follow some version of "treat others as you would have yourself be treated". When, as children, we were scolded "How would you like it if ..." that is a tactic of teaching this rule. For those who are religious (which I only marginally, occasionally and hesitatingly am), even Jesus stated "Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you." in the Sermon on the Mount talk (as quoted by ShadowPikachu). Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule, which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality.

1	absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years.	** absolute nonsense. ** utter garbage.

1	Exactly my point! After four pages he finally gets it! Give him a hand! There's a brain in that head after all! But my point is, that unless you do disagree with the stats, your argument is irrelevant.   [QUOTE]What I have been saying for the last three pages is that your question is idiotic, as you're comparing things which are completely different in function. They are not analogous.	This is exactly what I mean. Show me exactly where I disagreed with your stats. Quote my post. Post the mother####er. I never said your stats were wrong. Let me say that again:I never said your stats were wrong.
1	yeah, like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will. you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them? i was going to say that you live in your own little world, but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen.  what? either try that again, or find someone who can translate. i kinda thought that the insecure, paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security. i don't need to carry a gun, i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me. i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security, and as such, want to carry a gun. there is a difference.	well, it seems that even the simplest of messages failed to penetrate some thick (sick) skulls: without guns you can not shoot and kill anybody. civilized remove all guns from circulation and do their utmost to also make gus unavailable to criminals and it works. only insecure, paranoid people with and inferiority complex need guns as a security blanket. grow up!

0	just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.	You can preach pretty religious philosophy all day long but I ain't buying. Saying that Jesus told you that all life is special doesn't comfort a rape victim, doesn't provide health care to a woman without it, doesn't feed a family if a single mom has to quit her job, doesn't provide an education if she has to quit school. Reducing women to pretty quote that is hung in your kitchen doesn't mean squat out in here in the real world, and it doesn't indicate that you get it, let alone care.
1	Nice spin. Would you have preferred "the civilized world" instead? Or Western Civilization or Gay Western Civilization? Your preference? One case in 1959 isn't a pandemic.	Actually, you are very incorrect in that matter. Before it's spreading to the United states, it was predominately a heterosexual disease in africa. It's disease vector into the north american contanent just so happened to have been via a gay man, yes,.. so it was in that population in north america that got hit the hardest. However, your statement on a 'world wide' basis is the sheerest ignorance.
0	The goal of anti-abortionist is clear. The job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters.	A few blocks from my house there is a group of stores with some offices on the second floors. Apparently there is a Planned Parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti-abortion protestors were there the other day. I didn't know that before then. I wondered what they hoped to accomplish by their protest so I asked them. One woman said she hoped to discourage women from considering abortion. I didn't think of it at the time, but Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortion services. I wonder if the protests might also dissuade a young woman who was seeking contraceptive services from going into that office as well. If this were the case, the abortion protests would accomplish the opposite of their goal. They potentially could have increased the chances of an unwanted pregnancy by discouraging contraceptive use. In turn, this might increase the chances of an abortion. I wonder if anti-abortion folks ever consider that?
0	They need to keep their opinions to themselves and out of the law the effect gay peoples lives. I see nothing wrong with locking up those who incite hatred towards gay people just as we lock up people who shout fire in a crowded theatre.	[i][indent]"Canada has "hate" speech/crimes laws and regulations and Canadian Christians, along with other people of faith, are being vehemently persecuted for speaking out publicly against the acceptance and promotion of homosexuality within their own country. I was told by Rev. Tristan NOT to bring most of our resources on homosexuality, for going through the Canadian border, they might get seized and I could possibly be denied entry into Canada. I was able to bring several hundred of SBM's tracts for the attendees, "I Was Gay" and "The Traditional American Family."

1	True they should have passed raincoats and knee boots to protect peoples clothes from the XXXX that the president was spewing out.	I don't see that either of them were "protesting". I would however say that they were both making a statement. Cindy even makes it clear in her letter that she was making a statement. Now I certainly think that Cindy should have been simply removed rather than arrested, but whats done is done. I am glad to see that the senators wife was removed as well. I have nothing against the positions expressed on either of their shirts. I do however believe that the only one who should be making a statement at the SOTU is the president, and therefore I would in the future support the removal of anyone who follows this path. Perhaps a dress code would eliminate this XXXX in the future. Apparently decorum means nothing anymore.
1	Absolutely. Because atheists are spiritually constipated and are too dumb to realize God and Christ are real.	Do you believe they (atheists) should not be allowed to display their message but the church should be allowed to display theirs?
1	what are you talking about?!?! the constitution was written in the late 1700's we have to go by thier meaning not a modern interpretation, this is most silly. as for your quote on adams i do not see how that even remotley applies to this discussion... care to expound?	since reverend hellhound insists on using an antique definition of 'well-regulated', i think it will be interesting to examine an antique definition of 'the people'. the founders defined 'the people' rather narrowly.  john adams explained that women were not part of 'the people' because 'nature has made them fittest for domestic cares' and women were unfit for 'the great business of life, and the hardy enterprises of war, as well as the arduous cares of the state'. servants and those who didn't own land were also not part of the people because they were 'too little acquainted with public affairs to form a right judgement, and too dependent upon other men to have a will of their own.' (works of adams 9:375-378)
0	So what? It's not like institutions in this country haven't been changed before, including the supposed intitution of marriage! Guess what? It's called progress, get used to it.	Gay marriage will change the institution.
0	These aren't the only two options available. The many philosophical views of the material world or ethics don't mean these two things don't exist.	Modern-day citizens are far more likely to be aware of the sheer range of religious views in human cultures, past and present, and the consequent improbability that just one of them (and hey, waddaya know? It's mine!) is wholly true and all the others wholly false. This leads some into woolly New-Age-ist pick-and-mixing; others to conclude that the world's religions are all the product of a similar, purely mundane, process of cultural evolution, and that none actually reflects fundamental truths.

0	Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.	And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is.

I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me."Shes Jewish too so shes definitly not on Hitlers side.
0	It isn't offered to make that assertion at all. It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price.	Regarding the Exodus passage: Why should men fighting each other, hitting a pregnant woman, and thereby causing her to miscarry or give birth prematurely (take your pick on which is the better translation) be considered "abortion" in the first place? It seems to me the position of the woman is rather different in the two scenarios!I'm not saying abortion is always morally acceptable, not by a longshot. But I'm also not saying it never is, either.
0	i'm not 100% sure what set of facts you are working from, but they are not the correct ones i assure you. way more jewish people were killed than died in the iraq war. when you add everyone killed in wwii iraq is not even a comparison. let me make it clear, i'm debating the lesser of two evils here, (speaking of the war, i'm not for the assassination of bush. you can't kill someone for being an idiot, if so kill everyone who elected him, not just him... which would be more people than wwii and iraq war combined by the way)... where was i? oh yeah, there's no comparison. it's an evil (though crazy) ass who caused millions upon millions to die, vs. spoiled governor's son way too dumb for his position listening to douchebags like dick.	how would you save millions? hitler saved the german economy, prevented the spread of communism, and made many important achievements. killing bush, however, will save many iraqis and preserve the american economy and kill off a major terrorist. http://tv.globalresearch.ca/2012/10/bush-and-blair-wanted-war-crimes

1	which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie.	while adolf did in fact gain followers that were 'christian', to say that he gained 'christian followers', is in the very least a misrepresentation. this is a lie and can only be substantiated by an athiest website, ie; 'nobelief.com' your insistance that christianity is the great 'evil' in the world, is relevant to the lie you stated above. interesting accusation foundit, you attempt to disparage archangel for his christianity, while you just count the scriptures irrelevant along with every other religious institution, and make up your own morality. frank caliente doing his john madden imitation 'here's a guy who knows so much about so little he can judge the ethics of somebody who actually has ethics, while having no ethics of his own! will brett favre come back, i don't know lets ask foundit66, he seems to know everything about nothing'
0	So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.	Now look here, boy, I'm tired of you spreading this ignorant bull****. I came from the UK, I lived there most of my life, I saw the truth that you choose to ignore because it's inconvenient for you.The police have been caught intentionally miscounting the number of crimes reported by the people, they've been doing it for years. The people of the UK also don't report every instance of when they've been victimized. These two facts mean that any evidence you use to support your flawed position is untrustworthy and doctored to reflect whatever you want it to. You might as well be citing yourself!Even one of the biggest advocates of the post-Dunblane handgun ban admitted that the ban was a huge failure, because even school children were able to get access to guns and kill their classmates.Don't you ever spread this lie again, we know that there's no ounce of truth to it! And that's coming from a former subject of the UK, somebody who saw it first hand!
0	As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity.	No, faith and reason are mutually exclusive. Science is based on reason.

0	So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?	I'm glad you made the same correlation I did. ToE is a substitute for #### in this case.
0	Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a "link," whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!	Anyhow, I have no problems with the Archaeopteryx. It was an interesting creature, but simply having features present from two different forms (bird and dinosaur) doesn't mean it is a link?

0	Nope. Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step, making entirely new genes. Often, this is disastrous, but sometimes, a useful new enzyme results.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.	It sounds to me that this "new" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find.
0	Mach, your ability to make the wrong argument on the wrong post continues. I ask a question of this person, you reply not to them, but to me, and with ad hominem, and a 'just-so' statement.	Ironic, since your "Out of China" post was basically the same as this post.You even claim you had no debate point, you were just posting "information". It wasn't until you claimed that evolution relied on those two mutual theories that we proceeded to debate. Maybe this young 13 year old christian is just following in your golden footsteps...you might give them a little leeway if you, yourself, do this as well. Or are you above the rules of the average forum participant? Hmmm.-Mach
0	That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists. And that is what I was getting at originaly. Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid.	Both atheists and agnostics will tell you they see no evidence for the existence of any god. Some will continue with "thus, there is not one" and other will continue with "as for the other, i don't know". The agnostic position is obviously tentative, however even though the atheist does not explicitly state his position is tentative, you will be hard pressed to find an atheist who states "there is absolutely, positively, with out a doubt, no god at all".
0	Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.	I support legalization of every drug. I'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like "Marijuana will kill you." Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug.
0	I dunno... we already have enough fundies thinking that the Big Bang is part of evolution...	Actually, I probably should have included the Big Bang to show the complete body of knowledge that opposes the fundamentalist interpretation of the bible.

0	That is what supersport is hoping to do... However, assuming that you are correct in your interpretation, he has no chance of doing it so well.	That reminds me of the discussion I got into on a "christian" board when I referred to a particular pompous XXX as a pompous XXX. I was banned for a week for using profane language. Pointing out that an XXX is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless. My answer was to demand that they ban some versions of the Bible because they told of how Abraham tied his XXX to a tree and Jesus sat on his XXX in Jerusalem. Didn't phase them. They also ignored without comment references to Judge Roy Moore's monumental erection in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court building.
0	that's an interesting observation. by what means are you reasonably sure? do you think the other religions have the same take on it as you do? i used to think the same: if there is only one god, then they had to be worshipping the same, just giving him different names. then i was introduced to matt.7. clearly god only wants identifying (ex.6:3, 15:3 etc.) and worshipping one way, therefore all other religions have to be wrong. just a thought.	i'm talking about god in general, but since you mention it i'm reasonably sure that christians, jews, muslims and (possibly) hindus are worshipping the same god. even if we just take the abrahamic religions we're still looking at about 2/3 of the world's population.

0	wikipedia is really quite amazing actually. you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it. that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors. but, there are millions of contributors. each going over and correcting information supplied by others. in my mind (given the current number of users) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information.	oh how arrogant, wikipedia is a grand tool for general information.  are you telling me that tiktaalik fossils, archeopteryx fossils and platypus don't exist, and that using wikipedia is somehow misleading in this sense?  these things do exist and i didn't think it necessary to cite peer reviewed material on such trivial matters.
1	NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!

1	got anything more than your opinion that proves scientifically that the athletes will be completely safe and breathing pristine air with the factories shut down 2 weeks before the games start, and only half the cars taken off the road each day? i mean, it took a decade or more before the la basin declared victory over the dangerous pollutants that prevented asthmatics from going outside on certain days after we attacked the same problem back in the 70s. so don't you think it's a tad naive to think everything will be honky dory after 2 short weeks with these limited actions? and don't forget the neighbors the link mentions and their unending pollutants that will continue to come in on those same winds.	your same article says that 'meteorologists say china must shut them down a few weeks before'. yes, it could easily dissipate in 2 weeks. diffusion is much more efficient than you'd think, especially if there is wind involved...

0	i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human. then why do we stop at a fertilized egg? if you mean potential, is supposed to become, or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being. if we say based on results then killing is killing. the reasons are irrelevant, there is no difference between abortion, capital punishment or self defense.  yes these are extreme, but its where your position leads. at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far, but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another.	look, i lost my response; i'm not going to retype it because in hindsight i was just repeating the same thing: you and i both know the issue is the morality of the act, choice is meaningless because all the law is, is the use of force to prevent (or prevent further) immoral choices. me condemning something as immoral is the same as advocating it be outlawed which is the exact same 'making a decision' as telling someone that just because they can kill others doesn't mean it's their choice. the high dollar question is whether the fetus is human, biologically it is; not at the time all that a human can be but none of us ever achieve that. you said you are concentrating on 9 months, i don't see a difference you can abort child rearing just as easily after birth by killing the child or abandoning it.

0	And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy, the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller. Doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold.	[Brain size is relevant compared to the rest of the body - its the proportions that matter. If you're small then you can have a smaller brain,this contradicts evolutionists' position. They have long measure brain size and correlated it with intelligence. Take homo erectus, for example. Evolutionists have long said homo erectus was some sort of sub-human because of the size of his brain. It doesn't matter that Turkana boy was short at about 5'5 and 10-13 years old -- and that his head size did not look proportionally small -- today's scientists don't care about any of that. They just measure his skull.
1	You're right, why not simply kill these people in the shortest amount of time possible. I got it! We can advertise each killing (hanging, rock slaying, Guillotine, etc.) weeks in advance, kinda like moves, and show it on pay-per-view. You can buy tickets to watch the show live as well. I mean c'mon, if we're going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome, cost efficient, and swift method possible. Right? That is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago.   Honestly, how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders. In regards to the death penalty debate, it falls along a continuum between morality and scientific reasoning.	ask yourself this smiley, who gets life without parole ? mass muderers, first degree killers, pre meditated murderers, multiple offense rapist/killers, child abducter/rapist/murderers and convicted 3 strike violent felons. are you telling me that brutally violent repeat offenders who get off on causing human misery deserve the comforts of home as punishment for commiting these heinous crimes ? you see, i firmly believe that men can commit such terrible crimes that they forfeit their rights to breathe our air any longer. but short of the death sentance, then yes, life without parole should be hard and no fun whatsoever, and i mean ever.
1	I agree, it is pure genius...especially how it has infiltrated politics and governments. emoticonXBanghead	Its pretty clear that the attributes of God were made up along the way over the course of history, for different motivations from explaining disasters and natural phenomenon, to comforting greiving loved ones, to controlling the masses and justifying the whims of the rulers. When things started to get hairy in terms of logical contradictions, they threw in "God moves in mysterious ways" and "God's ways are higher than ours", in an attempt to shut up the independent thinkers with questions the priests couldn't answer. Truly genius, the legacy still goes strong to this day.

0	How do you know there isn't a tiger in the bathroom? You feel very strongly and have over-whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom? (You live in an urban area, there are no zoos, you don't hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle, and the water is going) But you cannot prove a negative. Which is also why you won't be able to prove that creationism is wrong, and why we can't prove evolution is wrong. The focus must be on proving one right. How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought.	False. This is not a valid definition of atheism. Atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). Certainly, if I said "there isn't a tiger in my bathroom", I wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. It's called being reasonable.

1	apparently you need to read up on up-to-date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics. that's right, and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well. so? i guess you'd also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it's born too, with that reasoning. there are many, many women in the pro-life movement. my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am. (trust me, you don't want to be in a room with her after you've killed a baby!) if you think this is a men versus women issue, you are sadly mistaken.	the fetus is non-sentient, so it has no 'desire'. the fetus is totally dependent on a woman's body, and has no existence without the woman's body. this is not the case with a dog. this is not the case with the woman. she is a sentient person, and not a container. she undergoes physical changes and physical risks by being pregnant. she risks, and she sacrifices, using her own body. it is selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life. it will never have the same kind of impact on his health and on his life, that it will have on hers. not even close.

0	That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X.	This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.
0	You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons?How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others. Before you respons think about it. Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment? Lots of cannons? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly.	So what. Congress can pass any law it wants. Doesn't mean it will stand up in court.The first portion, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State," is a qualifier to what follows "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." It seems pretty clear to me. But I'm not one of the Justices. This decision has been made, although I don't like it or agree with it. I don't see where today's hobbyist meets the intent - most especially in the well-regulated part. But there comes a point where what the dead guys thought just doesn't matter that much. It is 200+ years later. They left us with the ability to adjust with time and we've done that. They recognized their own shortcomings which might have the the wisest thing they did. The current interpretation is clear. We look at the last portion of the statement only. I don't think that, as I said before, a little common sense, is going to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way.After all, I could easily argue (if I was totally stupid) that my front yard is the perfect place for a working cannon. We both know that isn't going to fly. Just where does the armament argument end. With a cannon? Or with a Nuc. Let's face it. They said arms and they meant arms. Not guns. They'd probably let me have the cannon. The founding fathers never envisioned the kind of weapons we'd have available today or what they'd be used for. That's why their thoughts are purposely criptic and open ended. Since we will always draw the line someplace, why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me.
1	wow, i don't understand how this keeps happening. i'll try to switch mice.	when we demean the holocaust, and the symbols supporting it, we begin to erase those lessons. so you are saying we should try and forget about it? learning about the holocaust is great, and as horrible as it sounds it is probably for the better that it happened. why do i say this? well if it hadn't happened then it would have happened eventually (almost everyone hated jews, blacks and homosexuals at the time), and it happening taught us a valuable lesson. it's horrible to look at it like that; but it is quite true, whether you think so or not. we need things like this to happen in order to grow and develop and mature as a species.
0	Just how do you suppose the government seeking permision would work in reality? And what exactly are you afraid of? It seems odd when people advocate blind trust for Joe Civilian, but then think that the government shouldn't be allowed to be armed. I think there must be a balance in trust given both ways.	Then they can seek permission from us to arm themselves, and only for official duties that require it. Afterwards they can just turn them in and go back to being in their proper place.
0	What's "cumulative selection?" Do you mean a series of mutations with small but beneficial influence that occur over the period of thousands or millions of years? Just how do you propose to observe such mutations? In fact, we can observe such mutations by comparing the genomes of related species.	...yet the types of mutations that are required for cumulative selection have never been observed.
1	Doesn't surprise me lets all jump ship and put our heads in the sand... Even more of a reason I should run for public office :p	The reason simones threads turn to Yobama is because she is attacking Rick Warren as if he is responsible for anything the Ugandan Government does. Simones link attempts to link Warren to this legislation because of his relationship with a Ugandan Pastor, but according to this Newsweek article, Warren broke ranks with this Pastor back in 07 precisely because of these attitudes and opinions of his. And notice the date of this article, it is very current. Pastor Rick Warren Responds to Proposed Antigay Ugandan Legislation - The Human Condition Blog - Newsweek.com

0	Actually, if you count the Kinsey 4,5, and 6's you get 18%. It's 10% for the 5s and 6s. That'd be the people that prefer the same sex over opposite for the most part. 2,3,and 4 would be those who are bi and lean slightly one way or the other. 0 and 1 are people who pretty much always choose opposite sex over same. 0 and 6 are very rare though. Anyway, 10% of people are a 5 or 6. About 3% are a full 6.Could Jesus have been asexual? In certain philosophies asexuality is considered a sign of enlightenment. For instance, after becoming enlightened, the Buddha rejected sexual desires.	LOL, Joe, Kinsey was a flake and his analasis had been disproven time and agaim. David and Jonathan were not lovers. The Bible refers to love in this case as that between BROTHERS And Paul's ministry? God called him to be single. Nice try, but the target is 8' to the right.
0	well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer.	the only reason that it will be a mac is because of the information that is still inside of the computer that should be removed if you want to take the whole brain. you have to remember that the human mind is not just a hard drive. it is also the processor (brain) as well as the motherboard (connector of inputs and outputs) and the ram (short term memory). there is nothing else in the human body that can better fit the role of any of these four components. this is also the core of what determines if a computer is a mac or a pc. if you take all these pieces from your pc and put them in a mac then you have a pc. this is the case since you will be able to run pc-only applications and not mac-only applications.

0	Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? Where do they get that power Constitutionally? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally. I think that marriage is a church issue. Let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. But leave marriage to the churches.	You're a bit late there, aren't you? Marriage has become a state institution as much as a religious one, and I see no practical way to undo that at this point.
0	The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life.	But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry.
1	'blah blah blah'? look, you weighed in here on what i said, making an issue of whether it was internal, empatically making a point that it was action. as i said, i'm basically agreeing with you on the whole thing here about there needing to be equality in this situation, so i don't know why you're being so eager to find something to disagree over here.	blah, blah, blah. so you find playing word games more edifying than speaking out against homophobia. or homophobic actions, as you seem to prefer. you may find that some people find that preference a reason to question your commitment to gay rights.
1	I already have, hence the explanation I provided. If you challenge me to show you an error then I will. Did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if I could convince you it wasn't? When you post your evidence it usually has holes in it, not always but the truth is funny that way. It is very difficult sometimes to cover it up.And stay away from those shrimp, eagles, gays and snowmenThey are all abominations.	Go do your own homework. I'm not busting my butt for a certified Christ-denier who never admits anything when information is provided. Figure it all out yourself.

0	Well said.   With this religion, the gap is very wide between the "average guy" and "authority", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government.	But evolutionists are just as religious as Christians: they have their own unseen miracles – (random mutations)….their own clergy (scientists)…their own Bible (The Origin of Species)....and their own god (Natural Selection).
0	So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. You just want it used judiciously? Same here. Where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously.	The death penalty assures that an incorragable criminal never has the opportunity to kill anybody else. In prison, the criminal could a) kill another inmate, 2) kill a guard, 3) escape and kill a civilian, 4) have their sentence commuted and get out to commit another crime. Quote:Would you agree if the death penalty was banned?No, for the reasons stated above and one more. Some people don't deserve to live....like SH, for example.__________________True , gang members put in prison often kill other opposing gang members in prison so that is true. They also get put in prison and are proud some of them , gang leaders consider it a mark of honor something some of them getting caught by the 'fuzz' and put in jail. Who are we to decide who is to live? What makes us so much better? Hitler didnt deserve to live but that does not give us the right to kill him.I agree with shooter and proud but hey heres a situation, why don't we give murderers fates to the ones most hurt by their crime, and rapists fates are decided by the ones t hey rape. They would know the best. IF the ones raped are too young such as under maybe 10 or are like seven or its a loved one and they can't seperate justice from love, then the case be decided by law. Give them the chance to live in solitary confinement, give them the chance, we can always take it away. But those killed don't get no more chances. In prison if they do kill put them in confinement. Same with the others, if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine. But gang murders should be different, if someone is in jail for killing a gang member in a fight or something like that , it is murder but it isnt as open and as clear justice as it is if they shot a four year old in the head for being related to someone in an opposing gang. Then its wrong flat out, solitary or death penalty. Personally Id be for giving them death penalty for anyone who would do that. But I have two three year old cousins who I love to death and would kill anyone who harmed them so I do not want anyone to get away with killing kids. Child killers are some of the worst criminals there are.

0	how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?	simple: there was no copying. only a fool would expect a definitive answer. congradulations on finding a source. now, what is wrong with this: 'first, it cannot explain the differences among the writers' in that source? i can't tell that since you ripped my answer out of its context. you'd have to have proof that that is what occurred. and you can't. and why? it did for 1700 years till non-believers came along.
0	To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more "preposterous".	To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
0	Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?Genesis says that all creatures were specially created. It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.Statis is the norm not the exception.One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?	If you think evolution cannot explain any change then why pick the avian lung in particular? Maybe try and show how genesis can integrate almost or more observations in a meaningful way than evolution, then genesis competes, otherwise it does not.
1	Quite amusing that you refer to westerners as Gringos. The last time I heard that was in a film about Pancho villa!	whatever 'rubber' was being exported probably ceased to be exported because of ravages of war during and after.Did you see any spike in the price of tyres, sorry 'tires' in the good old USA because of the Vietnam war ?natural rubber by the way is used mostly in big huge tyres not the size used in automobiles.Iraq was invaded to satisfy greed and ideology. American oil companies are still trying to get a preferential deal in their dealing with the Iraqi government.Now, what are the gringos and their lackeys (UK, NATO members et al) doing in Afghanistan, which has no oil, and no rubber? Are the gringos trying to protect and control the supply of heroin ? Myabe Saddam hid his WMDs (Weapons of Mass Delusion) in Kabul or nearby?
0	I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard.	Yeah, there are those who scream that self-defence is not a valid reason for gun ownership. There were no valid reasons until the libs thought them up, but I'll set that aside for now. The question here is wether or not you think hunting is a valid reason for gun ownership. I don't forsee any stats posted, as this thread has nothing to do with crime. So this is a chance for you to work on debating skills.
0	I have posted responses to Demon38's earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light.	Science is different. In science it's a matter of who has the most convincing evidence. If we are to give Christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidates, can you HONESTLY tell me that creationsim is the best answer? If so (and I extend the challenge I made to Lappster) educate and enlighten us. I am eager (as always) to read the evidence for myself.

0	How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by "less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.	If we try to weed out the irresponsible ones, the poorer and less fortunate ones will get punished.
0	i'm very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees.	no benefits for laid-off religious workers - upi.com another example of religion getting special perks that they shouldn't have. and unfortunately, somebody else gets bit in the end. i find it difficult to believe that the religious organizations didn't realize they weren't paying unemployment tax. emoticonxrolleyes when they were busy not paying taxes, did they think that was a tax that they were somehow paying? it sounds like at least some religious organizations recognize the impact of their not paying taxes upon others, and take the responsible route to ensure that they as employers do right by their employees (e.g. catholic diocese of richmond). these people shouldn't have to needlessly suffer such an unexpected financial loss, but in the end it's the church that is to blame. they have been enjoying a benefit in not having to pay this tax, and now it's somebody else who suffers...
0	Cases v United States, 131 F. 2d 916 (1st Cir. 1942), cert. Denied sub nom., Velazquez v. U.S, 319 U.S. 770 (1943). Basically, The US Curcuit Court upheld that the Second Amendment didn't apply to weapons that couldn't be carried by an individual.	The term 'bear arms' usually referred military service at the time of the writing of the second amendment. This is evident from the first draft of the second amendment in which James Madison states, 'no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.' Although the pro-gun lobby likes to equate 'bearing arms' with carrying a gun, to James Madison the term meant 'to render military service.' Lastly, what arms were they founders referring to? Muskets, not machine guns, semi-automatic assault rifles nor Uzis. Obviously, using the second amendment to oppose laws regulating such weapons is highly questionably."

0	i'm surprised that some people still aren't aware of what the chinese have done to upgrade their country. sure, certain areas like the financial sector are still lagging (which is why they won't float the yuan just yet), but when it comes to industry and infrastructure they're done a most admirable job. does anybody here also think it's kinda funny that a communist country is beating the us at their own game (i.e. capitalism)?	current us policy is moving towards a 27.5% tariff on all chinese products. with the exception of a few, inefficient but politically protected industries, the us produces few of the consumer goods we now import from china. what we do manufacture is so out of line with labor/compliance costs to be totally uncompetitive even if the chinese doubled their prices. does anyone think the us public, with stagnated wages, understands that move will be a substantial direct increase in their cost of living? is the administration counting on blind patriotism for public approval of again having their wallets lifted? or, does anyone else see this as a move to increase consumer spending in an effort to keep expanding the internal transaction driven gdp? as in the net difference from wholesale to retail price, our usual crisis management style in lieu of long-range planning.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050526/...us_china_trade

'gulping for air, i started crying and yelling at him: 'what do you mean? why did you lie to me?' mrs clinton writes.  doesn't sound like such a swingin good time ey what? but don't take my word for it, go down to the library and read pg 502.  i stand by my previous thesis.	yet you have no idea what kind of marriage bill and hillary have. they could have and open marriage, or a swingers understanding. bill gets to have his way with all the women he wants too and so does hillary.
1	And how is that? Your stereotypical view is supposed to represent "truth"?? LMAO. B**** (and I mean that "lovingly") I'm friggin married. For 10 years. I don't accept "gay sex proposals", unless it's from my husband. And he ain't "white". I had my flings with y'all....and y'all ain't right. I moved on. And learn to use English "correctly". A remedial English course is recommended. And I have never lived in Sodom. I'm a Houstonian. B^^^^.	You would if it involved a gay sex proposal. Then you'd hop on it in a New York minute. So don't add lying in addition to being an unrepentant, racist Sodomite.
1	Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics. Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number. I am sure that IRS, GOD, and Hovind can work it all out.	Is this the same Kent Hovind found guilty of tax evasion? I dunno where Christians get their morals from, but it can't be the same place as professional Creationists. The big bang theory may not be the last word from science on cosmology, by I can't see a no-good, talentless hack like Hovind, or any other professional Creationist crank, providing us with any insights into it.
1	Then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? Silly, I 'd say! Humans are part of the animal kingdom. Mammals if I remember from biology. Are you not an animal? If not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon.	For me the reason I don't "give it credit" is that it's irrelevant--I don't see how it matter either way way if sexual "orientation" is natural or not. It's a separate issue from the moral one.Remember, it's natural for animals to do many things--some species' males impregnate the females and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it's own. But just because such behavior exists among animals doesn't make it moral in humans. In fact I'd call it immoral. There are many such examples in the animal kingdom.Natural doesn't mean it's automatically moral.

0	And just how are the criminals and terroists to be kept from entering a school while armed? Airplanes, probably with some of the new technology, but schools, or bars, or post offices, or government buildings? Just a law that says it is illegal, surely is not going to work. emoticonXDonno	The only gun control laws that I really support are the laws stating that you may not carry a gun in certain places. While yes, this may affect law abiding citizens by not allowing them to carry their guns with them, criminals and terrorists are not allowed to carry them either. It is not meant to take your rights away, it is meant to prevent guns from being introduced into areas where they are deamed to be dangerous and innapropriate, ie schools and airplanes.

0	Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?	Hi SS. Causing trouble again? :)The cat experiment you describe cannot, unfortunately, be used to support Lamarckian inheritance, because all the animals were denied the same essential nutrients, both the parents and the developing cats in the womb. Logically, if lack of nourishment causes health problems in one generation it's inevitably going to cause the same problems in the next even without any evolution taking place. As others have pointed out, this experiment is evidence that adaptation to that restricted diet was not happening. Had the cats initially suffered and then begun to get better, this would be strong evidence that adaptation was occurring.Similarly, if you were denied Vitamin C you would develop scurvy. If a pregnant woman was denied Vitamin C - well, it hardly bears thinking about, but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it, too, was denied Vitamin C.Now, if the baby was born with a functional Vitamin C synthesising gene, that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes.

1	It is supported, I have shown that it is true. Your only argument is to claim that organisations that perpetrate genocide don't agree that it is genocide. Wow what an argument you have.	In the quote which you referenced, the bottom line was "The point at which we assign rights IS a matter of opinion." That is part of what we are debating in the abortion debate.However, unlike the term person or the ideas about when rights begin, the term genocide is NOT a matter of opinion and it DOES have a very specific DEFINITIVE meaning, as defined in the definitions posted over the last few pages. I say that your claim of abortion being genocide is untrue and unsupported by logical arguement. It does not match that definition. You are the one who are spouting the importance of being definitive, yet the only support that you have given is gross distortions of the actual definition.

1	do you go to study hall? probably not. It is a requirement where the athletes sign in and sit in the library with their teams and are monitored to make sure that their studying is getting done.	So you can tell me the athletes that were brought into the school to specificially play sports are going to abide by all the rules as well as the students that attend the school at their free will also, are going to spend 15 hours a week studying? I don't think so. Its more of a lesure activity than a serious requirement.
1	When do you advocate breeding blond haired, blue eyed citizens to purify the US?	It's not just in case of an emergency. It's for everyday life. When I have to learn Spanish just to order a burger at the local Micky Dee's, that's a problem. Or when I'm trying to get some help at Wally World. So yes, I think that we need to establish a national language. "Should an English speaker learn to speak Spanish if they're going to Miami, LA or or other city where 99% of the language spoken is Spanish?"No, because LA is in California, which is in the US, and most of the US speaks English.
0	Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.(Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)	I suppose the correct terminology would be that G. fortis evolved a smaller beak due to competition from a larger billed recent imigrant.I suppose that we just aren't subjected to the same word selection pressures this side of the Atlantic.emoticonXHoho
1	So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.	I believed and hoped in the possibility. It was Jesus, the living son of God.. he had feet, hands, legs - he had a body yes. I never looked at his face, but i knew who it was - for one thing nobody walks around in robes anywhere near where I live. I could also see the marks on his feet when I got up close... My friends who were with me did not see him, but I am not suprised they were engrossed in their conversation, I left their side and they did not realise I had left.
0	You know that, I know that, but the creationists do not know that.	Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.

0	The difference of 43 deaths a year is the 4th largest flucuation since 1990 - not what you call insignificant. Would this difference be made if more guns did equal more crime?	40 less people dying a year is pretty good news - but I don't think you can attribute it to the change in gun law. If you plot the table of homicides, you get a pretty steady negative correlation which has been declining ever since 1991. 2009 hasn't been a particularly spectacular decline compared to previous years.
1	sorry your mightiness, thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk.  are you really that obtuse? i swear you and easy share a brain. i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority. personally, i think this applies to single parents, families with 2 daddies, or children raised in an orphanage.  yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children, they are taught some form of respect for authority.  how so? i didn't write it, i'm just commenting on it. and again, i prefer to replace 'mother and father' with authority. regardless, who says respect = fear? maybe you and easy really do share a brain...you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments.	this doesnt really add up to anything more than your musings so i will take up one point. respect for your mother and father is only relevant in a society where the nuclear family is the norm. there have been some societies where this was not the norm. im afraid to say this demonstrates another example of someone that believes the world is and always was as he lives it . respect( or fear) is necessary for a functioning society but not necessarily towards parents..which is exactly what the commandment orders.

0	Actually, that's not true. While all of the sciences actually support one another, one can be a chemist and not accept evolution. One can even do good science without accepting evolution, but it is difficult. For example, cosmology, astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe. That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution.	If somebody is not an evolutionist to you he/she is not "really" ascientist is he?
0	okay, my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion; but, here is my opinion anyway. one reason there are so many crimes against women, or crimes in general, is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time. how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses. i don't know what the answer is --but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes, especially sex crimes.	i have had to really change my point of view of how people (male and female) look at life lately, greg. although i can see your pov, i also see a growing defeatist attitude, at least area-wide here. that is one reason i changed my custom user title, which means: life happens live with it. why the despairing attitude? hopelessness, i thinkwhere that comes from i have no idea.

You should see some of the other "books" he has at his site as well.Well, now we know that Muslim creationists are even nuttier than Christian creationists, but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo-science of creationism (Read: Religious beliefs). ;)	Ugh, the stupidity. I read the first chapter, here's some good excerpts.It's helpful if one understands evolution before one attempts to debunk it.That's just a blatant lie. The vast majority of mutations are actually neutral.One word: archaeopteryx.
0	And here we have a leading YEC showing how he starts with his preexisting religious position and is not about to change it, no matter what the scientific evidences show.	”By creation we mean the bringing into being by a supernatural Creator of the basic kinds of plants and animals by the process of sudden, or fiat, creation. We do not know how the Creator created, what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe. This is why we refer to creation as special creation. We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative process used by the Creator.”(italics in original, Duane Gish, Evolution? The Fossils Say No!, 1978, p42)

0	I think perhaps you're confused.1. I know of no meaningful definion of the term "god' as it pertains to reality.2.

0	Ok, now I'd like to know why Lappster thinks evolution has anything to do with morality? Do you actually know what evolution is Lappster?	I find it interesting that the stars create the clouds and inturn the clouds form into stars. One vicious cycle with no begining. In a forum devoted to origin you offer the explainiation of no origin at all but rather meaningless existence. This is the main problem I have with evolution and it's application to physical sciences. A cycle with no begining has indeed no forseeable end. Therefore on a personal level I have no hope of changing anything. Things were, are and will continue to be this cycle of events. As this applies to biology any other life sciences. My actions are only the result of my animal instict. I am not playing the inner - child but rather the inner - beast. No law is passed to keep a beast in submission to another beast. Governing bodies fail if there is no accountablity. That is the cruix of the discussion. I am accoutable to God. If I am wrong about creation, I have only missed out on a lifetime of animal behavior. If you are wrong about evolution, then I fear you are far the worse off then I.

Locked door sounds good to me.Are we assuming that the hijacker also has a gun? Or would otherwise it result in a duel with plastic forks and the purple thing left over from lunch?Trouble is this question leads to the next one- would you prefer to possibly have a passanger with a gun, a the hijacker almost certainly with one. Or neither having a gun?

0	Well said. Most Americans favor more gun control, but unfortunately this majority of Americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue. This is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control. There probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but I'm not sure how much this will change things.	The reason the dems wimp out is because the gun nuts votes are likely to be swayed by a candidate's position on gun control, whereas non gun nuts, while having an opinion, are most likely concerned about other issues. It is the same reason people don't tend to come out loudly pro-choice, even though the majority of the US population are pro-choice.

Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference. Injustice is still practiced there, and not even some abortion doctors realize it.	That is an incorrect statement. Viability seems to be the topic that gets little mention here.

The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the "mitochondrial Eve" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies.	Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial "Eve", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.

1	Well, if history were binding we would still have slavery...and abortions being illegal for that matter. Something being done for a long time doesn't mean it makes it in the constitution. I don't know which part of the constitution has a "preserve history" clause.	I said considering the history of the issue. Marriage in America and in the modern British tradition, and in the modern Western tradition IS a fundamental right of free people and has been so for hundreds of years. If a state tried to overturn that system by banning marriage OR EVEN BY REFUSING to acknowledge and provide for civil marriage, I don't think it would be allowed.
0	But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on.	Fire and tool use means that having a big brain becomes less of a disadvantage and more of an advantage now that you can feed it yea but you have to have the brains to build a fire before it becomes an advantage. sigh.

If it behaves in such a way as to maximise profit, like its private sector alternatives, what possible purpose does it serve? It's either     a) Pointless. Why don't we also have a "public option" pizza restaurant chain and a "public option" door to door
0	And my interpretation of my writing is that I didn't mean that. Who has more authority?	His opponents were not overlooking "most likely". Instead, they were taking "most likely" to the extreme and saying "this is what it actually is". You do the same thing with your dead animal and car vs alien. While you say "most likely", what you really mean is that the alien hypothesis is wrong.
0	as we've seen in recent years, kids who are bullied can become so anti-social that they become violent, and attack those who've bullied them with weapons and mass murders. i'm not condoning this behavior, but i'm not surprised that it happens. those who support the bullying of gay kids and others...well, you get what you sow.	characters like our jyosh just want to diminish gays in society, and deny that gays are victims of religious homophobia. this is why he pretends that bullying of gay kids is just a feature of bullying in general (as if blue-eyed kids were routinely bullied because of their eye colour!), rather than a direct consequence of religious bigotry. he can't bring himself to admit the truth there.
0	I think you got it backwards Kelvin. You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.   And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow.	in great britain the police have been arresting children for playing with toy guns. natalie and darren, both 12, were arrested for playing with a toy gun. the uk police fingerprinted them and then threw them in a jail cell. http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/uk...00/2198387.stm  in us airports similar things are happening. “security officers at los angeles airport have confiscated a gun in a security scare - from a plastic toy soldier. the two-inch weapon belonged to a gi joe toy - similar to an action man.” http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0...070123,00.html

0	The man seemed have a thing about prostitutes. I believe he felt it was his God-given destiny to punish them.Cybererratus is a very interesting persona. He manifests a number of very interesting character traits. I don't believe that he likes women very much. In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling.	Later in a statement Ridgway said that murdering young women was his "career".

0	So what is your point? Are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views? Science proceeds by challenges and contradictions. Contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance. In religion, it is without question, a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth. Which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth?	Sounds contradictory to me!

0	It's not a literal account unless you interpret it that way.	How can you say such things? The Bible says that God CREATED over and OVER and OVER again! And you reject that and say that everything came about by evolution? If you reject the literal account of the Creation in Genesis, you are saying that God is a liar! If you cannot trust God's Word from the first verse, how can you know that the rest of it can be trusted?
0	winston dearie you really shouldn't make such general accusations, that can get you into trouble. point them out if you can. the shooting in norway, columbine, virginia tech, the tulsa shootings and the tuscon assassination attempt weren't carried out by people a normal person could consider decent and respectable in nature and they were all massacres. you might kill somebody too. you might kill a lot of somebodies for no reason. should you be legislated against and restrained?	until one or more of them starts shooting emoticonxkill all gun massacres were committed by 'decent and respectable people', who then became former decent and respectable people. one day doc may start shooting (he is already metaphorically sending simone to the ovens, which shows what a sicko he is) , who knows ??

0	I'm not moving the goal posts, this is just your attempt at intellectual dishonesty. Heller was about an individual right protected in the Constitution, Dred Scott wasn't. Therefore these two cases aren't comparable anymore than cotton candy and scrap metal.	Stop moving the goal posts. My point was that the Supreme Court has been wrong before so assuming that the Supreme Court is always correct about an issue is unjustified.

1	Because their reasoning is obviously on the same level as their reading comprehension level.	Well, as we can see from other recent posts, your reading comprehension is below high school level.I don't get it. Why do folks think lying enhances their POV?
0	This is not true. Rather, when there is conflict between one's sanctity of life vs another's quality of life, the sanctity of life must win.	In affirming the absolute sanctity of life, we deny the sanctity of particular lives by putting them at the disposal of others - in the case of abortion, affirming the absolute sanctity of the baby's life involuntarily subordinates the mother to the child.
1	Thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like KFC to me.	What I marvel at is that you're not even embarrassed to ask such an ignorant question. Because if it's a chicken egg, and if it's allowed to incubate to term, it sure isn't going to be a crow when it hatches. And to be even more simplistic, a chicken egg is still a chicken while it's in the egg. Just as a human being is still a human being in the womb.
0	I think hip hop and the arts are reflections of society. It is good to bring these issues to light, if only so that those who wouldn't normally be aware of them are enlightened.	Ludacris and many others in the hip hop scene disrespect women with their lyrics and videos. Much of what hip hop puts out contributes to unwanted pregnancies.

0	well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice.	i can see your point, though i am confused about gay sex drive, your saying a gay man's sex drive is not feminine? is it reasonable for a heterosexual to want to avoid close contact with a homosexual under certain conditions? like being naked for example? there are gays that go to my gym, am i being homophobic if i purposely avoid showering with him? i can surely pick my friends; naturally my interests would hardly mirror a homosexuals interests. some are even quite feminine and would hardly be interested in the same subjects as me. is it reasonable for me to be selective about whom my friends can be?

0	Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it.	"Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all have many guns (though not nearly as many handguns as does the United States). The key difference is that these countries do a much better job than we do of keeping guns out of the wrong hands. Their experience shows that when there are reasonable restrictions, relatively few outlaws can possess or use guns. " -http://www.vahv.org/NEJM-ed.html I am 100% in favor of outlaws not having guns. If you have not noticed, 3 groups of people can not have guns in this country.1) The insane2) Criminals3) Domestic violence perpsIt is currently illegal for outlaws to have guns. Passing another law will just make outlaws "double-lly" illegal. NO MORE LAWS are need. ENFORCEMENT of current laws is what is needed.If law #1 is not enforced, what makes you think law #2 will be enforced?
0	you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india.	i said a few posts up that i don't think that people are actually offended. it's strictly a seperation of church and state issue. incorrect. check out my post above from 7-19 to see the legal issues. in particular, the government may not take any action whos primary effect is to advance or endorse religion and 'the constitution forbids not only state practices that 'aid one religion...or prefer one religion over another,' but also those practices that 'aid all religions' and thus endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion'.
0	They can "marry" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.	So what rational reason would there be to deny them the right to marry the person they love?
0	Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram. I think that you'll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much.	Why, if one wants to have an abortion, should one be FORCED to view a sonogram?

1	This should be in the science section, not the CvE section. Don't give SS any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology.	I just read an article in Discovery magazine about smashing two protons together, going near the speed of light, inside of a huge, two mile ring. The proton breaks into Quarks and Gluans. This experiment is being used to understand what happened when the big bang went bang. I think they're trying to understand how the protons formed the matter in the big bang. I didn't read the whole article, but let me try to find it.It would be interesting to see what happens. I've always been fascinated with the big bang, and we may finally start to understand much more about it and how it happened.Thoughts?
0	Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates. It's my personal favourite - but what do you think?	This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist. S
0	They do not. They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible. Feathers also offer increased protection from attack. They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers. They absorb and spread impact quite well.Feathers don't itch and they don't rustle in the bush.Do you have an answers that aren't examples of shallow thinking?	1)Reptile develops feathers. They offer reduced protection. They itch. Rustle in the bush. Feathers devolve.
1	Unriggable, your statement should read the so-called "pro-life" since they are anything but.	So they (pro-life peeps) say abortion is murder. Of course, you can only murder people. So their rule is that fetuses (feti?) are people also. But then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the US Census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage. Pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.Or am I missing something? Care to clarify, anybody who disagrees?
0	we are not talking about genesis as a story are we? we are talking about bilbical creation. you really are thick arent you? i know there are religious people, deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread. undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it. certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved. the horse evolution thread was fine...you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. now show exactly how life originated and you're home and dry.	woopiee... i would have to say that you are putting yourself deeper and deeper into the ccoi every post you are making. you see, this is talking about 'biblical creation'... you know, taking genesis literally, and all that type of nonsense. there are many deeply religious christians that have no problem in accepting that genesis is a story, and not historically accurate. it takes someone profoundly stupid and ignorant to pull that stuff out of their rear. and like i said, 'undisputable' is totally stupid.. because even if the evidence is 100 percent positive, you have xxxxxx that will dispute it.  i mean, this link has undisputable evidence of horse evolution, yet you will dispute it anyway horse evolution over 55 million years

0	And evolution is exhausted. It can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more.	True, but it does make evolution a known factor, and the scientific method requires that one prioritise exhausting the explicative power of known factors before inventing new ones.

0	But the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself. Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying'God must exist, because God is good and would not allow a world without God'.	All the knowledge from Science has come from trusting mutual experience. It has gotten us far and will continue to (as long as we don't destroy ourselves in misusing that knowledge).
0	what do you find disrespectful about it? maybe it is 'disrespectful' but i sometimes that's not necessarily so bad. i don't think it rises to the level of being offensive.	i think you may be taking our objections a bit too seriously. what he said was stupid and homophobic, sure. but i have no idea who this guy is or how big an audience, if any, he has. if i thought he had the country's ear, if he was running for office, if he set policy; then i'd be concerned. as it is, i'm quite content to just point out what an idiot he seems to be.  and i'm curious. you don't actually think that anyone who supports gay rights in any way could find that piece anything but disrespectful, do you? granted, he may not be worth worrying about, but he clearly has no respect for gays at all.

0	Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results.	Indeed, for several decades, molecular evolutionists have relied on an evolutionary view that abandons the Darwinian presumption of abundant pre-existing variation, assuming instead that the rate of evolution depends directly on the rate of introduction of new alleles by mutation.
1	No, they don't. Creationists do. "Why haven't all animals turned into humans?"	Evolutionists may talk of actual selection as if it had a mind of its own and does the work of evolution on purpose
0	You could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out.	Assuming this right exists....you could say that you have no right to kill it though, you can only try to starve it.-You have consented sex and get pregnant. The pregnancy is a direct consequence that was known when having sex.-You have consented to a stranger coming into your house to eat dinner. The stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner. -If you say you don't want the unborn to "live off you" anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now.-You have decided the stranger must go, however, you don't have a right to kill him right there as you didn't give him any reasonable time to leave.
1	Pure conjecture on your part. As a father of three, I have as much vested interest in my kids as my wife has. To suggest otherwise is BS. But, maybe you don't understand that because you haven't walked a mile in a father's shoes. emoticonXRolleyes	Of course men can, do, and should have opinions and feelings about abortion, but to say that your interest is equal to that as a woman is silly. Men will never be pregnant, regardless of what laws stand, they impact men very little in any real way.

Quick, club the lot of them before this thing spreads.emoticonXRolleyes   Er . . . *puts down burning cross and slinks into shadow*	MRSA has been around a long time, and as a practicing Navy physician I have seen outbreaks in millitary populations for years. A 2005 study by the Navy Environmental Health Center that did not make any headlines showed that community acquired MRSA was present in 3-5 % of Navy recruits. There have been significant outbreaks in the SEAL training school in San Diego, as well as the Marine Recruit Training Depot, but this has not made the news. MRSA has also been a problem for years in hospitals and nursing homes. Now that someone has found a community outbreak in a gay population, it's "big" news ... bullsh!t.

1	Hey Dane, you're real good at calling people ignorant, sanctimoniously declaring everything they say as false, blatantly false, or falsehoods. But would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts arguments with anything more than insults? Like some actual facts for example?	It has moved on to The Scientific Theory of Evolution.Hmm, so given this exhibition of ignorance of what Evolution is, you are saying that because you never heard of mutations, Evolution doesn't work? That's a problem with your ignorance, not with the Scientific Theory of Evolution.It changes ratios of gene alleles in a population., which certainly fits the definition of Evolution (Namely, "the changes in alleles in a population over generational time)."RM&NS"????But then, there also is absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence.False.Quite. But then neither does many living systems. Unless you deliberately engage in revisionist linguistic hyperbole to change the definition of "purposefully" or "intelligently," your argument is outright false.Blatantly false.Blatantly false.Blatantly false.What is this? Some kind of "I'll will make a false presentation of living entities and use this falsehood to disprove Evolution" ####? If your argument is based on outright falsehoods like you just did, then the output will be false as well. Remember the old computer programmer term - "garbage in, garbage out."
0	how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act? i don't see what you're getting at.	diogenes raises a good point, and this applies to all aspects of national security as well. during the clinton administration, reno's justice department and tennet's cia treated terrorism as a criminal act, which it is not. a war does not have to be between countries to be a war.

0	I think your idea has merit. However, before I would fully endorse it, I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law.	The thing is, though, that if marriage is privatized people can have freedom without "redefining the standard." It is a way for us to allow all those oddball marriages without putting an "official stamp of approval" on them. Liberals want to expand the government involvement in marriage to include gay marriages, thus putting society's approval on these things (something that gets moralists very angry.)Conservatives want to continue the statist rewards for straight marriage only - a violation of the 14th amendment.Libertarians combine the best of both positions. Their position (privatization) creates the freedom to marry, upholds the Constitution, and avoids official approval of gay marriage at the same time.

0	But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the "logical" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and "make sense" to more than one person, these specific "explanations" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.	Look around. Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air. It is obviously part of our psyche. Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith. Even on different sides of the planet.It's as natural as the sun rising.
1	yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?	while you see the need to not only debate him on points, then post an expose about your ideas of his capability, i'm still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology. how does the phrase 'survival of the fittest' change in any way, what evolution is, the evidence that supports it, and the fact that there simply is no strong evidence for any other mechanism by which humans have come to be, on earth? i ask because i assume you must think there is some relevance to the discussion of creation vs evolution. there might not be, that's ok too, i'd just like to make sure we don't put words in your mouth. -mach

1	You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:Question: Was Stalin a communist ?Answer: That's what he said he was.Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.	So Stalin didn't actually practice Communism (not that anyone has), but really just used bits and pieces to further his rule and such ideology is not communism but Stalinism. So in essence, Stalin wasn't a commie.
1	pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ? your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.My advice to you ?keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.	One needs not be ancient to know more than those around them. My age is irrelevant to the fact that I simply know more than you can comprehend. Because unlike others I'm observant and actually pay attention.
1	What, pray, is a real answer? Because, you know, if it is anything like a corrcect answer you are doing a rather poor job of it, mate.

0	BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry. Any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed.	They can "marry" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.
0	Well let's deal with one thing at a time. The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. The study didn't conclude that it was just a "curious relationship in the numbers." Go back to that thread and read the study. If you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. You can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.	From my memory your medical references both showed the trend you state, but they were also limited in geography and sample (two cities), and provided no casue and effect, merely a curious relationship in the numbers.

1	Numbers don't lie, unless they come out of the mouth of a Politican.	SS and Medicare (which funds Medicaid) are off-budget items and funded trusts. SS administration is budget item, peanuts.

0	if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. based on results paul had more influence. how can you simply ignore the obvious? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it's unwillingness to concede that sometimes it's wrong. how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn't flat.  instead they either ignore the issue, bury it through violence or intimidation, or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right.	peter was obviously there are more writings of peter apart from the gospel of mark and 1 & 2 peter you find in the bible.... you will discover it is not only the bible that the church use for their deposit of faith but a number of other writings regarded as sacred tradition. it was peter and the apostles who had influence over paul not vice versa. if peter and the apostles influenced paul and peter had primacy among the apostles obviously it was peter who influenced the church not paul, since paul was influenced by peter!

0	Well let's put it this way. I really like playing baseball. So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they're in a position where it will threaten their life. Since it's such a wonderful thing no one should have any problem with a law passed, right?	You missed the point of the question. I'm not talking about 'rights' or legal issues. I'm wondering why pro-choice people often portray pregnancy as a horrible thing in their arguments. Period.
0	do you have any evidence of this that doean't come from a biased christian website? so here is where you are saying nanny, nannie, poo,poo my straight realtionship is better than your gay relationship. how? some big claims, can you provide some substance to them, in other words can you back this up with some data? that doesn't come from some christian baised study.	the legalization of same-sex marriages (or marriage-like civil unions or domestic partnerships) would severely damage the public institution of marriage. it would send a false message that same-sex unions are equivalent to marriage, that same-sex relations and marriage contribute equally to society and provide equal potential for individual and social integrity, stability and happiness. it would convey the false message that whatever private sexual relationships adults choose deserve the same legal treatment as traditional marriages. legalizing same-sex marriage would create enormous conflict and confusion in the law and among legal systems.

We have reminants of all types of systems including socialism. In the modern world I don't think a society as large as the US is could be run under just one pure system.	Socialism, communism and capitalism aren't the only choices for how to organize an economy.Also, the US at present is neither "pure capitalist" nor socialist. I do believe that some people should re-evaluate their definitions of socialism, as they seem confused about what it is.
0	I think a more telling question would be, why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe? It seems completely idiotic to me.   Smiley	omegamon_x said something in another thread that that raised some questions in my mind: mainly: why? specifically, why worry about the threat of potential harm from criminals? statistically, the risk of such is relatively low compared to, say,  the leading killer in the developed world. you face a much greater threat of potential harm from that than at the hands of a criminal. are you as adamant about eating healthy as you are about the need to have a gun? the fact is, we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day. risk is a part of living. i would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime, when other methods (better locks, alarms, non-lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers) can be effective.
1	Abstinence until heterosexual marriage isn't encouraging heterosexual marriage?  I've never heard of an abstinence-until-domestic-partnership program. Perhaps you could point us to an inclusive abstinence-only program somewhere.  Perhaps not....	abstinence programs and gay rights are two quite separate issues. no one is trying to enact any law in this country to make it illegal to have sex before marriage. regardless, there's no way anyone can argue that abstinence programs are about 'straight pride' or somehow about being straight, which was the context of the discussion when these examples came up.
1	they weren't interested, remember? so your god punishes children for not being a member of the right 'club'. your god sounds more and more like a monster every time you mention him. once again, like with archie i have been wrong to assume you a bigot, you're a xenophobe.	a person doesn't have to be perfect to lead a boy into the truth of the salvation of jesus christ. and if jito's gay friend is teaching the kid that gay sex is fine and is failing to lead the boy into the truth about jesus christ, then imo he isn't a positive role model.

1	And if the majority supported banning Christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? Civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.	When placed on the ballot instead of being rammed down the public's throats by activist courts and out-of-touch legislators, gay marriage has a ZERO - 31 record. The fact is that the public, when it exercises its Constitutional Right to decide via the ballot box, has decided against gay marriage EVERY TIME.Gays can't blame the Christian Right and the Mormons for spending $Millions on this one. In fact, gays spent a ton on this one....and it didn't matter.

0	Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.	Athiesim has no such standard, and I don't want to hear about relative "ethics" that mean nothing, or have no longevity, or change with the winds.

0	i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp	the fact is that these countries supplied trained terrorists that hijacked the planes that were used in the 9/11 attacks. the fact is that these countries are hosts of al qaeda training camps your 'proof' that iraq deserves or military onslaught is a jordanian terrorist named zarqawi operating out of iraq. he was a terrorist in jordan before he moved to iraq, and there are still numerous al qaeda training camps in jordan that we have not addressed anyway, you have been asked to show that iraq has a single al qaeda terrorist camp which is protected or acquiesed by iraq

There was no immediate response from the United States to Erakat's claims. Soon after Abbas' capture, U.S. officials said U.S. indictments of Abbas for piracy, hostage-taking and conspiracy have apparently expired, although they could be renewed.

1	But that is how creationism works - half truth. Evolution is a theory but don't make it quite clear that in science the word theory doesn't mean half-assed guess, as it does in creationism. Check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the Patterns of Cumulative Change paragraph on page 7. That is pure YEC. And you aren't a YEC?	All they are really pressing for is basically for kids parents to tell their kids AT HOME that god guided evolution without it contrasting directly with what the kids are being taught at school. Personally, I see no problem with this, as long as they stick to the facts in any case. Just glanmcing over the proposed changes, I am not seeing anything that is factually incorrect.

An argument made for slavery was that "you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do"..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned.	First of all, i can turn around right here, because i can see that you already have no idea what you are talking about. Pro-choicers do not advocate the abortion of fetuses. Anti-choice antics are getting pretty dirty these days.
0	you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them.	do you think that english is in some way uniquely suited to the pursuit of science? there is a pretty long history of science in india. i'm not an expert on pre-colonial india but i'm pretty certain it was not the primitive land you seem to think it was. western science could have been obtained by other sources than colonisation. japan is an alternative example of how trade with the west might have occured.
1	I'm against polygamy, marriages with underaged minors and marriages to livestock as well, so don't feel that you are the only ones not "accomodated".	You are against it for reasons of your personal religious beliefs, because marriage is a "sacrament".

However, it is gays that shouldn't be accomodated?

Sure "we" can study our origins and move into the future at the same time. "We" always have. There are professionel theologins and archeologists whom I would consider to actually make up the "we"
0	any evidence for said 'abandonment'? also, the thing most likely to secure a lasting peace in israel-palestine is for the us to stop subsidising the oppression of the palestinian people. in any case, i thought we were talking about abm systems, i'm not aware of israel having such a system.	do you consider the patriot system a missile defense system? did it not work on occasion for israel? does obama's intent to abandon israel mean anything to you?

Shall I remind you of the humorous story about the "image of Jesus" that attracted much attention, yet turned out to be a coincidence of shadows? This is why I insist upon your defining the terms you're using.	You have fallen into the same trap as the IDers. When we say "designed" there is an unspoken prepositional phrase -- "by an intelligent entity". What is really meant by "designed" -- in both Paley and IDers -- is that plants and animals are manufactured. Just like the watch was manufactured.
0	382 - 405 are the dates I have, under Pope Damasus I.	Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts, and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament, certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century. I don't whether it is "generally accepted" that the text was altered, it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general.
0	That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench.	For example, Scalia stated in Heller:"Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."
1	So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?	Biology is centered around the theory of evolution. Without it, biology is hardly biology.
0	I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.	NOTE: When I say beneficial mutations, I am not talking about a gain of new genetic information to the genome.
0	no, darling....i'm a religiously 'lax', but 'spiritually active' episcopalian. but, what if i was a believer in the nation of islam? would that justify your bigotry and racism? i think not. check the 1st amendment, which you conveniently omit.	you're an idiot that believes the guff spouted from the nation of islam.
0	Because....expansion occurs after heat is added. How can a expansion occur with a prior cause? You're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time. Show me an example that does that.	Actually, the heating and the expanding would have had to happen at the same time.

0	I have heard that the USA spends around 40% (total) more on health care than Canada does. That would be impressive if it weren't for one fact. The USA has 900% of our population. It is your administration costs what are getting you the most. We only spend around 11% on administration while the USA spends around 25% of their health care dollars. We have a cap on how much a doctor can be sued for as well. Yes, our system isn't perfect, but it still works.Nearly 50 million Americans don't have health care at all, that is around 18% of your total population. This is quite shameful. As I've stated, the USA is the only Nation in the Industrialize world to not have universal health care.	Is that worth it? I don't think so. I have my own idea for a healthcare plan... it's not at all universal, but it helps the people who need help without subjecting people to substandard care.
1	I know. Sad indeed. Orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas. As if Jesus (who is God according to Scripture) would come out and give Moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man. Get real. When the antichrist comes he'll probably be gay (one OT scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women, and Satan loves to mimic God's kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist.). Then Orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior.	First he (Orion) starts with a comedy website, but then he actually gets on this thread and starts asking questions positing "what if" Jesus was Gay?

1	only you would consider accepting donations equivalent to charging a fee moose. as if the two are at all similar. after all, one is a mandatory charge, while the other is an optional donation.  and i'm not going to defend the rapture at all, but don't you think it's a bit premature to assume it will never happen?	they accept donations, however. if these donations exceed the cost of hosting a website (pretty inexpensive), where does the money go?

If you mean simply change over time, then I guess I'm an evolutionist. I do however, believe the world was created rather recently.
1	Dude, my own father had hospice care in my home up until he died. I think I know a thing or two about it. None of what you say disproves that end-of-life can still be a scary thing. Maybe if you'd stop just being belligerent about it and actually thoughtfully discuss it, you might actually find some things I'm saying you find agreeable. (GASP!)	Most people do have this peculiar preference of comfort over suffering. It's called a respect and appreciation for how precious life is. Do they have hospice care where you live?
1	That's quite a leap, even for you. How did you know that the officiers were pro-life? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance.   I certainly think it was excessive. I guess I must not be pro-life by your illogic.	Anti-choicers don't give two whits about life, or really believe in the absolute value of a fetus. This story is a good example of that. I bet a lot of so-called "pro-lifers" would support this court's decision, even though the mother posed no real threat, and she could have miscarried the fetus:For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all.

0	And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences.	HeheI can't tell a difference between my philosophy and science, it is all knowledge that is gained through non-contradictory inquiry into reality.
0	See above. Give kids credit. You give them a bogus answer and they will know. We have got to stop treating sex like a dirty little secret.	Though just in the case of an accident where maybe an older sibling had carelessly left one lying around, it is understandable that mistakes happen. I would simply continue along with the "scaled down version" and say that it's something such as a "gasket for sealing off biological contaminants". Now a response like this would confuse a child and go way over his/her head, though an adult could get a chuckle out of it, knowing the inside joke..
0	That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it.	In a few decades, it might be possible that technological progress would develop an "artificial womb" that can nurture a fetus almost from day one until birth. How would that change the abortion debate?

1	are you telling me that my pubes are sentient? i agree, however i am no constitutional expert.	reading back through this thread, i realized that i must have missed this post. i'm glad you posted it because although the post is ridiculous, it nevertheless has comedic value. can the government tell someone that they cannot beat their children, even if they choose to beat them only in the privacy of their own home? and further than that, it is an obvious fact that just because something should be in the constitution does not mean it actually is in the constitution.
0	Please define "climb upward" and "downhill slide" in biologically meaningful terms. Please define "degeneration."	Some evolutionists try to claim that life can indeed climb upward by saying that the organism can draw energy from its environment – which would enable it to defy the downhill slide of degneration [sic].
0	And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks, and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property.

0	falling, did i say that 'the church alone provides for the needy?' if i did please point it out to me. each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the federal government. the constitution gives certain delegated powers to the federal government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. socialism is merely the stepping stone into communism, and i don't want to see this nation start down that path. maybe i live by the constitution because it is 'the supreme law of the land.' the question is not why do i live by the constitution, but why don't you? until the constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and i plan to live by it.	here is a thread where we can go at each others throats, so-to-speak. which is the better ecnomic system: capitalism or socialism?

0	Depends on which cell you mean. Mammalian red blood cells, for example, have had their entire nuclei and mitochondria removed.

0	your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.	which is why it should be done on a case-by-case basis. sometimes there can be an age gap of 5 years and it could still be consensual, so imo fine, but other times it could be 4 years age difference and not fine (eg, a 14 year old and a ten year old) i'm not really sure how that analogy is relevant. -wez
0	It is clear that the profetallifers wish to make the pregnant woman a slave to her fetus.	OK, I'll play.Assuming a fetus is a person, it depends on the body and organs of the host to live. It will put the host's body through stress and discomfort for months, possibly even cause it to die, at the very least it will change that body forever.No person can be compelled to give organs, tissue, or blood against their will, even to save the life of another. This is SO fundamental that not even condemned prisoners can be so compelled. Forcing a woman to use her organs to support another person is the same thing and should be forbidden the same way.

They could technically be tried in U.S. federal court for offenses committed in Iraq, but logistically that would be very difficult and the Justice Department has shown no interest in prosecuting Jones's case, meaning her assailants almost certainly won't face any criminal penalties.Why Jamie Leigh Jones Can?t Take Halliburton to Court | Rights and Liberties | AlterNet

0	for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?	no only does the experiences one has make that person, but so does their effect on others. i didn't mean that only this and nothing else define a human being, i just used this on thing to justify abortion. this is an odd question, i mean, i can see myself saving someone's life if my stakes were relativly low, but to kill myself completely to save someone i don't know? i don't think so. would you, because i doubt it. of course they do.
0	Evolution doesn't explain the event. The event is an example of evolution - a change in the frequency of alleles in a populatioin over time. The explanation may or may not be evolution by natural selection. You merely asserted that based on your imagined case.	Evolution is not needed to explain such an event, as natural selection clearly accounts for it.
1	Not only is Phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality. You were already called on using incorrect facts once...you might as well say "denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day"	I agree with you.Do I want abortion to used for birth control? no...As you say, I agree things need to be looked at on a case by case bases; thats what choice is unless there are criteria. But again I agree, I can't set the criteria as well.You and I surely don't want the deaths back. Be it 10,000 or 80,000. Clearly we agree.Progress.
0	What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?	There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis.
0	i lived in sevilla for the better part of year. spaniards are extremely good at staying out of other people's business. smiling at a stranger on the bus is invasive. i am not surprised most spaniards support gay marriage - most likely because they would never assume it was any of their business.	spain is primarily a roman catholic country.......they will never let the socialists or the left allow gay marriage i nthat country........... you can take that to the bank
0	Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.	because you're right and they're wrong?
1	We came from apes not created. Why can't people figure that out did any body go to school around here.	In effect you are asking "To those of you who don't believe in Adam and Eve - what does Adam and Eve mean?" which is, a nonsense question to put forward.You might be trying to invoke debate from Christians who take a non-literal Biblical approach, if this is what you desire, you have not put the question properly.
0	And people say I make strawman arguments.Simply put, not enough to justify your "concerns".	And how many murderers have got away with it because they lured their victim to their home? And how many people have got away with killing someone just for trespassing.
1	so much bs... where should i start? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations. since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations? if a woman wants to maximize her life, liberty, and happiness, and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy, your intended prevention of that action 'flies in the face of the declaration of independence'... (not that the declaration has any legal standing.) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant. no thing, human or not, has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter's consent. 'abortive technologies'? you sound like falwell, insisting that cloning destroys life when it does nothing of the sort. please explain your laughable statement.	rovdak, are you forgetting that ivf and cloning technologies are abortive technologies?
0	based on what? i never said mr. horn did anything legally wrong. he was well within the rights of the state of texas. i never argued otherwise. that doesn't change the obvious fact that he intended to kill the two men, which is the topic of the discussion at hand.	i know more about human nature than you do. i'm beginning to not see much point in continuing this argument with you either, because you just can't seem to understand the fact that mr. horn wasn't found guilty of any wrongdoing. if you don't like it, take it up with the grand jury. maybe this is good publicity; don't come to texas if you have plans to be a criminal otherwise you'll get shot and the person you tried to rob will be hailed as a hero. that's the kind of message we need to be spreading; be a criminal and die like a dog.
1	you are attempting to trivialize the bias we who are gay, face, against our sexuality. you try to trivialize everything we have accomplished in terms of social acceptance, that heterosexuals have always taken for granted. your assinine comments show sensitivity to no one. maybe you'd like to start a pride movement for ignorant, insensitive, jackasses? society is moving so against that group right now.	unkerpaulie, you need to just accept that he's wired that way. if you fight it, he might spend his life in the closet and have inner turmoil! better yet, you should start a movement called thumbsucking pride! :p

The question doesn't get asked.If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question.	I don't discount that it happens, and do acknowledge that there are people out there that do that sort of thing. But I really do believe that it's the definite exception rather than the rule, and personal ideology shouldn't be made part of something like a job interview.
0	This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism.	Evolutionists have constructed the Geologic Column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of "primitive" life forms to "more complex" systems we observe today. Yet, since only a small percentage of the earth's surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column, the claim of their having taken place to form a period of rock--life--time over the earth is therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking.
0	does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy? probably not. would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos (threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries) help the economy? certainly not. is rawls argument correct, and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals? no.	at least with sport the best players are fairly easily identified, everyone can watch them in action and judge for themselves. with corporate officers it is much more ambiguous. there is no indication that firms are actually competing for the top talent, they just seem to be cycling around the same faces and awarding themselves ever larger pay rises.

0	so God would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom. how very libertarian of you, jyoshu.but actually, are evil and freedom inversely proportionate? look at the examples i gave: slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom. on top of that, God puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things... not to mention the evil that he himself has done. murder, genocide, bigotry... the lot.if he made people with complete freedom, he MUST have made people with evil as well. why did he do that? the only reason i can come up with is that if God made everyone in his image, he himself must be evil, even partially. that that is apparent in the bible.	I'd love to hear how some of these anti-theists would explain how to square wiping out all evil (decisions with negative consequences) while leaving people freedom of choice. You don't want to be mindless robot, eh? 'Course not. But don't blame God for all the evil in the world when you know one (evil) can't exist without the other (freedom).

I would love to see more discussion of views that are in between the two extremes of abortion illegal at all times, and abortion allowed at all times. My own view is between the two, closer to the pro-choice side.

I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. For both the 'braniac" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.	In short, I think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact: a person who is brain-dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given, whereas an embryo who is "brain-dead" most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone.
0	This is a very simple, easily answerable question. Most people, especially in America, have problems with people telling them what to do. Teenagers hate being under the authority of adults. Adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law. Everyone in the world is under worldly authority, but to actually have a God who created you, which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not, that makes most people really XXXXXX off.	Let me rephrase, what in the life of Jesus do you have a problem with? Not a problem in the practices of the church or the people, but in the being that we believe in. Which part do you have a problem with, or do you simply have a problem with the fact that is a "religion".

1	your foot would do service as a colander. in australia, a weapon may be legally held for many reasons. self defence is not one of them. you might legally own a weapon for sport shooting, but use it to defend yourself. how hard is that to understand? for a supposed 'expert' not to realise that a drawn pistol is not pointing at ones foot, is a major error commonly made by fantasy gunners.	did i just see a draw pistol and shoot ones self in foot here?

1	Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.	lmao! did you read my last sentence, the conclusion of my post? and i quote: "so to answer your question: yes"damn im so evasive!since you asked the question again, ill answer again<snip>stuff about us being in a democratic system</snip>as a christian, if a legal matter is being contested, and you want to oppose it, you are certainly welcome to do so. as a gay, if you want to propose a legal matter, a christian should be equally welcome to contest it. it is doing unto others as they would have others do unto them, so to answer your question: yes

0	And they could have experienced more without gun control. You're jumping to conclusions.	Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles.Whatever you read is irrelevant. In Heller the judges ruled it was illegal and unconstitutional to ban ownership of an entire class of firearms, such as handguns. In McDonald they extended that same standard to all 50 states. Gun control makes crime worse. Look at how many murders Chicago admitted they experienced each year that involved handguns. Nearly all of them.

Cuts off man's hand, lacerates his upper body, police sayBALTIMORE - A Johns Hopkins University student armed with a samurai sword killed a suspected burglar in a garage behind his off-campus home early Tuesday, hours after someone broke in and stole electronics.Some shocked neighbors said they heard bloodcurdling screams in an area just blocks from the university. Police held the student, a junior chemistry major who turns 21 on Sunday, for several hours, but no charges were filed by early afternoon, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

0	morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc).	the moral of that last story is: don't screw with baldy. that aside, where did god tell these folks to do what they did? just curious.

She noted that the Supreme Court, in District of Columbia v. Heller, ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to guns. But, she said, "We want them registered." Pelosi also used the word "draconian" to describe legislation before Congress to reform D.C.'s gun laws. Apparently referring to the provision of that legislation that would permit residents of D.C. to buy handguns in Maryland and Virginia, Pelosi added, "we don't want them crossing state lines." Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the Senate sponsor of the now-expired federal "assault weapons" ban, said on a CBS "60 Minutes" program to be aired on Sunday that she is only temporarily holding off on introducing legislation to reinstate the ban. "I'll pick the time and place. No question about it," Feinstein said.
1	Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd (people who support such laws as car registration) also own cars. More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white.	Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods.

0	Yeah, it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells, but I think that if it comes out the way they hope, it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks. I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists. And yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about, claiming it is immoral (maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonXRolleyes ), but it will likely not have as many objections.	I agree. Time will tell if the cells are as effective as embryonic stem cells, and it seems on the surface, they well might be.Except.These stem must be donated by pregnant women. Amniocentesis, while pretty darn safe, is not without risk.First, the pregnant mother must donate the cells.The risk to the fetus is not zero.When we already have a zero risk procedure from cells that are going to be disposed of anyway.In any event, I am sure some nut job with an extremely skewed sense of morality will find a way to call this procedure immoral in some way.

0	i really hope you're joking. extremism is a disease, but not religion. religion can be, and is, for the most part, peaceful.	of course it is known that wild animals that are sick just die from natural selection(they get eaten, or they don't manage to find food) and even livestock, if it has some disease, can be culled to prevent outbreak of disease. in humans it is different though, there are quarantine zones to prevent spread of certain disease. however, religion is sort of disease, but mind disease which can't be prevented to spread by some quarantine, but only by some great culling, and restricting it's spreading. religion is so embedded within (weak) human mind that it can't be removed normally(e.g. non violently, as those emotional weaklings would call it) but only by eradication.
1	i am surprised to hear you, a card-carrying christian, defending the civil rights of polygamists! wonders will never cease!  obviously the point flew right past your noggin. gay people are discriminated against because they are gay! but then, you folk think that's just fine. a few years ago, you'd have been blowing hard about 'activist' judges allowing interracial marriage. how dare they stand up for equal rights! emoticonxrolleyes	but they single out polygamists. this is a very disingenuous rebuttal of yours to steeeeve's point. it's like saying that we should just leave sodomy laws in place or state marriage amendments because the laws apply equally no matter what the race or creed of the gay people involved. obviously you're either completely missing steeeeve's point in using polygamists to analogize the issues here or intentionally avoiding it.

1	So how are those gun free zones working out for you?	"Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment , nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."-US Supreme Court in D.C. v. HellerSo the US Supreme court recognizes that some restrictions are reasonable such as not allowing felons to own guns or prohibiting people from carrying guns in school areas.
0	I know what you meant.My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply "vote" it out of existence. No need for the courts at all.	I meant a decision that the majority of the population has made in regards to legislation.

But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. I could very well be in prison myself.	i have had some experience with this topic... my father was murdered when i was 12, the perp was convicted a year later and was charged with 1st degree murder and sentenced to death.. flash forward 24 years he ran his course of appeals and every legal proceeding you can imagine. his lawyer after 20 years of him being on death row came up with 'retardation' mind you he 'walked' 3 times.. all of which i was there to witness. i was to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who has passed on. anyway at the last minute he got a stay of execution. back to the drawing table.. last year after several hearings, they came to the conclusion the he was mentally retarded..scoring a 75 on his iq test. the limit for the death penalty is 70. he was a high school graduate, had a family, held jobs.. and clearly competent, nonetheless they found him otherwise. so now he is off death row, and the da has told me that it is possible he could get parole eventually. with all that it has been a very trying time for me and i have had to struggle with how i really felt about the death penalty. i have been a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction. i do not know if it is out of revenge or not, hard to say i am too close to the matter. but i did feel let down when they took him off death row, now i feel like there will never be justice. i put so many years of waiting for that moment... it sounds kind of sick, but as much as i dreaded witnessing it, i also looked forward to it. i do think that maybe life in prison may be better, only if his experience there is just awful.... but the revenge side of me, just wants him to suffer what my father suffered. but if you were to ask me to think about this the old fashion way, which would be i should be the one to flip the switch .. not so sure i could do it. so with all that i still don't really know if i in my heart, support the death penalty or i am just after revenge. the victims of violence i would imagine go through this struggle. side note... the man who murdered my father also killed a young girl when he was a minor... he had escaped from the correctional facility he was in.. and it was several years later when he killed my dad.

1	You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death.	I thought I got to the substance of your argument quite well, and prefer not to drone on with a million quotes. If you want to press your argument further you will need to construct an argument as to why "putting someone in the position" obligates you to sustain their life, and when doing so you may want to examine the consequences of that position, to see if you can apply it consistently.You put it theretherefore you are responsible for itisn't, in itself, an argument.

Yes, because it's the right thing to do, and it is what our nation claims. Equal rights.However, I have nothing to say on the issue of the illegal, because a member in my family was recently attacked (stabbed) by one, and the wounds are too fresh, and if I speak on it, I will be speaking with prejudice, so I will leave that subject alone.But, what are your views?

0	Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion, as we all do. Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception. The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour. So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human' as and when it suits their purpose.Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like: some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human, then it IS. It isn't. It's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother. You can't deny that.Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue: in the meantime, the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body.	Archangel is right on this one. It's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus, which has a separate blood system, and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person...

This means more time to hunt and reproduce carrying the mutation onwards.	Reptile develops feathers. They offer reduced protection.
1	oh really? where might i see this cowboy? might i have some evidence to support your appalling claims? pick any cowboy movie .. any	sadly all the marketing around it is pointed on children whom simply aren't capable of deciding if they want to became addicted and die because of it or not. you obviously must have never seen a smoking commercial or public signs. you must not have a large brain either if you think that it doesnt affect the kids by even a smudge.  what they see is a 'cowboy' with revolver in one hand a cigarette in other.... and that is the primary source of smokers. oh really? where might i see this cowboy? might i have some evidence to support your appalling claims?
1	A gutless coward mocking a soldier like a parrot, that's funny. Roasted parrot under glass is a fitting end emoticonXGood	You're the one arguing you worked for free, not me. Besides, I figured by now you would realize I'm making fun of you for sensationalizing the debate.
0	yeah you're saying what it isn't but not saying what it is. i'm not sure what you mean as physical either. can i ask you out straight -- are you suggesting a metaphysical component to 'you'? this questions just, i feel, needs to be answered because i'm still trying to grasp what your saying. to a degree? as soon as it changes you are something else surely? i would be wraith +1 or, after a heavy night out wraith -20 -- the 'wraith' bit is just seemingly a conveniance to show nothing more than perceived lineage -- i'm not the same frame of refference at any given point as i was a second ago. i might as well be called cow +20 after eating, and assimilating a beef burger, the lineage part really is quite meaningless.	for the teleporter, i agree that you would be dead. i am not trying to argue that 'you' would ever cease to be dead when the new you was created. i believe that you would be dead the moment your body was destroyed, and when it was rebuilt, that would not be you. if two such clones were created, then there would be two clones, but neither would be you. this is why i am saying that who we are is more than our physical selves, indeed the teleporter example seems to prove it, therefore we are also our frame of reference. yes, your brain and your senses change to a degree, but your frame of reference remains that of wraith, which is why you remain you your entire life.
1	Use some common sense, would you. And while you're at it, trying reading! I said, and you quoted me as saying:	No, it isn't. If people find use for it, it isn't useless. I find the stories very useful from a historical/cultural way.

0	If a square is opposite to a circle (and it isn't, by the way), then gas/liquid/solid must be opposites therefore you contain opposites (by your own argument), in that you contain elements that are in these 'opposite' states. It's an argument I raised before, you said they weren't opposites, now you cite non-opposites! Why do you keep refuting previous arguments they YOU have made?	Just as one defines:infinite: not finitevsfiniteJust as one defines:SquarevscircleWait, here is the kicker Montalban:existentnonexistentrealunrealIf you need more examples to understand that definitions do not necessarily represent "real" things, just let me know.I just made a claim about non-existent.

0	actually, quite correct. i am surprised. i woudl have thought you more of the relativistic type.	and that truth can be demonstrated objectively so that all can accept it. something true for some but not others is not true in the true sense of the word.
1	So let me get this right. To counter Accipiter's statement that you have the intellectual maturity of a 10 y/o, you string together a bunch of words that you don't understand in context that makes absolutely no sense? Point - set - match Accipiter.	I believe it's rather common knowledge around here that your premature synaptic transmitter aberrations and neuronal abnormalities, along with myelin sheath decomposition and sodium propagation deficiencies, contribute significantly to your continued cognitive dissonance and penile incontinence.  I also recommend you go to the store and buy a hat before somebody stretches a you-know-what over your head.
1	oh yeah? you can't out-post me! i type about 20 wpm. i still look at the keyboard when i type... which means, ultra-focus! i can switch between my right index finger and my left index finger. i'm a posting machine... try me.	i will out post off you any day of the week pal. i will post so much information your head will spin. some of it may even be related, never know.
1	do you know what a marriage is under the law? oh yeah, that's right, a legal union. they are the exact same thing just with different names, its like if i had two identical roses and called them joe and sam, they're still both the same rose.	yes, but the title comes with benefits. people will definitely look differently on your resume if they see 'legally united' over 'married'. it's all well and good that everyone has a water fountain, but if that separate water fountain isn't really the same, then it's not fair.
0	Exactly, which brings us back to square 1. Creationism is based on religion, and Evolution is based on the Scientific method, but is not proven. Creationism isnt even near being proven. So, why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children?	Actually, "evolutionism" does have meaning, but not in biology anymore. Biologists stopped using it over 100 years ago. From WikipediaSome important concepts (and why the word no longer has meaning in biology) is the concept of an intrinsic need to improve. Such concepts were discredited with Darwin. As is pointed out, opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with "creationism". While "creationism" is a belief in mythology based on no evidence, no one "believes" in evolution. Evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution.

1	VoR is about as Catholic as the Archbishop of Cantebury. I'm curious about what I'm right about though, seeing as I asked you whether you think that medically un-necessary abortions should be legal or not.	Yes, you are 100% right; but the moment I say otherwise, VoR chastises me for not being Catholic-enough.
0	So for example if I say "you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are "a part" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.	You claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of “empirical fact”, this is just not so. I think you should rethink what “empirical fact” is. Empirical fact, are facts that are said to be true on the basis of empirical observation. If I see a light on in a room, that is an empirical observation, and for me, that the light is on, is an empirical fact. However, if you and I both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on, I think, is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb. I say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function, you say its something else, and that's a mater if ideology, not mere observation.
0	You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth emoticonXRolleyes An egg is NOT larva, and larva is NOT a caterpillar, and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo, and a embryo is NOT a fetus, and a fetus is NOT a baby, and a baby is NOT an adult. I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!	you yourself were once in exactly the same position and condition as an unborn child is now, and look at what you have become.
0	hun dont let no ones opinions bother you. no one matters but you, because your living your life and its your body. i personally think everyone shold hold off till 16 but im not going to insult you because thats just plain retarded. what gives you people the right to insult someone for asking a question? im not talking about freedom of speech im talking about being a nice person. nobody has manners anymore, i swear.	and you, phunting, need a thump on the head from my brolly!
0	so in what way are the sperm and egg not human pray tell? are your sperm/eggs from some other species? are they lizard life? elephant life? what kind of life do they have (and you admit they do) outside of human life? sorry but sperm and egg are human and they are alive, how can you deny both statuses? oh yes if both sperm and egg are living matter then the claim 'life begins at conception' is patently false. i will assume you modify that phrase now to be 'human life begins at conception' but that is also clearly false on the face of it.	at no time did i state the component parts of this seperate, human life, were dead.  thanks for not making such assumptions. we're talking, i remind you, about human life. not sperm life. not egg life. you really need to follow the specific issues here. you'd fail miserably in a court of law...unless you have razzle dazzle... :p

1	I'm with Smiley: you're describing yourself perfectly, save for referring to conservatives instead of liberals.	Don't you get it Bassman? lyteboy can raise any issue he likes, but God help the conservative for calling him on his blatant ignorance and bigotry against anything and anyone who dares disagree with his warped view of reality. He doesn't need reason nor a rational thought process in order to attack us. All that is required is that we dare to comment at all. Like a poisonous viper he will strike out without ever considering if what he say's is either true or reasonable.

Talk about perversion....get out of my decision to be faithful or not - CREEP.
0	it's a pretty obvious counter question, i'm surprised it caught him so off guard. what's his name, if you don't mind my asking? i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district.	you make a great point, one i had brought up to my state senator as well. i asked him if he had ever been sued for not hiring anyone for any reason. his reply was that he had not, granted it was punctuated with stammering and stuttering as he answered. i knew i had hit the nail on the head and caught him off guard. he had no response. yes, i'm sure it was just his excuse for maintaining his personal bigotry against gays/lesbians.
1	Ah, historical inevitability. I had no idea you were a marxist, Steeeeve! Unfortunately for you the same argument applies to the collapse of capitalism. And once again you conflate capitalism and freedom. Have you never heard of anarcho-syndicalism? And why is someone more free when their life is controlled by corporations than when those corporations are restrained by a democratic government?	Like you say, it depends on how you define best...furthermore, a destruction caused by limiting freedom takes some time. These countries haven't been around that long remember (in terms of the type of government).
1	Hey that would be great. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners of military service age and ability to own a fully automatic rifle. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners to train with the weapon. The law would FORCE VOR to keep his rifle clean. Hey VOR how about it? Keep your rifle clean or go to jail. I'm not talking about my rifle, I'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean. How about you?	Yes it can, because they can/do own firearms besides those issued by the government. Plus, once they are retired from the military, they get to keep their rifles or pistols. Every round of the military's ammo is acounted for, because they don't want them waisting their money... They can shoot as much of their private stock as they want. Also, they have very stringent guidelines on cleaning your weapons. :)

0	no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status.	what??? you mean they don't think that most people are out to exterminate gays? that most people actually do have reasons for their beliefs, and that the world doesn't always line up with the all-or-nothing 'equality-obsessed' modern gay pride movement?  who'da thunk it? emoticonxgood  the idea that most people hate gays is, of course, a propagandist view by the gay pride movement. i would hope judges wouldn't fall into that way of thinking, and the fact these judges did not shows they are good judges.

0	That's a bit of a sidestep. Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc. There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide. Frankly, I think it's easier to do the latter (yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty).If you want to make an argument, then make an argument. But don't call abortion genocide; that's just dumb.	(gen·o·cide - n. The deliberate and systematic destruction of a national, racial, religious, political, cultural, ethnic, or other group defined by the exterminators as undesirable.[snip]Abortion supporters are infuriated at the notion that abortion is comparable to the Holocaust because they incessantly argue that the unborn aren't people.
0	So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say "Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."	He said it in Genisis, and yes the Bible is inspired by god, No its not poofed down by him but through his prophets he did get his message accross. If you choose not to believe it... Oh well your funeral.
0	But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.	Geologic time/millions of years ago (mybp)/days per year late Precambrian/900mybp/487 days earliest Cambrian Period/600mybp/424 days early Ordovician Period/500mybp/412 days middle Devonian Period/370mybp/398 days Permo-Triassic boundary/245mybp/386 days "Jurassic Park"/180mybp/381 days end Cretaceous (Chixulub)/65mybp/371 days

0	That's not something you can really blame on the pro-life movement. In fact, a lot of effort in the pro-life movement does go into helping single mothers. Many pro-life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways, including financially.	I can appreciate this slant, however I think that a true feminist approach would be to support women who want their pregnancies by finding solutions to the reasons they feel an abortion would be their best choice.If we want to have a child, society should be backing us up on that. Instead, I see such a stigma for single mothers, I see single mothers unable to finish school, I see single mothers unable to work a decent job b/c of either lack of education or lack of child care, I see systems where the men don't have to support, violence, et cetera.
1	Aww, you didn't read a top criminoligist I quoted before did you?The "Myth" of Gun TraffickingYou also didn't check out mexidata.com either did you?Now you need proof to back up your alligator mouth. Where's the beef sliiiiick?	California gun-control laws cut flow to Mexico - SFGate "A Hearst Newspapers survey of guns purchased in the United States and funneled to Mexican drug traffickers found that out of 1,600 guns identified by brand name and purchase point in court documents, a mere 70 came from California." all 70 of which: "In the Hearst survey's lone California case, Ayman Nabil Ghaly, a federal agriculture inspector at California-Mexico border posts, was charged last year with purchasing 70 guns, mostly handguns, for resale in Mexico. He bought them at gun stores in the San Diego area from June 2005 to September 2006, mostly one or two at a time."

1	If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.	Biology shouldn't simply deal with the facts about different animals, natural selection, evolution, etc. but should also deal with how information is gathered, and different ways of analyzing it as well as different hypothesies rather than what is thought at the time to be the facts.

1	love vs. pepersack again? what you don't realize is love got her gun.	this is the part you are misquoting. 'it is not within judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.' now it states the shotgun with a barrel length of eightteen inches is not military equipment.  so if the anti gun/gun control advocates are going to use this to defend their claim they are wrong.

0	If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it.	Those quotes have nothing to do with abortion. This one has to do with babys in the woumb "Befor I formmed you in the woumb, I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet amoungst nations" Jeremiah 1:4-5I think this is rellavent because God wants everyone to be a prophet who he can work through.

0	It seems to be the reason for crafting this new, individual right against the States. Since the original purpose of the Second Amendment doesn't appear to be needed, there is a new use that is protected.	Let's be honest, it won't result in any more or less gun deaths and even if it resulted in more gun deaths it would be worth having the amendment. The 2nd amendment was only created to give citizens a last resort should the government fail us. It may seem like we don't need that now but one day it really might come in handy and people shouldn't forget that. I still think incorporation is a load of BS though...for any amendment. Damn you 14th amendment!

0	This seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists.	The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. Personally, I disagree. When we kill children in Iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all.
0	I think I posted that awhile ago. Its huge BS. Thats like saying "Civil rights hurt blacks". Even though abortion may have some unwated side affects, its no where near the emotional and physical pain and suffering for the rest of your life than a forced pregnancy. Just goes to show that the pro-life movement is desperate.	http://www.catholiceducation.org/art...on/ab0102.htmlI actually haven't read all of this article yet, but it looks interesting.

0	And the point was, Benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. If you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. If it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. If it is a web page, then the URL should be given.Even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. Generally AIG is really bad science and isn't very interesting. It is misleading, intentionally. However, on these boards are familiar with their stuff.	Oh, and yes that is where I got that information, and took it directly from their web page.

0	Don't be so faithful in our laws. Remember prohibition? Of course, I myself highly doubt that Obama will manage to ban firearms, but mark my words, he will do anything in his power to restrict them.	This pretty much sums up people like Penfold. This difinitivly shows that he believes your right to own firearms should be taken away. Thank heaven our founding fathers sought to protect us from the likes of him and enumerated our right to keep and bear arms. Happy New Year
1	could it be that they've finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms? each time the control-lobby comes up with an argument....they get shot to pieces. (laugh out loud!) it is interesting to note that both of the democratic front-runners for 2008 favor gun control. with the recent death of charlton heston, there's a weakness in the armor of the nra. i would go on a handgun buying spree, but i already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call 'the little alamo'.	where in the hell did all the anti-gunners on this board go? did they all run off or give up the fight?
1	Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.	And it's so bleedin' unnecessary, too! Why not just create the universe as it is? And just let the light take it's sweet time to get here? Imagine what proof for creationism that would be: we can only see stars out to 6000 light years or so; looking at old star charts we realize that people 1000 years ago could only see stars out to 5000 light years; and as time goes by additional stars appear in the sky as the light from them finally reaches us. If God did create the universe only 6000 years ago, the fact that we can see the entire universe now can only count as a deliberate, I will repeat, a deliberate, oh how I love that word, DELIBERATE deception on the part of the creator.

0	When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified.	so it’s the scientific community that sets up communication within a society, and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up? hahaha – sorry but i’m not convinced.  i’m not “in” science, other than unwillingly contributing my tax dollars – however small the percentage is – to a social agenda of those who control the scientific community. i’m permitted to have “theories” about it. emoticonxangel when the word “theory” is applied to a very wide range of subjects, it’s not fair to label someone who questions one theory a rejecter of all theories. that’s what the link in the opening post did – that’s not rational discourse, it’s not secular open inquiry, it’s not a search for truth or knowledge. it’s political/atheist rhetoric - look at the bottom of the page and whose name do we see? richard dawkins, what a surprise. and a quick google of “edgar pearlstein” shows a sarah palin hating atheist liberal just like him. emoticonxrolleyes science has a role in the control of the people atheists do, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that they represent science. you haven’t gotten in over your head – most who post here don’t know much about science. tq doesn’t, and of course he’ll tell you that i don’t. there’s a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel “intellectually fulfilled”, to discredit religion. some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn’t written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. michael ruse and bradley monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. religious authors, practically too many to name. william dembski, david berlinski, phillip johnson, cornelius hunter, many others. you would do well to read anything by any of these people. far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like richard dawkins. he’s become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. michael behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. read “the edge of evolution”, or “darwin’s black box” sometime. :) some irreducible complex structures, but not all of them. for atheists, that’s good enough. but it’s not good enough for everyone. in behe’s words; “…as biochemists have begun to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella, they have discovered staggering complexity, with dozens or even hundreds of precisely tailored parts. …as the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets.” behe wrote this in 1996, and since then it has only gotten worse for the atheists, no matter how much they dance.

1	and i am a clump of human cell with shoes on...what is your point? no. you seem to refuse the idea that 'human' as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up. i am sorry you don't understand this but the word means what it means. i find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway. your sperm is a human now? you should invest in a biology book.	yup. however, i am a clump of human cells with intelligence. how do you define 'member'? is my sperm a member? technically, so is my sperm no matter how much you close your eyes and say 'no its not', but masturbation isn't murder is it?

You'd be riding an expensive bicycle and eating expensive dog food. Don't believe everything your politicians tell you to conceal US industrial ineptness. China will continue adjusting the Yuan peg to USD in small increments until US markets are no longer required or desired by Japan or China.

His findings were inconclusive... biased and his study groups and samples were doctored.
1	Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that "evolution" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance.	Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.
0	Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it...........That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people............They can't win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the courts....It won't happen.get use to it................

0	the word touched me in a bad place... i think it was at summer camp or something... i'm still scarred.... no but seriously even i don't believe that... how exactly is word spiritual? is it intentional? based upon the interpretation an individual gets from it? seeing as how the history of the bible itself and it's original writings, many interpretations, denominations, and debates over itself is construed it can hardly be seen as itself being spiritual. is it possible that through god the manuscripts and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality? yes. but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly isn't glowing with the essence of god.... it's debated if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exists has the essence of god to this day...	and you never know when a word of god will touch you, because the word itself is spiritual. for the word of god is living and active. sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. - hebrews 4:12

0	the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex. there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals. in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds. and why shouldn't they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right. if you don't qualify then you don't enter. by all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.	ah, well, then you in you 'broad and unprejudiced view'emoticonxrolleyesemoticonxrolleyes can obviously tell us those supposed myriad other views. i wait with bated breath for your answer.

0	To be honest...I don't know. But I do know that to argue something is false because the consequences are not desired is a logical fallacy (Appeal to Consequences).So is the argument I posted earlier (posted below for quick reference) true or false? And if false, why?A) Only science should be taught in science class (this is why creationism should not be taught in science class).B) Science is a collection of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.Conclusion: If A is true and B is valid then science class should only consist of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.	I'm having difficulty here. Maybe a list of what is taught as science now that would be disqualified would simplify things? As has been said, Astrophysics would be out?
0	The short answer is that it isn't. See the details here: Phil Plait	Karl,Thanks for offering to teach me. I do have many questions. The sun is shrinking. If one does the math backwards on it, the Earth cannot be as old as evolutionists claim it to be, can it? It would burn up.

0	None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about "information" or something.	Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given..."Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria." "All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme"http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.aspTalkorigins gave their usual doubletalk"Whilst this particular case does not "prove" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution."Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmOne poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..." In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantagesBut, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain? If nylon eating bacteria was "proof" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source."http://www.christianforums.com/t52336

1	so was dominating and enslaving of women. doesn't mean we should do it just because it has historicity.  actually i've heard this idea by numerous people, on both sides of the issue. i can see the merits myself--give couples' benefits in a way that doesn't utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with. that way at least cultural marriage doesn't have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group's cultural and ideological views.  by the way, what do you mean by 'anti-gay' in your phrase 'anti-gay people'? that's always important to nail down.	i guess you're reading it wrong, then. back then, marriage was a commitment to one another and did not have legal meanings. that's just it. if you want to go by the original definition of marriage, like so many anti-gay people talk about, no one who gets a marriage should get legal benefits. however, they would never be willing to give this up, so by denying gays the right of those same benefits for the same commitment, it is just pure and unadulterated bigotry. by the way, look at post #9 to see what i think of the whole civil union movement.

According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so.

Do you know of any other crimes that your are guilty of when your are innocent in the past then the law makes you guilty later for a past event?If the speed limit is 40 mph on Monday, the law makes it 30 mph on Tuesday, are you guilty of speeding when it was Monday?

1	yeah, archie, i don't know what i was thinking. how could i form an opinion on the deeds of you and easy after about 6 years of interacting with the two of you, and watching the abuse and vile you spew on everyone who doesn't agree with your hate filled rhetoric? sorry about that, i must have been thinking of two other ignorant, insulting xxxxxxxs.	i've lived it, you haven't. after you've spent 5 years volunteering for free, feeding and clothing the poor, and preaching the gospel at a run down christian rescue mission to ex-cons and the drug-and-alcohol addicted, as i have, then come talk to me about works. john 8:24
1	Repent, you Christ-denying, gay bashing radical heathen.. well, you already are going to end up in the Pit.	You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and minds. You're just like your fathers - you always deny the Holy Spirit. - Acts 7:51Now repent, you Christ-denying, god-bashing radical heathen, before you wind up in the Pit.
0	What good has come from religion? None that I can see.	Many died at the hands of slavery. But it's beside the point. Pointing out bad things that have happened in Christianity in no way refutes that good things have happened as well. You're arguing from a position of complete nonacceptance of good from religion. I'm arguing both: that religion has been good AND bad. You're ONLY arguing the bad and can't bring yourself to accept (or admit) that it has and can also be good. And when that good is pointed out with real examples, you change the subject to something that ignores the point, such as "ignorance is never good" or something like that. Well, it's NOT ignorant for Mel White to believe in equality. So religion isn't always ignorant, either.
1	I am still waiting for you to tell me why the gay priests only molested boys.......It has to do with how they are physically contructed.........	The sex of the child victims does not tell us the adult sexual orientation of the criminal. This applies whether the victims are all boys or all girls.
0	'Self-defense' never enters into it, imo. Unwillingness to share ones body is not necessarily self-defense, so this does not apply.	The violinist analogy suggests that a mother has no more responsibility for the welfare of her child than she has to a total stranger. McDonagh's view is even worse. She argues the child is not merely a stranger, but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self-defense.
0	No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic.	How can you discuss creationism without talking about God? Is it irrelavent?
0	so? the assertion was 'evolution is based on evidence - what do you have' suggesting that one side has 'evidence' and the other none. i am simply 'balancing' it out by showing that the assertion isn't black vs white as made out.	your bible of today is as truthful as the religions of the past. it isn't the same as the nest day.

0	yet everything in that site is cited with sources such as cnn and what not. i understnad the florida right to life is not credible to our discussion(as they are not neutral) however the things they cite are...and that is what you should look at. so murder is a subjective term now...i laugh at that. your point was what again? they fact that vor didn't prove his case and never does? i don't understand....however, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones).	more stupidity. neither your site nor vor substance free posts proves that 99% of abortions are 'murder.' besides, that is a subjective term. applying a subjective term and then using it to declare a fact instantly invalides such a claim. it is merely a opinion. besides, what is 'extreme?' my point still stands.  so now you're telling me where i shouldn't be? emoticonxrolleyes
0	it's not a state's issue from a gay rights perspective, if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same-sex couples is illegal in marriage, as it did for inter-racial couples. what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage, be called? we already have such a contract. there's no need to totally re-invent the wheel at this particular time. foundit is correct. it's telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage.	foundit, obviously you have never actually bothered to read the libertarian position on marriage, which is to replace it with contract law, before complaining about it. contract law easily covers phenomena like divorce. if you spent 5 seconds researching the issue you would realise this. your 'one big example' is one big strawman, as usual. and yes, as above, ron paul's position, which is less strong, is to get the federal government out and leave it to the states.
1	a bit over the top here eh? quicksand?...butcher babies? wow...very sensational... i have a question for ya ez? do you own any slaves? do you have a beard or long hair? have you stoned any non-virgin brides lately. seeing as though you are so adherant to the bible....i figure you at best have smited a neighbor or two this week?	if you had the missing link you people would parade it around like your long lost messiah. its quite convenient to contend it doesnt really matter. but neither do the unborn children you liberals love to abort / butcher, i guess. but thats okay. build your house on a bed of quicksand and sleep tight. ignorance is bliss, i guess.
0	so what? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards. he believed in freedom but owned slaves. wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color. this stance is very consistent with his double standard. he was also an adulterous, womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves. so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children.	whosoever shall be guilty of rape, polygamy, or sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least. - thomas jefferson that's your man jefferson, whom you love to quote elsewhere. how do you like those apples?
0	Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.	did you miss the part where it is... the attempt to abort. which kills the women.    it is not child birth that kills those women.    it is an attempt to abort.      if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died.    Having a child, is not
0	So, you don't see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun?? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one.	I don't see how this makes her as an anti-gun candidate. She's the one that resisted America signing onto the global arms trade treaty.
0	who said pregnancy is the only bad thing? we already talked about ceverical cancer. furthermore, condoms don't always work...bad protection. maybe not, but wearing a bright red sign that says 'stalk me' sure will get the ones that are out there. your limited world shield you from the realities of life...which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents. aren't you a warm-hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum... does anyone else think this is rather odd?	hmmm, you dont say? i kinda noticed. well, i did prevent. its called a condom. which was used. next question! you know that the world isnt a bunch of stalkers right? so it's a point thats getting really old. so find a new one please. i would still do it. just because he doesnt approve wouldnt stop me. not at all. it would make me think about it again. but i dont think it would completely stop me. arent we witty. hahahaha. my side hurts from not laughing. no, my parents will take of ur little punching bag. k?  p.s.- this is her friend chelsea! have fun!

1	So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?Interesting...	Keep it up zardoz, you only condemn yourself with your anti-christian zealotry and hypocrisy. You claim to properly interpret a bible you admit you don't even accept as truth. The hubris you exhibit would be laughable if it wasn't so pathetic. DR has more humble truth in his little finger nail than you have accumulated in your whole spiritually destitute life. If you would sincerely seek a truth greater than yourself, you might actually be set free to find it. And I sincerely do say this out of love. emoticonXAngel
0	However, so much of the sex, in fact, most of the sex that happens, gay or straight, does not lead to reproduction. Why is there not the same aversion to oral sex, masturbation, condoms, dating, etc.? No one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights, be excluded, or should not be equal, provided those people are not gay.	ases of aversion against gays, because homosexuality would be anathema toward procreation of the species. I realize this is all just theory. But I've never been comfortable attributing opposition to matters involving gay people just to religion-based morality. There are too many holes in that idea.
1	bitm (or whomever), are u sure that you weren't banned because you were caught blatantly lying? cause that seems pretty actionable to me. and welcome back broker! we've missed you're sensible conservativism!	admin, can you please search into this and let pnac know how wrong he is? i have never had that name, and don't even know who the guy is. actually, 'you and he' sounds pretty bad, grammatically speaking. i'm sorry that i upset you by pointing out facts. how old are you? and did you once have the name apathy? just curious.
1	geeze, oldsarge, i'm sorry you missed the rabies shots when they were passing them out. i'm surprised to see you still around frothing at the mouth.	from what i have seen of your prior posts you wouldn't know a value if it slapped you. are you still beating your live in?
0	this is rather naive. who would willing condemn themselves to hell? many people commit sins regardless of the punishment. here's a little conversation to save time... i understand texas has the death penalty. are there any muders still going on? yes. why? who would condemn themselves to death? some people don't think they're going to get caught. they don't want to die themselves, but they just plain think what they do, they can get away with.	well, if god actually exist than so would hell, and who would want to go there. again, enlightened self-interest. :) i thought that sin was defeated by christ's 'sacrifice'? why? why not? aferall that is the only true way to either prove or disprove the existence of god. you could have believed in one god and died and discovered that you believed in th wrong god. i'm just keeping all of my options open. :)
1	ok to lie?? no. having people preaching 'the evolution of species from a cell to every living creature and plant life on earth', and tell me 'its darwin's origin of species, you should try reading it sometime', after i had just presented them an entire paragraph from hitler's meine kempf - entertaining! having your beloved talkorigins crew flunk the test straight-up as they were asked, 'who said the following, _________, hitler or darwin?', while going a whopping 0-3 for a revealing score of zero............ ...............priceless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	ok, now i follow you: it's ok to lie through your teeth, as long as you are entertained by the results that follow.
1	1) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted?? if you can't say its because you are a typical anti american liberal. 2) nothing to suppoprt it? if anti-american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives.  the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range. on the far left you'd have romney and on the far right you'd have ron paul. now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution.	and once again you have only your twisted opinion and nothing to support it..
1	So it doesn't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless, whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s: they are both equal? What planet do you live on, for it sure aren't the real world...	...I am not sure your wealth makes you different from someone else. It means you wealth is unequal..we are talking about just people. We all end up 6 foot under (so to speak) in the end.
0	No, Creationism is the specific idea that the creation story in Genesis is literally true (creation ex nihilo, direct creation of organisms, global flood, etc). It is false.	Creationism, by the way, is used very broadly. It is simply the study of how we were created, just as evolution is the study of how we "evolved".
1	Where is the government in this? Clinicians made a clinical decision, and hid behind a non-mandatory guideline, which was set by other more senior clinicians, expert in their field. Assuming the woman's very detailed recall of the stressful series of events is accurate, perhaps it was God's way of telling this unmarried mother that after five previous miscarriages, she still wasn't getting the message.	and here is what you get when the government gets a hold of it. premature baby 'left to die' by doctors after mother gives birth just two days before 22-week care limit | mail online
0	"Supposedly"? You ran from those threads. You are the one making assertions that you don't back up. You are the one unwilling (i.e. unable) to show that Arctic foxes can adapt to a Phoenix summer. You are the one who keeps ignoring (what I will henceforth refer to as) The Chihuahua Challenge. For somebody claiming to be so clearly right and so obviously vindicated by the evidence, you've done nothing to show it, and you've done everything to run from it.	It's funny how you intellectually-inept fools resort to talking about how I was supposedly outdebated or embarrased or whatever in other forums yet you are unable to do it here.
0	Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.	Belief that memory and free will exist but do not take up space does not require belief in a personal god.
0	It won't. I'd think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active (a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion. Like vehicle insurance she may never need it, but going without either one is plain stupid.	18-19 year olds anyway. It's still illegal for over the counter under the age of 18.Wait a minute, I fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not.
1	With a standing president breaking the law to 'protect' you, this should be expected.	Wow, isn't the point of a bar to drink? People can be picked up, driven by someone not drinking, or use other transportation (if they live close, walk, maybe public transportation). It is horribly wrong when we start arresting people because they "might" commit a crime.
0	Welcome back! Going to stick around for a while to debate the issues? I hope so. Let's see. How am I going to stop the employee. Hmmm...perhaps proper pre-employment screening, proper security screening for all airport employees as they come to work, random surveilance of airport employees, tougher penalties for those commiting such crimes...etc. There are many ways to do this. Remember that no security measures are perfect. We will never be safe, only safer.And what is your point about weapons/guns? I don't get it.	How are you going to stop an airline employee that has access to the airplanes from hiding a gun onboard the airplanes for terrorists to use? Nice use of the term weapon by you in past post. Any item a person is carrying can be used as a weapon
0	Again? What do you mean? I am talking about different sciences per se. What is your question?	Again, how does this apply?
0	economic understanding does not come from a series of graphs and equations that come from a man who has no understanding of how humans work. the economy is not some mechanical machine, it is an organic mass of all 7 billion people of the world making millions decisions every day. behind all the smoke and mirrors, all this man said was this, in other words, concluded bullshit is still bullshit.  and your second point, companies also compete on a technological level, if they aren't as advanced as their competitors they generally go out of business because people want the better quality/cheaper product. what is the states incentive? getting re-elected? oh wait, thats easy to do when 95% of voters have no clue as to what is going on and only think about politics for 5 minutes during the elections.	it does prove mathematically. i provided the necessary formula.  on the second point, technology does cause the price of the means of production and labor to decrease. you're completely right on this. but the thing is, can technology keep up with demand? this is harder than it sounds because we are continually having crises. i found this video which explains things much more in -depth.
0	Finally someone answered the question. Thanks. I thought it might be the government.Does your government attempt to do this?What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?	Afraid of? Well guns are a pretty good deterrent from the government trying to take away my rights. And shooting at criminals makes criminals rethink trying to steal my stuff.
0	Been saying that ever since the first time I heard about creationsism.	Creationism starts with a conclusion, and finds data to support it. According to the scientific method, one is suppose to look at data, and draw a conclusion from it. Therefore, creationism is not science, and needs not take any scientific consideration. The end.
1	Ah, so we shouldn't get all stirred up because little girls are singled out for slaughter?Please excuse me for having misplaced priorities.	all what simone does is stir things up.

1	So, if a baby is having trouble breathing that's been born already, you don't consider it a 'person'? Methinks you've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all.	Among other things, the newborn must obtain its own oxygen and its own nourishment. It must also transition from an aquatic environment to an aerobic one.

1	Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago. My beef has been the resident "experts" here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand. That, by the way, is found in Economics 101. But you knew that, didn't you?So now, it's a "technical" correction. What's next? Some wisdom from Joe Granville or the Elliot Wave Theory?Ball in your court.	It's called a technical correction, and if you had any knowledge about these things you would know this. All commodities and equities have gone up substantially over the last year and a correction was in order. Oil broke through a 5 year old resistance line a while back and that usually means that the price is going down even further. I expect oil to be heading towards the mid 40's before going up again after the OPEC production cut at the end of the month. And if you think that inflation has no effect on the price of oil or any other commodity/stock, then you're either ignorant, stupid or both. Inflation affects the price of everything on this planet.
0	well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels.	for once i find myself agreeing with randomdude. i've been in a church of several christian denominations and never seen a 'holy' bible that was just the nt. i've never been to a church where all the sermons are drawn exclusively from the nt. and i know that most christians embrace things like the ten commandments, which are ot all the way. the ot is a prelude, it sets a backstory for the coming of christ, but things depicted in it (like original sin) are essential to the message of jesus; without the ot, the nt is baseless nonsense - well, more than it is already, anyways.

1	Ahhh I see so God was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor. Like how Sodom and Gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor.	You're missing the bigger picture. I don't see the conflict, BIBLICALLY SPEAKING. Because in the Kingdom of God there is also judgment. Ever read about the Israelis coming under judgment and being enslaved by the Babylonians? Why did that happen to them? BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LOVE GOD AND THEIR NEIGHBORS AS THEMSELVES. They broke the law of love. God didn't break it, they did. So, because they hated and did not turn from their wicked ways, they came under judgment. And if you read the book of Judges, that usually humbles the people and turns their hearts back to God. That's why I say there is no conflict. God's economy makes sense.
1	Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.  Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans? Naw, I don't think I should. They're just poor people and they probably didn't vote for me.	and what does that have to do with the price of rice in china? are you suggesting that in the event of a natural disaster you have the right to choose? if a tornado tore you from your bed and cast you into oblivion, that was your choice? maybe so. emoticonxrolleyes no doubt many lives were lost in no due to lack of means as well as ignorance but how that relates to convenience abortion on demand and the social acceptance of them escapes me. emoticonxwow

0	i'm not in the least surprised.. i stated that it was required by law.. i never said anything about when it became a requirement. as of now, in the year 2010 applying for a ss number is required.. would you say that is an invasion of privacy?..  and for your information clinton wasn't the first or last president to rape the social security program.. politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades.	maybe from 1986, i'm a mite older than that. they can't pass a retroactive law now can they? mine still says, 'not for identification purposes'. think they can make that ex post facto? even the county clerk isn't entitled to that information. my birth certificate doesn't have it either, maybe obama's does if we can find the birth certificate and heel print ? when clinton was president, he and lloyd bentsen and his fed chief bundled up all the ss money and sold them off as securities. long before 1986, the ss money was removed from the account and put in the general fund so they could spend it. look up what date registration became mandatory and try not to be too surprised.
1	Shhhh . . . don't tell anyone: Habitat for Humanity is a religious (GASP) organization. Those mean old hateful Christians--helping giving homes to needy people . . .	What I would like to see is a rather antiquated method of community. Have all the destroyed housing areas razed and bulldozed to level, bare soil, then have massive 'barn-raising' house building, where the people (in that area) pitch in to rebuild each others houses (and build theirs). It's somewhat like Habitat for Humanity too, with the difference being all neighbors pitch in.
1	Actually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in "evolutin" [sic]. The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested. It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate. It is based on evidence and not faith.	ok were supposed to believe in GOd and then believe in evolutin...
0	I think you are on to something.The problem I see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $$$ and propaganda.Here's hoping now that there's a new sheriff in town.	I'm really not so sure about Obama's healthcare plan, when I read it it seems kind of wishy-washy...# like what does "Reform the insurance market to increase competition by taking on anticompetitive activity that drives up prices without improving quality of care." actually mean?# In practice?# I'm more interested in the Health Care for America plan more, it's a proposal put together by the political scientist Jacob Hacker with the support of the Economic Policy Institute. I'd suggest reading Thinking Big to get a better idea of the plan, but the basic idea is that employers pay money into a public fund, enough to cover their workers.# The public fund should have quality coverage for all, including preventive care.# Workers get to choose - keep your insurance, choose a different private plan, or join a public health insurance plan without a private insurer middleman, pick your healthcare providers and doctors.# Employers choose too. Those who prefer not to shoulder the burden of providing coverage as good as the law requires can decide to enroll their workers in the public plan at a modest cost.# HCFA and Medicare would function as a single nationwide insurance pool covering close to half the population. So basically either the public plan attracts most Americans, and our system gradually evolves into single-payer or because the floor prevents a race to the bottom, the public-private competition raises the bar on care and efficiency, improving quality and cutting costs, even in the private insurance plans.# The standards would be kept by a strong government watchdog.# What do you think?
1	Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage. So by all means don't marry a man and the problem is solved.	3) Of course if you throw out morality as a basis for law, there's no reason, other than economics, to not allow gay marriage.

0	So what's the deal when GWB "gives" $3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $6,000, the family can't make up the difference and the $3,000 goes unspent. All we've accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury. You think it's a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it? You're thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus.	Seems like you criticize him for allowing the government to "give" something, then criticize because it's not enough.
0	besides pain, there is a plethora of experiences that take place in a person's mind that cannot be yet detected by science. imagination, taste, dreams, art appreciation, etc. even though these things are real, they cannot be quantitatively described in physical terms, so they cannot be treated by science	I honestly cannot think of a case were a non-materialistic approach explains something you can measure very well.

0	That's the standard dance. Victor Stenger didn't say it that way. On the back of his book, one review puts it this way;	Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah, not that there is no God.Now, if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that "a Noah's flood-causing God" does not exist, then kudos. This does not mean that there is no God whatsoever.The error you are making is that you are equating creationism with God. We've disproved special creation. Handily. So one might say that there's good evidence that a God represented by a literal interpretation of the Bible does not exist. But that doesn't mean that no God exists, or that a Christian God doesn't exist.
1	i would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. they have no buisness doing that. very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. its simply a hobby. men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. our rights are going out the window fast.	so guns are more important than the safety of women? then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case?  so men love their guns more than women? is that some kind of homosexuality? ya know a gun is kind of shaped like, um, you know what. a gun does ejaculate in a sense.
1	Oh, gee! There goes my irony meter. It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence. Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone.	I repeat in rebuttal to the ignorant, bigoted and hateful response above. Not to mention anti-american, prejudicial and irrational justification for attempting to deny free americans of their right to vote for a legally held proposition to amend the California Constitution according to the rules outlined in the Constitution of California. And for comparing Americans who simply voted, with Nazi's who more resemble your groups tactics, than the LDS community.
0	i am really surprised this one got so many upvotes :p	this isnt true just because you are one exception doesn't make what i said false. i said people who prefer samsung are often people who know stuff about computers and soft ware.
0	Are you sure? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair. Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone.	An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions.
1	reckon you'll be eating your own words in due time, moose.  not from what i've seen so far in your posts. keep plugging, though, you may find god yet when you run out of all those ill-conceived arguments against him.	the bible is a fable. that final book is a horrorshow of the mentally unhinged. hey, answer the question: is there any possible information you could ever recieve that would weaken your belief in god?'
1	It looks like just Mucusaur, you and me, along with an entire thread of bots! (I'm not too sure about Mucusaur, to be honest!) ;)	The propaganda ministers must be working overtime to hit as many forums as possible. emoticonXRolleyes
0	It is disappointing that you would continue with this mistake. I said that God is both knowable and unknowable. You simply think that equates to the same thing, and thus you argue against what you believe I say, rather than what I said.	described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is).
0	oh thanks i guess it was you who have been upvoting my arguements huh ? xd thanks!  allies ?	yeah red alert 2 is way better than halo wars. halo wars sucks big time. one up-vote for you kroticfate ^^
1	You mean other than the fact that Mr. Pocketwatch and Mrs. Pocketwatch don't meet up for a night of whoopee and end up with little baby pocketwatches some time later? How about: I know that humans manufacture pocketwatches.	Yes, you can see the difference, but what is that difference?
1	You're a Bush-man, aren't you, gnojek? Come on, admit it. With that stance, you'll be in the White House before sunrise.  (You do realize that I was being sarcastic - right?) emoticonXRolleyes	then chrisitanity will be next in line, hopefully. kill'em all!!! emoticonxkill
0	But doesn't Genesis imply that creation occured in one 7-day period (though the days could be symbollic)?	because the earth is older than 10,000 years as many creationists think and the 7 day creation doesn't make sense.
1	Liar, liar, pants on fire. You pro gay sex heathens haven't a clue what's coming your way. And you don't have to like it.	You will be right there in the pit to greet them, Easy. You and Fred Phelps. Peas in a pod.
1	Appears a lot of sensible folks are investing in their 401G and 401A plans ;)	Firearms, ammo see explosive sales growth -- Recession, fear of new federal controls driving increase
1	I disagree. Well, only in that I think it's high time we held everybody to a higher standard. We should suspend hetero marriage until they clean up their act!	Still, I do not feel that percentage likelyhood of a lasting marriage is a good reason to allow or disallow marriage. It is a standard which we hold no other group to, just as we should not hold it to same-sex couples.
1	Maybe you can talk when you provide us with the actual translation.	Ah, the evils of the religious right. Thanks for the warning. You do realise that the translation was supplied by an organisation founded by ex Israeli military intelligence members.....emoticonXRolleyes
0	lol, what did you mean by that? i'm not sure, and dont want to assume the tone you infer with. i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify. ps; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper', although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does'. @ simone, no worries hun :)	we are not talking about the life of the mother, don't be disingenuous. if a woman wants to have a leg amputated, that although crazy in my view, is her right but, as you well know it we are talking about the life of a baby in the womb. the foetus has no choice in the matter, funny that the victim has no say in the crime. pro-lifers speak for the unborn babies, it is as simple as that. ps for an aussie, your english is quite good and i agree with some of your positions.
1	that's not what the bible says. you're playing word games. what next? numerology??? i mean, i can play around with interpreting too. i can take 'roses are red, violets are blue' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to. let's see, roses represent love, and red is the color of blood. a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers, and blue means sad. so what 'roses are red, violets are blue' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful, and people with 'small things' are sad'. bet you never knew that's what it was really saying!	yes, particuarly if you understand the puns in the original hebrew.  adam (mankind) is related to the word (adamah), which means 'red clay'. this is in turn releated to the word edom , which means 'blood'.  the word translated as 'created' is more like the term 'formed', as a potter forms a piece of clay.  so, if you look at it properly, we can see that genesis is saying 'god formed man as a potter forms clay out of flesh and blood'.  the word 'eve' is the word for love. so we can also point out that 'god formed man out of flesh and blood, and gave him love for companionship. that is all without going into the political comentary about conditions between the various cultures at the time.
1	a minute without kids? what's that? :) and about the thread - it might be a touchy subject. reckon? oh, and thanks - i feel 28! emoticonxcool	happy birthday ron!!!!!!!!!! and you have been raising children all your life... duh 8 kids????? do you even remember what it was like to have a quiet moment in your home? and just remember i am big enough to go along with the lucy joke... i even bought a lucy purse this weekend.. i just let it ride.... never let them know how smart you really are :) on edit so many people on right now, there must be more with children... or you and i are just having this conversation by ourselves :)
1	how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport.	When was the last mass murder at a UK university then?
0	This is absurdity. I suppose then that medicine should wreak my body. How about viruses? Am I destroyed by them?	Any random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system. And living things are the most complex functioning systems in the universe.
0	fine. thank you.  what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus. how do you define the moral consensus? in attilas case, would that be among the huns? among the hun ruling elite? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he (for the sake of argument) has no intimate knowledge?  now why should he act in accordance with the consensus?  this is not completely clear to me. so, do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned?	[quote=toby][quote] the relative context, in this instance, is understood to be the assertion that a moral consensus is limited by a shifting perspective - i.e. changing from time to time and from place to place, etc.  a radical relativist might say that's what attila should do - even assuming you have some heinous behaviour in mind: i'm not. it might be argued that moral sentiments are instinctive. i'm not going quite that distance: i'm saying that moral values are expressions of approval/disapproval that don't arise from rational deliberation, but from the affective part of human nature.
