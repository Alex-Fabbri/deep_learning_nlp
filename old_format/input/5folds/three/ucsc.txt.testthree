1	THe religious reigh is not mainstream either. And frankly, you are also confusing politics and religion. You do KNOW that there is a difference? You also know there is a differnece between hateful proclimations and scholarship, don't you??	The liberal left is not mainstream, Trebor. Just check the last election on that one.
0	If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food, why not spare pain and abort?	2. preventing a poor/unhappy life, 2. You have no idea whether the unborn will be 'unhappy', or even poor, for their lifetime. It would be more sensible to evaluate a person's life at, age 10 perhaps, and then kill them if they have been unhappy and are likey to continue. Again, anyone on welfare is a likely target. In fact, it might be expedient to simply nuke the poorest parts of the world.
0	that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran, mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni.  so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before(iraq) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat(aq) and unrelated nation.	well, latest word is that the alphabet soup is taking the threat seriously.
0	It doesn't make sense because no one makes that claim. There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution. That does not mean that evolution is random.	Yet evolutionists tell us that evolution could never happen the same way twice. And the reason they say that -- one of them -- is that NS on the level of the population is random....which makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever.
1	So, a forty year old having sex with a twelve year old is ok then?	I suppose they are really asking for the minimum age of consentual age to be lowered/removed. I would disagree that it should be removed completely, but perhaps lowering it to, say 12 or 13 wouldn't be extremely harmful.
0	Did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.	Who said anything about rape? Peter Tatchell , a British gay activist advocated the age of consent being changed to 14 years old. You see all the straight people know that whatever ther gays get, they will want more..and you just proved it.
0	There are no objective reasons to condemn gays. Marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it.My advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions, believe me I have lost alot of support from conservatives for this, perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes.	And what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if I may ask?I'm assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably don't pertain to you well, cause your not gay....

1	Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?	What a crock. I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy.
0	Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago (a real cave, not one of the commercialized ones). Bats actually have better eyesite than humans, but even they can't see in pitch black. No eye can.	This isn't interesting at all. What did these magical "light-sensitive cells" evolve from? What were they before and what event or process caused them to evolve into light sensing cells? Why do bats continue to rely on sonar to "see?" Why haven't they evolved eyes over time? In my opinion, this guy is basically saying that if you had a bunch of bricks and mortar, a building could be built. He just leaves out how you get the bricks and mortar, which is the whole problem.
0	This is why the title is "God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle :)	The greatest possible (anything you can name) can only exist in a finiteseries. As you point out, this is not the case in an infinite series such asintegers. So the definition that began this thread that God is identified as"the greatest being possible" must limit the possibilities to a finite number.As I write this I can see that it's self-evident - but what I can't see is howthis gets us any closer to showing that God exists (or not) !
0	They are safer. The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then.Let's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies. Only 13% of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them, Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30, and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack, with severe punishments for the seal being broken.	Careful there Sarge. Recently liberals in Switzerland were successful in passing a mandate that militia members are no longer allowed to keep their service weapons and ammunition at home.They're no longer safe because of these pansies having their way.

0	Lots of makers are still churning out lever action rifles. I am sad to see Winchester closed, but sad feelings is not a good financial reason to keep a poorly run company open.	The New Haven, CT plant that produced the Gun That Won The West closed. The venerable Winchester line of guns is no more, despite a heroic two month effort to find a buyer.I have a hard time believing someone will not try to resurrect the name, but perhaps it's best to let it die away. Certainly, it should not suffer its name on inferior product lines. We've allowed other great names, like Spencer, to become extinct.But what exactly killed it? Just another American manufacturer unable to compete?

1	I typically don't read Antonia's propaganda pieces, so is she holding up the UK as a shining example of dental health? If so, I suggest that she ask a typical Brit to smile, so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion.

So baby how about those poor folks in Britain pulling their own teeth because of lack of healthcare? Get real.
0	Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?	You are just playing dumb, right? There will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment PER INSURED. Their pay will not be cut. There will be fewer of them PER INSURED. Initially the absolute volume will increase.

1	so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal?!?!? what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional? oh yeah, i forgot, the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want. so screw the will of the people, just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism.	the california legislature--the people's elected representatives--have, over the last two years, twice voted to legitimise same-sex marriages in california.  that's in the last two years, not eight years ago, when the odious, unconstitutional prop. 22 was passed.  gov. schwarzenegger vetoed it both times, saying--contrary to the usual the 'activist judges' complainants--that he preferred the court to decide. which it has. tough titty.
0	'would the french accept people singing the la marseillaise in english as a sign of french patriotism? of course not,' there are so many flaws in this comparison it is unbelievable. firstly, there are virtually no french citizens for whom english is their first language. second, english isn't the national language of the us, nor is it a language that evolved there. a better comparison would be la marseillaise translated into bretagne, or translating 'oh canada' into french.	george bush: 'people who want to be a citizen of this country ought to learn english, and they ought to learn to sing the national anthem in english.' what i would like to know is when w, the 'decider', is going to learn english?

0	We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead	This is wrong. You yourself find "mental existence" to be "sacred' in a way. There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try :p
0	it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes.	saw a great article today by michael bloomberg (yes, that michael bloomberg), about where the illegal guns used in crimes come from - mainly from the states with weak gun control laws. this is unsurprising to most rational folk, but yet we still hear the pro-gun clarion call to have no new gun laws, etc. so here's the article for all to read: stop spread of illegal guns from states with weak laws - cnn.com
0	Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that "incipient organ" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying "what good is half a wing." Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does "fully functional" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.	(6) Natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds, but actually tends to preserve the present kinds, since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no "survival" value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning.

0	But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.	you see, the thing is that not everybody agrees with some of the theories that usually accompany evolution (including Big Bang, abiogenesis, etc) that try to answer the question "how come existence".

1	Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, "....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically." you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence.	Somewhat so. If grammatically meant "with proper grammar", then there would be no need to say "grammatically correct". I have also heard the term "grammatically flawed" or "grammatically incorrect" both of which would not comply with the definition presented. Grammatical (adj) means "of or relating to grammar". Grammatically (adv) has a similar meaning. Neither is meant to definitely imply correctness. Michael Moore is still a piece of feces. emoticonXHoho  emoticonXKill all terrorists and those who support them

1	After Rump Limpballs and his XXXXX followers started calling me a "Feminazi", I was granted a license to call TeaBaggers TeaBaggers.	Two general observations: 1: Must you use the pejorative "tea bagger?" or does the simple mention of the term somehow convey some mystical argument defeating power?2: Regardless of how unsavory the means I don't think desperation prompted grave robbing equates to asking for a handout. Presumably the Pilgrims merely took a page from your playbook, declared keeping warm to be a "right" and simply cut out the gubment middleman.

I have to ask: have you actually read what you just quoted?I know that must sound rude, but I can't for the life of me see the connection with the rest of the thread - or indeed any of the points you're trying to make. Non-random (or environmentally cued) amounts of variation is not the same as directed variation. Nor is there any reason to believe that these genetically regulated 'responsive' rates of mutation did not arise, originally, as a random mutation themselves. You're clearly very excited about something, but I can't see what it is; sorry!

0	The same ones you've been told about, what, a few dozen times now? :)A small exerpt:	And what fossil records can you show that one species of animal has evolved into another species of animal?
0	False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself.	Any random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system.
1	Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.	For instance; they have many pages dedicated to the history, derivation and definition of the word "species".

And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?	Lacking substance as usual.... Whether Jefferson said it or not is not the issue. The topic of this thread is "15 myths about gun control" But you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual...
1	It's also hard to convince a rational person that something is so if there is zero evidence of its truth, but then you wouldn't have any clue about that.	People have been trying for centuries. It's hard to diss the truth. Jesus is Lord!
0	well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.	So, in other words, you an intelligent actor weed out the programs that don't look like anything that resembles a living thing. Then you keep building up on the programs that look most like life. You are the creator of this cyber-universe! So much for 'natural' selection!

Good question plotter...Plotter: "when did he create all the other planets, when did he create all the other stars and comets?"Gen. 1:14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so. and XQ, what stories are you talking about?	Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize (lie) what God actually did, for God was done with everything then started again. THe stories don't parallel each other they intersect.
1	What facts? The article above your post is replete with documented facts. Are you in denial? Have you even read the article? Are all of your responses knee-jerk, shoot-from-the-hip defense mechanisms?Pay attention.	What fact's? Fact's of propaganda Yea thats it. I see more whining on the Conservative side then the libral side.  Not saying the libral are not whiners Both partys are whiners.
0	Are those thousand people directly and immediately threatening to rape you, to kill you? Up close and personal? I will retain my right to self defense. I bet you would, too.	If killing were an act of justice I could take upon myself, I would probably kill about a thousand people already. It isn't how it works.
0	Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers? That's a statement of faith.	In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there is nothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science.
0	Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree. Correlation is not causation.	What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates.
0	So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning!	There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the "right to keep and bear arms". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. > (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any "natural" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or "self-evident", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed "natural rights" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea > (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.
1	Oh...come on Steeeeve...you know Bush is actually making it worse. After all, it is happening on Obama's watch, and we have got to have someone to blame. Bush was the president...let's just blame him. emoticonXRolleyes	So we should be ok with him making it even worse in a year?
0	So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence.	So what activates genes?When a gene product is needed, a signal from its environment, not an emergent property of the gene itself, activates experession of that gene. In otherwords, it's the environment, stupid." Pg/ 52
0	i am familiar with both men; and my posts sound very lockean, which if you really knew locke you would know is true. remember previously in this thread (that is, when you were travelling these parts as 'bhbcu64') where i said that there is no right to control one's body? or where i said there is no right to suicide? that is locke 101.	matthew, though i doubt phyllis is aware of either man, her posts sound more like rousseau than locke. if one reads rousseau, one can clearly see why that frenchman was hitler's favorite philosopher. check out what he says about the 'general will.' and, no, no one here is being called a hitlerite.
0	Not entirely true. While we can't disprove that God created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. For example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old.	The reason for that is, that Creationism can never be proved or disproved.
0	gitmo is a media darling. nobody talks about abu ghraib. and it is still in operation see what the obama admin thinks about closing that one. not a fucking word. enjoy the grandstanding.	'3. gitmo' i happen to think closing a camp that engaged in torture and the prolonged detainment of 'terrorists' without trial was one of his best choices so far. but as you said, you've missed being able to disagree with me. :-p
0	?? What are you trying to say?Science is knowledge, all knowledge, that is, anything we find to be true. There is no other "truth" out there, if there were, we'd be omniscient.	This is their words as nothing science has "proven" overturns anything the Bible says. Most scientist agree is not proof. Many times most scientist are wrong.
0	Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.	No it is not. Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly. I'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable, adaptive variation.
0	Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation.	tell me this and ask as many questions as you want, I can answer and truthfully.
1	This is often called: 'talking out of both sides of your mouth'	I did not say that atheists were not caring people. I was just trying to show ...... Atheists constantly mock, belittle, and ridicule theists and their God as if that validates their nonbelief and is perfectable acceptable to be vile towards other people.
1	glad to know you bring spelling into this. Shows where you are in the argument. And where did the life saving question come from?	So STEEEEVE;How many lives have you saved, thru MTM, CPR, etc., huh ? And at least I can spell a major faith properly; even a three lettered one.
0	Why is saying that many things conflict with the well being of Society at large and bans them to the disappointment of those who endorse such activities. Consider rape, murder, incest and sodomy as good historical examples of such taboo activities, taken by you as an inditement of all gay people JSD ? You seem to take any moral stance or argument I make very personally, as if I'm accusing you of being those things. You work very hard to read into, demonize and condemn everything I say as if it is intended as a personal attack. You really need to work on that.	And here you go AGAIN AA. You are indirectly comparing gays to rapists, murderers, incest and sodomites. And you wonder why "bigot and homophobe" come up so much in response to your posts? Do you really think you're smarter than everyone here? This is the reason we need moderators. YOU, sir, are really already getting nasty again.
1	Some slightly earlier history shows that Clinton wasn't quite that worried about Bin Laden. In 1996, the CIA had Bin Laden pinpointed on a ranch in Afghanistan. It needed permission ONLY from the Clinton White House (not Congress) to vaporize it - it was in the middle of nowhere. An official from the "United Arab Emirates" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!	President Bill Clinton was very worried about Osama bin Laden well before 9/11 and HE GAVE EXPLICIT WARNINGS ABOUT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND TERRORISM TO GEORGE WALKER BUSH AND HIS PEOPLE DURING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIONS. Bush and his people blew Clinton off. Thanks a lot, George Walker Bush!
1	yes. your point? have you? as poor a typist as i am, and as full of mis-spellings as most of my posts are that is the best you can do? i must be slipping.	have you been to nigeria??? egypt?? north africa?? and for christ's sake spell ridiculous correctly.
0	I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few.	Heh, well we'll see how long they can do it.
1	Steeeeve?Do yourself a favor and stop fantasizing about my opinion, 'mmkay?I don't believe you are like that.This junk you do where you refuse to address what I DO say and make up strawman arguments gets you nowhere...I understand you're getting angry, but YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...Let me repeat that. Hopefully it will sink in?YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...With that said, I return you to your delusions...	Retract her opinions? You know, your comments make me and probably symbiote angry. I suspect we are both going to go outside and yell "kill bush"!
0	really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?	how could they be 'accurate' and be wrong? there is nothing 'less accurate' about that, it is wrong! i think you've been reading too much george orwell, you've come up with new speak for science.
1	Not only is everyone in agreement, which scares me enough, but Parcum even agrees with me. This is really shocking!!!! :)	They obviously didn't help us at all.

0	my dear, i can see the wood for the trees. no-one expects perfect parents, but no parent should dictate school policy. and this guy was a bad example.	maybe you should subtitle this thread: the right to a school with perfect parents. but that's not public education. you sound as extreme as the people who don't want gay parents in their schools. well, go ahead, dear. have fun tearing each other apart.
1	i love how scumbarge doesn't give a rebuttal to this. he knows you have him by the balls.	if it's really that much, i should have heard about it by now. but maybe, just maybe, i haven't looked hard enough. why don't you post what they have said, since, apparently you have and must (therefore) know where to look to find it ;)
0	I wouldn't say most cjurches, because you cannot prove that. There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks.	Joe, this is no surprise....This Pope is a very conservative one and like it or not the Roman Catholic church and most churches believe the sexual act that gays commit a sin as they would any other sin.........The church believes love the sinner but hate the sin..........That will never change my friend
1	no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!	well its not...aren't you more concerned about those people that have a abortions after unprotected sex? no i'm not. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? what result? describe to me the result and we'll see if its the same. well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either..

0	And this is a terrific breakthrough. My partner and I are coveered by my company's health insurance, and the state of Connecticut honors our Civil Union. That being said, I still have to pay tax on my partner's health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union.So it has to be marriage. Full and without exception.Civil Unions are not enough when we are treated differently under the law.	Here in New Hampshire, not known as a bastion of liberalism, Civil Unions passed the state legislature this year. I am now covered under my partner's state sponsored (he's a state worker) health insurance. We are grateful.
1	###!! You're seriously advocating allowing kids to take guns to school? Don't you have enough greiving parents already without giving kids the option to shoot out a disagreement?	Gun Free School Zones ActThere's nothing reasonable about this law, this law has even made it possible for the worst school massacres of the 20th and 21st centuries to take place, by ensuring all the victims couldn't shoot back.
1	And yet after investigating for over a year, our inspectors agree with me, not you. Hmmm.	Anyone with an iota of common sense knows that he had them, he used them and he hid them.The problem is that you are a complete XXXXX.
1	But what makes them any different from ant hills or beaver dams? skyscrapers are natural because humans are a part of nature and they built them.	Um, no. There are many man-made substances that are not found in nature at all. And, I've never seen one of those naturally occuring skyscrapers or Ford F-150's.
1	I don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one.	How many people would be capable of doing that to themselves?
1	Sorrowfully, you are so right. That's exactly why we have all "suffered" for 8 long years. Sheer. . . . .no I refuse to write it!! :)	Think of how dumb and uneducated the "average American voter" is, and then realize that half of them are dumber and less educated than that. I would bet if we required a satisfactory score on a politcal knowledge test to vote for our leaders, we would see an entirely new crop of politicians in Washington. Ignorance is bliss, and by what I have seen on the news yesterday and today, there are an awful lot of happy people out there.
0	personally i can't stand it when someone uses 'lol'. it's usually used derisively when politeness suggests that leaving it out and responding politely is in order. personally i'm surprised at this thread. the author apparently didn't read the faq.	the one main thing that i see a lot is lol. do people think that is acceptable to use? when you start substituting u for you and r for are you just look stupid, but everyone seems to understand and use lol frequently.
0	The human collective is the authority. One major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.	this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air
1	why would you think such an absurd concept. corporations don't cast a vote in an election do they? why not?  does a corporation have a mind of it's own that it may look to it's interests in it's attempts to influence legislation? no, it permits individuals to overcome finance laws and exercise greater influence than is normally permitted for an individual. should your car have rights? you pay a tax for it. how about your house? pay a tax for that also every year.	if that's the case, then we should alsdo eliminate corporate taxes and only have 'natural persons' pay taxes since corporations would be taxed without representation.
1	Ok, so you utterly missed the whole religion vs. faith part of the discussion, got it.	it takes faith to believe that a complex organ such as a pancreas or an eye could arise from randomness..
1	I see -- in your opinion is it is "illegitimate", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance.	Problem is that the right to marry is not a clear constitutional right. It is a right that has been interpreted by Courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process.
0	The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)	the laws of logic are non-material, universal, unchanging, and absolute
1	Did I mention premarital or adulterous heterosexual sex?  I think not!  As usual 'big' boy is putting words in others posts!  Was better when I was on his ignore list..for about five minutesemoticonXConfused	so, premarital heterosexual sex is not a sin. nor is adulterous heterosexual sex. nice to know that gansao......
1	ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation.	i think a better question is what preserved their life for so long? it is the mercy of god that upholds and preserves people in this life. it is the sin of human beings that is responsible for death. this is not correct. god does go 'out of his way' to keep everyone alive. besides that, god would never be presented with any kind of problem, much less a problem of overpopulation. good grief, to suggest that the god who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is, frankly, as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the bible that condones, allows, or supports any and every abortion that occurs. that is ridiculous.
1	Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.	Atheists do, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they represent science. You haven't gotten in over your head – most who post here don't know much about science. TQ doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that I don't. There's a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. Many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel “intellectually fulfilled”, to discredit religion. Some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn't written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. Michael Ruse and Bradley Monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. Religious authors, practically too many to name. William Dembski, David Berlinski, Phillip Johnson, Cornelius Hunter, many others. You would do well to read anything by any of these people. Far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like Richard Dawkins. He's become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. Read “The Edge of Evolution”, or “Darwin's Black Box” sometime. :)
0	And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother.	I think Ludacris brings up some very important issues that others would rather pretend aren't there in favor of an easier point of view. It's much easier to sit and say, "don't have an abortion" than to stand up and say "here's how I will help you so you don't have to have an abortion".
0	I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child.I fully intend to have children in the future, including through adoption possibly. When I do I will love them with all my heart and put their needs above my own. I'm not going to do a half-assed job of parenting; I'll give it 100%.But not yet.Prototype:	Then I'm glad I'm not your future child. If you can feel nothing remorseful from having your baby killed at all, then I pity the children you raise. I would think you'd have more heart than this.
0	Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read.	In regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer. Therefore, we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author. This is undisputed.
1	i doubt you know enough about carl bogus speedy defense of bellesiles and his dependance on a flawed study by loftin which was also in turn defended by jack rakov who later apologized out of embarrasment? want to take a shot and drag this farther off topic and embarrass yourself and star gazer and any other adherents? you well know you are in the wrong ballpark as has been pointed out many times on this very board. keep clutching at straws you will never get enough to build that strawman. beating a dead horse is bad enough...all 9 justices agreed the right was individual in heller.	madison rejected all changes to the constitution that he thought would weaken the federal government, including its control over the militia. as he rhetorically asked, 'for whose benefit is the militia organized, armed and disciplined? for the benefit of the united states.'[91] he was willing to respond to the fears of the antifederalists by granting the states, in carl bogus's words, 'a concurrent authority [page 74] to arm their militia.'[92] the result was a single sentence with a clarifying preamble: 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'[93] chicago-kent law review
1	There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value.	You're wasting your time Phyllis, these spiritually dead empty suits are just too shallow to appreciate the value of a life they can't communicate with verbally. How pathetic they are not to appreciate that with all of the value and potential they see in themselves, that at one time they were exactly like these unborn children with the same mental existence they now claim is justification for their extermination.
1	How about he pulls it out from under the Ramadan tree and unwarps it rather than your Hitler Youth moment?	Consider it a bonding opportunity.

0	There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out.	This is the old viability arguement, but it just doesn't hold up. It means that as our medical technology has gotten progressively better, and a premature baby can survive outside the womb at earlier and earlier stages because of this, the point at which it is unethical and/or considered murder has gotten earlier.
1	i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin? if he is god, no one had to die for anything. he could blink his eyes and everything would be as he wanted!	no, god loves me so much that he sent his son to earth to pay the penalty for my sins. past, present and future. i have eternal life now, based on the promises in god's word. i also know that, like a loving father, god disciplines me to get me back on track and in line with his will. i'ts true that god loves you, but god cannot accept you the way you are now. if and when you discover who god really is, then you will understand that god changes people from within. god wants you to come to him, but on his terms, not yours.
0	Or that they tend to be better prepared, or even less willing to accept help from others or get breakdown cover. That's the trouble with these kind of stats, the interpretations are pretty open to debate.	Do you know what conclusions the person drew from this?What conclusions do you draw from this? That people that own guns are less scared? Or just nicer people? :)
0	And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?	Or by not granting them to the child you are endangering the rights of the child carried by the woman. You are giving her a dictatorship.
1	i'm surprised to learn that you have the slightest idea about biology. also, your spelling and grammar is ever so much better in this post than your posts in another thread. how many of you are pretending to be a poster named vt?	a little lesson in biology told me that when the sperm meets the egg, it makes a zygote... that means that fertilization has occured... which means a life has begun (even the medical field and our government agree with this). thats an embryo... a human being... a sperm cannot in and of itself become a human being unless it meets the egg.

0	Actually, my wife and I discuss evolution all the time. She's an evolutionary biologist. She did feel as if she had some duty to watch the show, just to stay on top of the sorts of things being said. She just has a low tolerance for willful stupidity. Which I totally understand. :)	LOL Kronus - my wife and I don't sit around the dinner table debating evolution either, she was shocked that people could be so intentionally ingnorant and zealous, supposedly in the name of Christianity.
0	No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se.	I can understand your point that, in the absolute, metaphysical sense, we can never be 100.00% sure of any of our knowledge. Just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world, doesn't mean that it is 100.00% certain, just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00% (say, 99.9999999%). The greater the amount of evidence, the closer that certainty is to 100.00%. That 0.0000001% leaves room for obsurd scenarios - such as that an omnicient being is causing us all to merely imagine our reality, or the scenario of the movie "The Matrix". These can be fun to ponder (especially in a social situation after a few drinks ;) ), but no one takes them seriously. If anyone did seriously live by the idea that the world may not exist, they would quickly do something stupid and die, or change their minds.
0	Well, it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material. That's rather impressive. Again, irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution, regardless of you trying to create that association. Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated, well that only shows one thing, namely that you are dishonest.	and some people were saying "They are just that close in showing how life could come from non-life."
0	Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?	Ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced. There was no real biological basis for the prejudice. We know that interracial diversity is biologically sound. Sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples, but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships. You are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity. This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce. This trumps homosexuality's abilities two fold.
0	No it didn't, there's no suggestions for how to enforce background checks to stomp out straw purchases. Stop offering non-solutions.	Not if it were enforced and a suggestions for how the law could be better enforced are given in the report.
1	Anyone can "give consent". The issue is wether the parson is old enough to make that decission. I bet the children Michael Jackson raped gave their consent. Does that make it "allright"? Are the kids "mature enough" to take the consequences of those actions?	I'm not going to say "oh, well since the girl who got pregnant is still very young she should have an abortion", because if she gave her consent to having sex then she should be old enough and mature enough to having a child.
1	oh really? then please provide me with several links that prove i'm an idiot or shut the fuck up! considering you only have 30 points i'm not too sure just how much you could possible know about anyone on this site? come on dude! you're a troll and everyone knows it... stop your trolling, grow up and hang with the big dogs... if you can't then close your fucking troll account and go bye bye.	must have clicked dispute out of habit of disputing idiots. after looking at your posts, i'm not sure intelligence is gonna be your best argument... although, once the window came up i at least had the wherewithal to make sure my position was correct - ie - support = pencil and tag = pencil rather than say i support pencil in one and pen in the other...
1	oh yes those horrible wicked gays that will distroy families and consume morality as we know it.	religious zealots don't believe evolution or biology have anything to do with humans. that's because we are supposedly one step below the angels, a special creation by a very special god. everyone except those wicked, godless gays, naturally.
1	Anything that doesn't fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong?	Of course this doesn't show numbers of couples who are 'separated' (and possibly sleeping around or with multiple people, but still legally married to one individual.

0	i think the the p. bagatti is the one that found the burial caves in 1873, not the bagatti who was working in the mid 40's. i have unable to get a copy of the original manuscript the leadership u describes. i think it is only in italian though. i am surprised that such a  'key discovery' from the 19th century is kept so quiet except by claims of an evangilical web site.	easyrider -- that site mentions an archaeologist named p. bagatti. i'm not aware of an archaeologist by that name. i suspect the author may have meant to say 'b. bagatti,' as in father (or padre) bellarmino bagatti (professor, studium biblicum franciscanum at flagellation, jerusalem).

0	But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]	I would disagree here about this, in terms of the pro-life view. It's not that mental existence is irrelevant ... quite the contrary; in fact it's the reality that there will SOON be mental existence that makes it matter. I don't think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being ... a human that is human by pretty much anyone's standards. So I suspect that the big difference here is that pro-choicers are more "in the moment" in terms of the way they view the fetus, and pro-lifers are more "long-term bigger-picture" in terms of the way they view the fetus. Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human.
0	Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said "minimal or negligable physical damage".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the "peg" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.	Are you sure about that? Heterosexual sex goes as follows: The female's one millimeter hole gets a one inch hidious peg rammed into it, tearing the hole until it is big enough for the peg. Wow, how...not physical damaging. I think lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.

I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child.

1	sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want.	just out of curiosity, please pick out your best one (just one, your best one) alleged contradiction from the gospels and let me see if it holds up to close scrutiny. please include the scriptural passage and your argument or evidence to support your claim.
0	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will	When you decide to sin - you are making the decision, not God. He is just allowing it to happen. So you do have free will to make your own choices, but God must "approve" those choices.
1	if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said.	well, that depends what far fetched ideas someone has i imagine.  so lets get this straight; you say it is fine to pick and choose which bits of the bible you accept, but it is not okay to try revisit passages in the light of other knowledge from outside the bible? i just ask because i find that an interesting position to adopt.
0	Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.	I will not turn this into another debate that often comes up with this issue. But for the sake of clarification can you tell me if you believe it possible that the rights of the being's inside the mother are being infringed upon? That is, when do you deem it worthy of protection? (I won't debate this, I'm just curious as to your view).

If they were to expand the method to include more and more taxa, they'd see the Noodly Appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Ramen.	“We thought that the idea itself was important, that this is a really powerful approach to a very major question,” said Funk, “but we thought there was no way in the world that we were actually going to get statistically significant results.” The reason for his doubt was the incompleteness and lack of uniformity of ecological data. “There are all these species out there and so few of them are known in intimate detail, so any kind of ecological characterization – through no fault of ecologists – will be limited in accuracy and precision,” Funk said.
0	And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?	Nice link. It destroys NATO's higher death rate "argument", and proves my point.California = "toughest gun laws" = 9.8 gun deaths per 100,000 population.Florida = lax gun laws = 11.1 gun deaths per 100,000 population.emoticonXRolleyes

0	Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.	Originally Posted by Galileo Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.
0	Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment, and how much gun control is legally allowed. Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.I see absolutely no comparison between the two.	In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with. Roe v. Wade and Heller do share some striking similarities.

Both clearly stated that they did not support gay marriage.

0	Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.

Your whole post proves nothing because it doesn't show a causal relationship between gun control and mass murder. How come Sadam Hussein was able to kill so many of his subjects although gun ownership was common among the Iraqi public? I suppose we could find a way to blame all the world's problems on gun-control. Even this pro-gun website admits that you can't blame the holocaust on gun-control. "The simple conclusion is that there are no lessons about the efficacy of gun control to be learned from the Germany of the first half of this century. It is all too easy to forget the seductive allure that fascism presented to all the West, bogged down in economic and social morass. What must be remembered is that the Nazis were master manipulators of popular emotion and sentiment, and were disdainful of people thinking for themselves. There is the danger to which we should pay great heed. Not fanciful stories about Nazi's seizing guns." http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcnazimyth.html

0	This is simply false. Rock can be folded under pressure. This has been proven by lab experiment. However there are many features in sedimentary rocks that cannot be formed quickly, for example, fossil trackways.	* There is abundant evidence that many of the rock strata were laid down quickly, one after the other, without significant time breaks between them. For example, preservation of ripple marks requires rapid burial, as in the Flood (e.g. lower Triassic rock, England). Folding of sedimentary rock without cracking or heating, such as at Eastern Beach, Auckland, New Zealand, suggests the folding occurred before the sand and mud had time to turn into stone, consistent with rapid deposition during the Flood.

Actually, the title is a little deceptive, however I have noticed that one verse in his new song "Runaway Love", one of the verses brings up something relevant on the abortion debate. Verse 3 goes of the song, I noticed goes:"Little Erica is eleven years oldShe's steady trying to figure why the world is so coldSo she pops x to get rid of all the pain'Cause she's having sex with a boy who's sixteenEmotions run deep and she thinks she's in loveSo there's no protection he's using no gloveNever thinking 'bout the consequences of her actionsLiving for today and not tomorrow's satisfactionThe days go by and her belly gets bigThe father bails out he ain't ready for a kidKnowing her mama will XXXX it all outta proportionPlus she lives poor so no money for abortionErica is stuck up in the world on her ownForced to think that hell is a place called homeNothing else to do but get her clothes and packShe say she's about to run away and never come back."I know its not completely relevant to the abortion issue, but it is very relevant to the lives of little girls living in poverty and being abused. I would like to know what your opinion of the verse is.
0	I believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions. So why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response?	Scientifically, human may mean Homo Sapiens, but there are other methods of defining humans. One of them is their capacity to love and to worship. Worship is not seen in another animal. Some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed.
0	So ban guns? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head. Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately. Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database. I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime.	Furthermore, law abiding citizens can sell their guns to criminals in private transactions. In these transactions, the purchaser is not required to pass a background check so how can the seller be sure whether or not the buyer has a criminal history?
0	sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well.	the car crash analogy only goes so far. the consequence of a car crash is merely damaged property.  not all unwanted pregnancies are due to unprotected sex or irresponsibility, contraception can fail. humans are sexual beings, they have sex (something some posters may understand some day if he ever have sex) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precautions. the puritan expects everyone to be celibate until marriage. not all people get married. also, unwanted pregnancies also occur within marriage. i totally understand the concept of being responsible, but the consequences of a pregnancy or an unwanted child can be devastating to a woman or a couple. it is naive, simplistic and yes, punitive, to simply conclude that the woman should 'face the consequences.'
0	Making up numbers again georged? Care to post some links to this data?In 2005 Israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. As for the 28 billion in 2002...I know that is wrong. I recall a 200 million dollar thing, but I don't know if it went through.The rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so.	2005 publicized aid to Israel was $5-billion, about average for that country. That doesn't include $28-billion in 2002 to fight terrorism, with subsequent yearly amounts classified and not for publication. The US also picks up about 50% of Israel's ongoing deficits and trade imbalances in the form of Israeli debt for Israel to maintain a small positive payment balance for trade credit and public confidence purposes. Pull those numbers from their primarily transactional GDP and problems would quickly appear cumulating with that spiral effect.  Over 30% of present Israeli GDP in public service is difficult to fund from domestic tax revenues, presently the highest in the free world, without incurring abnormal debt. Israel is riding on the coattails of US elastic debt policy.

1	is this the pro-sodomite woman talking here? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be?  where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. one more time now, preppy: where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. so go preach that trash to someone who's buying it.	this is what easyrider doesn't understand. your story was jesus's whole point. though actions of love we will know god. easyrider and his kind do not know jesus. i actually feel sorry for him and pity him he can not see jesus in another human being and is so addicted to the bible, and the teachings of the false god paul, that he and his kind have made it their god. they are trapped within the confines of thier own teachings. jesus said only as a little child can you enter the kingdom of heaven. see the world though the eyes of a little child and all things are possible. don't let the fear based rantings of easyrider get to you. remember love is always the answer.
1	Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't "really" a christian.	Once again, my point was that evolutionists contradict each other.
1	well geeze pyg...i knew you were a bit itchy but i didn't know you hated gay people! i also didn't know you owned the 'internetz!' you must be related to al gore...how much did he soak you for his invention, lol? i don't know if you realized it but i'm gay too. yes indeedy little pyggy, shall i go back from whence i came or am i safe here with you? you seem to know what a 'rick roll' is so i'm impressed...'cause i've never heard the term.	i think the real problem is that rick roll is officially dead. i mean, a guy like obama using rick roll? god, i thought it was gay when youtube did it, but now obama... what's next, osama sends a rick roll to iran? i feel bad for the trolls who have been using this to get massive lulz. all this shows is that obama is a gaia bitch and should gtfo my internetz.
1	but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing. doesn't it. so you think that just because you enter a debate half-way, you can still give an uninformed opinion? weren't you the one ready to laugh at me? i won't laugh at you. i am only saddened by your personal attacks. yes, repeating yourself. i know what they say, you know what they say. i don't agree with them, on these points. answers in genesis are 'right' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being 'selective' in the information we use; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes. i disagree with them. do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution? i bet you've been very selective here too!	i see you still think my goal in life is to go back and read every post you ever made. lol as stated in answers in genesis, creationaries have to admit to speciation. otherwise the ark wont hold all the animals. somethings got to give, which do you want to give up, no speciation or the ark. lol
1	Just because you fail to realize what the article says doesn't make what you said true. Since you seem to like logical fallacies can you reconginze which one you just committed?	But no link was ever established. We have been over this over and over again. I really hate having to beat a dead horse more the once. Give it a rest….redundancy erks me.
1	You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?	Did your thought process ever include the question: What choice does the "victim" have? Does the instinct to survive exist in the helpless? The being that is totally dependent on the being that brought about it's existence becoming a victim of that being entrusted with it's safe keeping
1	No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure.	...so where does cancer come from? Isn't that 'cells producing something other than what they are'?
1	And once again (s)he rambles on while responding to nothing said in the prior post. At least you're consistent in your irrational hate speech. BTW, the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all. Except in the mind of paranoid hate mongers, that is. emoticonXGood	"The Sword of TRUTH" SCOFF! Why must truth be accompanied with a tool of violence? Only the religious possess the shameless audacity of claiming exclusive possession of truth and backing their claims with VIOLENCE. Religion / christianity is negated by the very FACT it is violent and indeed "lunatic"!
1	oh yeah, that's right.... i forgot ;) i'm getting dementia already ;) well, i guess that if i don't make it to heaven (due to all the liberals i've tormented over the years) i'll be so busy shaking hands with all of my friends that i wont have time to worry ;)	you are an agnostic. you believe in heaven? if you believe in heaven, would you not think that the being who created heaven would have planned for the number of people who will be there? don't you think that the being would have made in large enough for all the people that will be there?
1	So everything that other people say on a website or in a book is just and opinion? And everything you say is a fact? Nice how you've got things set up.	If I cannot question and receive specifics I do not consider it a fact. You can read all the books, cruise all the websites. but indeed they are just other peoples opinions.Show me the documented proof!!
1	And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?	Just when you are ready to come get my guns...... remember!
1	No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off.	Come to that... given that all humans start out as a single cell, that's definitely false.
1	Waxy, don't you have better things to do than cruise gay threads. ;)	Unreal. So, barring a really lame alusion to animals apparently engaging in incestous oral sex, your only justification for this is personal opinion. Did you miss this part of my post?Waxy
1	Right on! The Obama administration is a colossal financial disaster. If he doesn't have another trillion dollars to XXXX he can't do anything. Tax and spend - that's all those liberal turkeys know how to do.	You're right, how silly of me to think that Democrats or this buffoon of a President would have anything to do with a BUDGET PLAN or even present a comprehensive budget; they have failed to do so now since 2008.Another illustration of the massive failure of leadership the Democrat Party and this President represent.
1	So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?  The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.  It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.	volcanoes do more to contribute to global warming than an unchecked industrial society. toxic gases, giant ash clouds, thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there's anything approaching an eruption, it's not a pretty picture. molten rock isn't the most environmentally friendly substance you'll ever encounter.
1	Did you go to college, Trebor? You might want to look up how "pedophilia" is spelled. LOL!! Then you can go have a beer with Orion and watch his head swivel.	I can well believe Orion saying that you used a source that said the Rabbi's condoned pedaphilia, and denied the holocaust.
0	I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.	Ten gunned down in southern Alabama.At least seventeen gunned down in Germany.On Monday, March 9, 2009, some twenty-seven human beings were living, breathing, going about their respective businesses.They are no more.
0	mind if i ask if you drive yet? if so do you have any points on your license? 2mph seriously isn't a huge ammount and neither your speedo or the mobile cameras are usually calibrated to be that accurate.	i have no issue with speed cameras, they only photograph people breaking the law. want to not get a fine? don't break the law. it's that simple.
0	mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?	yes, it would be like teaching children...which doesn't seem to be that much of a problem. fair enough if they had to work it out for themsleves, in which case you would probably find that exactly the same thing we have now would have happened, but why not make it clear form the start. our forefather's weren't more stupid than us, they just hadn't discovered as much, but if they had god to dictate the history of what happened why both with all the parables. or have i got the wrong end of the stick and you think that we are discovering things closer to the truth and the stories are just a primative culture trying to work out how the world is as it is.
1	but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm...	from what i understand of christianity...you're gonna burn, buddy. sorry, but that's where i think you'd fall according to that. personally, i don't think so. i think if there is a god and it's anything like i picture, you'll be fine. question, what are the seven deadly sins you've committed?
1	Wow, you are high on Christ...Scary...I haven't seen this addiction up close emoticonXRolleyes	For your info, and as I stated before, this world will not last much longer in its current state. That's why the book of Revelation gives me such hope. The redemption of mankind will be completed, sin and its curse will be gone, and I will be able to see the God of all creation.
1	let's say that the law, based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data, decides that some folks are inferior to other folks, and thus less of a person? you know, if the law said 'because you are black, you are less of a person than shomeone who is white. you shouldn't be upset though, all scientific data suggests that you, because you are black, are truly inferior to those who are white.' would you think, because the law said so, that a black person was in fact a non-person?	in this case the law and the science are in accord. the law can treat the late term fetus as a person because it has developed to the point where sentience is verifiable.
1	They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world.	I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature.
0	No it doesn't. That's why Darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory. Those who don't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand. Fittness is not a reference to big and strong. It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.I'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.You've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong.	Of those that are beneficial, the chance of actually being passed on is minimal considering the animal bearing that mutation has to actually be the biggest strongest animal to pass on its genes - unless it is lucky.
1	lol bias dysfunctions. i'm surprised you know such a long word. pity you don't know what it means. i can't blame you... being a retarded ignorant white woman. you don't even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs. go back to cleaning the house. worse is that you don't work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but don't pay taxes. you're better how?	'umm... what the fuck are you talking about again?' 'reincarnation? walking on water? no different than hitler?'-perhaps i should of compared him to 'jones' instead. just mocking your own skewered belief , thats all. pity you have not figured me out beyond your own bias dysfunctions , then you would hear the tone in my voice for what it is when i type it. ok ..........................your turn...............
1	Oh, sorry, I didn't think that was a serious answer. Thanks.	How about a slap on the wrist and a suspended three day jail term?
1	And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....	It´s funny, there are gun-restrictions in Sweden and I have not been rounded up and exterminated yet. Must simply be a matter of time...Honestly, Those arguments are totaly worthless.Compare the rate of criminality and murders in US and those of the average contries with gun-bans. Where do you think it´s highest?
1	what? don't they have boyfriends? i'm just amazed that they don't design all women shirts so that they come off easy. hell, they invented the easy access bra ;)	xd i don't know if that's insulting to him or a compliment. i just find it amusing. the place i work at is only half fun i guess, tops off only. and you'd be surprised how many girls have fallen off stage trying to get a top off >_< the new ones usually. who didn't know they needed certain shirts that come of easy...
1	oh yeah, you got me. bigotry and hate are major turn on for me. you could use a good lay anyway. muah. ;0	you prefer me i am your target since the beginning. when i took a break from cd and came back you are so happy that you message me like 5 times begging for me to let you be my ally i still have them but i am not going to copy and paste them here because you will cry like you did with hellno. cheap words from a false witness that doesn't know knowing but satanic claims.
1	yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!	no one knows anything about the constitution so how do they make claims that abortion is constitutional?
0	Apples and oranges. We're not demanding that they have abortions either.	Slave owners weren't demanding people own slave, simply that they had the option. I wouldn't call THEM pro-“choice” either. Some choices are wrong.
1	were it so simple. for the agents to 'freely assemble' among us they, or their superiors, must conclude that we are some sort of threat. would that make you feel loved? on a side note, i'm always surprised at how 'conservatives', normally so worried about government waste, take such a waste of taxpayer dollars so glibly. fbi investigating kiss-ins? joining subversive 'terrorist' xxxx biker groups?	if they're just hanging around amongst the minions, that's perfectly legal and not spying. after all, freedom of assembly also applies to federal agents. :)
0	my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.	As usual, the Brady campaign is lying. The senate voted by a narrow margin to attach the riders to the manufaturers liability bill. Then the senate voted and the bill as a whole was defeated 90-8. Even if it HAD passed the senate (which we knew it wouldn't) it was expected to be killed in the house. Here is an article on it:http://www.news-miner.com/Stories/0,...993580,00.htmlThe decisive moment seemed to be during the later arguments on the bill. While they were debating whether or not to ammend the bill to include the assault weapons ban, Feinstein (d-california) claimed that the assault weapons ban legislation "has reduced the proportion of banned assault weapons traced to crime by two-thirds."During final arguments before the completed bill was voted on, Craig (R-Idaho) and Young (R-Alaska) got up there and completely shredded her numbers. IT was made very clear by the end that she was a liar. God, I love Cspan!Of course, the Brady campaign has labeled this a "victory". They can have all the victories like that (where nothing at all happens) that they can handle. Teh house is still expected to pass the gun makers protection bill WITHOUT the riders. Senate leadership suggests that it can be fully expected to pass in the senate "the democrats simply don't have enough votes to stop it".
0	i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager.	the thoughtful atheist, full of skepticism but fearful of the possibility of the existence of god and a day of judgement, may wish to consider the prayer of the skeptic, as follows: o lord--if there is a lord, save my soul--if i have a soul.
1	i'm shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic.	dude, is that what you do? a large amount of people disagree with you and you act 'shocked' at how that could be possible? grow up.
1	That is an interesting fact, how come I have never heard such a thing..maybe a link is in order and not a stormfront or the like link please....actually I have listened to gangsta rap...Easy E, Snoop, NWA, and so many others, in fact they are in my truck right now.. imagine a redhead "whitey" takes enjoyment in listening to all kinds of music.. hmm I also have Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Nat King Cole, and while we are at it I have music that I adore from Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Turkey and so many I cant list them all... whats your point?I would hardly call rap the decay of the 90's, apparently a lot of people listen if they are making money....I wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past? Maybe that would explain a lot.	What i really find disturbing is why you choose to ignore truths and facts....did you know that the blacks that were brought here from Africa were the criminal and the mentally deranged? 90% of blacks here today are a product of them.....think about that for a week.....have you listened to "gangsta rap" lately? it is the decay of the 90s....of society....but they keep getting richer!!!!!!!
1	You mean the Conservative tilting Supremes donot know the law ? You want to tell them that ? emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken	Lately, I'd argue that the Court doesn't know the law. How else can you explain some of the more recent controversial decisions. emoticonXRolleyes
1	with you it's pretty easy, we just assume it's all BS, works every time.	but it's hard to tell which he's trying to do when you can't tell the difference between brilliance and BS.
1	I'm actually in the Detroit Subs with one kid in a Blue Ribbon High School and two in college nearby. And yes, the mayor's got the bling goin on in his wife's city-leased Escalade.

1	From the Catholic Educators Resource Center...Yeah...I am sure there would be no myths in there...sure you're right. emoticonXRolleyes	You should go back and learn the truth about the Crusades!* Crusade Myths THOMAS F. MADDEN What is the real story of the Crusades? As you might imagine, it is a long story. But there are good histories, written in the last twenty years, that lay much of it out. For the moment, given the barrage of coverage that the Crusades are getting nowadays, it might be best to consider just what the Crusades were not. Here, then, are some of the most common myths and why they are wrong. Source:: Click HERE
1	On the bright side, it appears that the Rapture will solve the Social Security financing problem...	Err, no correction necessary, I just felt like saying Enrapture.No the dooms-day will not be on the arrival of the asteroid, that has nothing to do with it, the dooms-day event will be a terrible event, even for the innocents, wrong on both accounts. emoticonXGood
0	No, neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. Legality and morality are completely separate things.	Sigma...*sigh*...Lets start off getting one thing straight. Are you suggesting that legal makes moral?
0	Logically incorrect. One can as many red balls as one likes, and still only have one green one.	If it's all that endless and limitless, there would have to be an endless, limitless number of planets exactly like this one.
0	Yet it is the only source I've seen that counted the incedents in which a gun was used in self-defence, but nobody was injured. I could assume that all of your sources and Ians only count occasions where one was injured. According to the source, they'd 91.7% of all times where a gun was used in self-defence.	But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves. http://www.pulpless.com/gunclock/165476.pdf
0	But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins.	I completely agree with this here. We need to teach kids how to think, and unfortunately, ID doesn't seem to deal with thinking.
1	Proof for a non-event? What century did your purported non-event supposedly occur, Einstein?	And yet you spiritually challenged turkeys still can't provide proof that there is no resurrected Krishna.
1	you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright. 'sickening' is a good way to put it.	what bothers me the most about 'organized religion' is the sheer hypocracy. i was taught that god instructs us to question authority, yet 'the church' brainwashes it's mass followers to not ever question authority, especially theirs.  i was taught that to not utilize the brain i was given was the unspoken sin of all sins. yet organized religion forces it's followers to do just that, to not question authority, pooh-pooh science, and never think for themselves let alone following their hearts.  i cannot of good conciense as a parent allow my child to be subjected to that type of abuse. spiritual abuse, abuse of the soul. how dare anyone expect me to do that to an innocent child? how dare anyone allow this to continually happen, even encourage it's existence is beyond compassionate comprehension.  but the fact that it does isn't shocking, it's just sickening.
0	See above. A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence. Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked, rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in.	The definition of deter is "To prevent or discourage from acting, as by means of fear or doubt". A lock does nothing to induce fear or doubt in an attacker, all it can do is slow them down. As said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place, so their effectiveness is highly questionable.
0	I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification.	No, it is you young padawan learner... that has been mislead, some of the most famous and noted Darwinian Naturalists such as Crick, Huxley, Lipson... and others have admitted to their own discredit that the entire theory of evolutions rests on chance, here... but here, lets burst that bubble for you a bit more:
1	No. What the doctor was doing was going to church. He was not a monster. He was not a "sicko." He was a murder victim.   What his murderer did was murder.	He was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. In terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. I don't condone it, but I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. It wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.
1	Not the same thing at all! Most gay pride floats are moade of crate paper and glue guns. Not gold. I think you have stratched this one really far. Nice try, thanks for playing. Try again soon! Wow, nicotine cravings make me a mean person!	I'm sure all the money for decorations, supplies, and city services for gay pride parades down through the years would go a long ways toward it too--what's your point?
0	So have I, since I know that evolution has and does take place. But I catch it from both sides because I don't believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness.	I have actually been called a heathen because I believe in evolution. I have been called ignorant. This damned well gives me the right to call someone mindless if I want to. The mudslinging occurs on both sides, and don't think I've never been on the receiving end of it.
1	never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming.	that was complete non-response. you totallly made up that there was some 'other speech' pushing a 'socialist agenda.' that's what the sarcasm was about which was evidently lost on you. show me this fabled 'lost speech' baron.
0	Why do you oppose gay marriage? The traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride. The wedding is what is sacred. What you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well. You have no valid reason to oppose it either.	A homophobe according to Websters Dictionary is one who has an intense dislike or fear of homosexuals. If someone is opposed to gay marriage and does not dislike gays or fear them, just not wanting to extend marriage to gays they would not be a homophobe.One can be opposed to gay marriage and not intensely dislike gays or fear them.
1	but do you ever question it for your self? or are you content to just show up .. and let someone else tell you what it all means. the rcc has made , by their own admission, mistakes in the past are you suggesting that it won't happen again? are you suggesting they never made a mistake in their interpitation of the bible? if so you might want to tell that to gallileo remember him ? he was burned at the stake for telling the rcc that the earth went around the sun!	the rcc has priests and i follow its teaching as set down by jesus christ through his first pope his disciple peter.............
0	Right. They can never show how the belief in their deity is not a textbook case of the special pleading fallacy. (Pretty funny after all the hubbub earlier about double standards...)	Really? Let's see you show that the God that you believe in is that God.. and that this God even exists outside the imaginations of the mind?
1	So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?	Then go away. If you have no interest, then why on earth are you even here to debate?Besides this, you're trying to put killing human beings on the same platform as animals or organic plant life. I'd seriously suggest you reconsider your views on what exactly is more important. You cannot put those things together, they mix about as well as oil and water.If the court or parental unit is not allowed to interfere with abortion plans, does the mother have the right to kill the child? Who is she to interfere with her child's life if her own parents can't make her live with a baby she can just give up for adoption?By the way, only 1% of abortions are made because of rape. If it were my decision, I would outlaw abortion altogether for the other 99% who have abortions irresponsibly and save over a million lives. Don't get me wrong, I do feel for victims of such crimes, but a few thousand hardly outweighs over a million. And they don't even have to die! They just have to live with a baby for a few months, and they can get on with their lives! It's more of a chance than the baby will get otherwise.
1	oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?	i am using the same definition. however, i do not place confidence in scientists.
1	How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?	Monkeys don't generally have problems with their private parts being functional.
1	So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?	It would also make what appears to be immediate "jumps" in the fossil record -- which fits in nicely with what's been reported. It's also a natural, orderly process that plays out possible variations on a theme, making the organism not inherently stupid and clueless, but more like a creative artist.
1	So you advocate religion not because it is the truth, but instead because it gives you comfort and security? The opiate of the masses eh?	How sad it would be for me if I believed that this is all there is.........When you die there is nothing else.........I truly believe that a lot of atheists find religion on their deathbed...........At least I hope that is the case............
0	I think you are entirely correct. From the page VOR linked:	I think it's nonsense interpretation developed by people who were afraid that if they fought for guns as valiantly as they did for free speech, they wouldn't receive any donations.
0	Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, "the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God," and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God?	It's a false dichotomy that some critics of religion have cast religion in by saying that submitting to spiritual authority and thinking/reasoning are going to be juxtaposed.
0	i just love how you call it a baby and not 'contents of the uterus' or 'product of conception' or 'fetus'. the truth is, that was a child.	i aborted my 6 1/2 week old baby and i'm extremely offended by comments that portray me and women like me as 'violent'. i had my abortion for my own personal reasons that have nothing to do with any of you, and should not be any of your business.  steve, nobody was saying that you have to give 100% of yourself to your cause or otherwise you don't really believe in it. what they are trying to say is that you come on here and spout your opinions but you don't really seem to present any indication that you do anything in your personal life to confront abortion. i would like to call myself a revoluntionary feminist but i feel like that would be lying because i do not feel like i do enough for the cause to call myself one. see the point?
0	I think you need to answer the same question I asked the other guy, who is God?	Then who would create this very very clever being? In that case there has to be someone even more clever. Or maybe it really was god that envolved from the apes. ;)
1	Oh . . . please be gentle with me. Whew! :p	I neither said that nor implied anything of the kind. I'll be gentle with you and assume that you simply misinterpreted my statement.
0	Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under "evolution" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose "science" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea.	plus there are so many other sciences that are lumped with evolution,

0	Your partner wouldn't happen to be a guy, would he? As for your Christian friend, ask her to join the fray. I'd like to ask her a few questions, such as:Who do you say Jesus Christ is? If not Lord, God, Savior, and Jewish Messiah then she is on the wrong page.Ask her if people need Jesus Christ for redemption for their sins?Ask her if people should repent of their sins and turn from them?Ask her who the Holy Spirit is? If not God, then she's on the wrong page (note Acts 5).Ask her if the Bible doesn't say gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.)? Those will do for starters.	A very good friend of mine has a Masters in theology from an accredited institution. She is also hosting my wedding to my partner in the fall. She is a christian but she doen't share your beliefs.
0	ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out.	i suspect that those statistics are harder to find and harder to determine (since, once a person is dead, there is much less motivation to prove him innocent). nevertheless, various sources mention a number of people who have been executed despite probable innocence. here is just one of numerous sites that i found with a google search. this site (a few years old)claims that 25 people in the last 25 years have been executed despite probable innocence. http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/25casesdraft.html anyway, i don't think there is a formal procedure to establish official innocence after death. i don't think the mechanisms are in place in our justice system to have a trial for the dead, so we can only look at the evidence in the cases that people have privately pursued.
0	Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.	the problem with your statement is that freedom of religion is specificly enumerated in the bill of rights. government recognition of marriage is not. as i have told mathew s on numerous occasions, you are free to put forth an initative, in your state, to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages. you are also free to vote your opinion on such initatives, but so is everyone else.

1	maybe he'll unban himself on the third day (or was that three days and three nights...)	No, that logic doesn't hold Biblical mustard (or is it muster?!?!?!).Remember when Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross, and all kinds of people said things like, "He who saved others, come down off the cross and save yourself, so that we might believe" (that's a paraphrase). Well, Jesus Christ didn't come down from the cross and save himself: he allowed himself to die. Allowing himself to be banned from an internet discussion form seems trivial in comparison.So I'm starting to believe that the poster here named Jesus actually is Jesus Christ! emoticonXAngel
0	now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is.	well, since you're the only presenting that argument, i'm glad you recognize how stupid it is so we can drop it. prove that. give evidence. anything. you said that someone who claims harm without evidence is a bigot. show us your evidence or admit to being a bigot. and lest you make a foolish claim, allow me to point out that the fact that you personally don't like how something is changing does not mean that's it's been harmed. you'll have to do better than that.
1	i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented.	it is kind of funny how abortion has to do with a woman's body. and yet, if it was left up to the state: congress: women hold 81, or 15.1%, of the 535 seats in the 109th us congress  14, or 14.0%, of the 100 seats in the senate and 67, or 15.4%, of the 435 seats in the house of representatives. in addition, three women serve as delegates to the house from guam, the virgin islands and washington, dc. only 15.1%... so that means that 276 men (51 senate/ 225 congress) will be needed just to pass a law that has to do with a women's body...and if its something that could be bad for a woman and/or unfairly good for a man then they can get no where near the amount of senators/representatives needed to supress it.... [66.6666-15.1 = 51.56666--(535/100)(51.56666)=276]  (http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/of...rs/cawpfs.html)

1	And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am.

I didn't have to CHOOSE to be heterosexual. It's the natural inclination, unlike homosexuality. ;)
0	I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it.	I stated nothing; I merely asked you (or rather marc) to consider the options impartially and assess the scale and plausibility of the conspiracies each entail. Factor in the explicitly advertised intentions of the I.D movement and related sites such as AIG, and it's not hard to pick a winner.

1	Why would anyone want to get to Heaven? Archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . Thanks but no thanks!	Without question my largest beef with God would have to be the fact that according to the Bible you need to believe in God in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. The reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in India than if you are born in the US or Europe. The Indian culture is that of Hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the US and Europe which is primarily Christian. That means being born in the US or Europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a Christian and believing in God. Would the be at all fair if this were the case? My answer is plainly and simply no! It is idiotic infact. If God existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. His system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. Furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to God's expectations. If not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. God in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but I just don't see spelled out in the Bible.

0	we do......most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time. For example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other "ancient" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand. Of course evolutionists will come back and claim "erosion" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called "Hidden Archeology" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the "wrong" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false.	If Literal Creationism is indeed true, why do we not find strata with species from all eras mixed together?

0	That interpretation is fine except that God says, "I WILL make a helper suitable for him." He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.	Okay, here is how it went: God made the animals. He said,"Hey, Adam needs a helper." He brought the animals to Adam to name. He couldn't find a helper for Adam. He then took a rib out of Adam's side to create Eve. This was done on the sixth day. God created them both on the sixth day, Adam first, then Eve out of Adam's side after he had Adam name the animals.
1	Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.

0	yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected.	supersport, do you believe in a creator that purposely doomed human beings to inevitable genetic destruction? after all, if what you claim is true, human beings have no choice but to 'devolve.'
1	LOL. Glad he didn't come across a dung pile while he was fashioning us.

0	i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught.	considering that there's little new information and reasoning in any of these debates, i find it surprising that they keep coming up.

0	Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.	but why does this generation get to bypass the same authority that every other generation before them submitted to with their parental oversight ? how is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ? are you suggesting that 13 year old girls are mature enough emotionally to make such adult decisions about getting an abortion ? and if so, do you then also believe that a 13-15 year olds should be allowed to adopt a child ? or to enter into a contract to purchase a home or car ? because those are also adult decisions and it doesn't seem reasonable to me that we should allow them to slide on emotionally damaging decisions about sex or abortions and then insist they're not mature enough to participate in other adult decisions. kids need consistency in order to grow up to be responsible adults and by your way of thinking, you will just add more confusion and insecurity in an already difficult time in an adolescents life.
0	No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance.	Meaning, I take it, pure chance, accident, or just plain 'luck'.
0	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.	then surely you can't explain away why enzyme a and co-enzyme b are separate compounds but work together to produce another by-product.

0	ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?	whether the anglican church is apostolic or not is a matter of opinion. the roman church started as an imperial church. its claim to apostolic succession is dubious as well, given the nature of some of the pope's in the middle ages, who were clearly chosen by outside influences. the independence of the church of england may have started with henry, but anglicanism is more correctly dated from elizabeth. the priest was and is well aware that i am an anglican, though we are of the same faith, christianity. so was his predecessor who i also received communion from. deviation from catholic dogma is common in the catholic church.

'yes.' 'i love you.' 'oh.' 'do you?' yes.' 'you love me.' 'i love you.' 'let's hide. in this cave. while the war goes on. and die. alone. in the rain.' 'wait.' 'what?' 'how do we die alone? we're together.' 'oh yeah.' 'i love you.' 'i love you too.' my god, i wanted to tear my eyes out. so instead, i just stopped reading it. ;)  who wrote timeline? i just finished the pelican brief, by john grisham. what an amazing book.	it's between grapes of wrath, for whom the bell tolls, and timeline.
0	But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves.	According to this, there are 1,531,764 crimes stopped by guns this year (and it's not even the end of the year yet!). It also gives a reasonable explanation of why you don't see this on the news every day. It also says that legal gun owners account for almost 0% of all gun crime. So if you want to ban guns, 1,531,764 people will get killed or injured, and you'll only take guns out of the hands of those who don't even commit gun crimes.

1	Oh, oh, and don't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment's text, which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions, in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state.

There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that "UK will be Islamic", "Sharia Law for UK" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London.

They are hardly "taking over" )."muslims are taking over the world" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!

0	So you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate Brown and let him stop the bill? You suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide.	Put a fork in it. Socialized medicine is DOA.The possible scenarios that could get the healthcare bill made into law are both suicidal moves that will cause the Democrats to become Washington outsiders in quick order. They are:1. Get the HR to pass the Senate Bill without any changes. This will be suicidal to the most liberal Democrats and the most Conservative ones, because the Senate Bill is a neutered version of the House Bill.2. They drag their feet on certifying Brown until after the reconsiliation process occurs so that they maintain their supermajority. This option is ever worse than Option 1 because it exposes every Democrat in Congress for the unprincipled b@#$%rds that they are and will cause a firestorm against them for years to come. If there's one lesson that crooked politicians should have learned by now, it's the lesson of Watergate. The people have long memories when it comes to blatant attempts to throw elections.

However, when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death, it is not worth the risk.In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois, there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death. I think that constitutes a serious problem.	Every system has its flaws. Does that mean that we should abolish every system?

0	Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!	That all changed after he became a radical gun activist!Charlton Heston's civil rights credentials are seriously sullied by his bigoted and homophobic remarks and his attacks on racial minorities.

0	Yeah, see this is the old "gateway drug" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a "gateway" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something "harder"? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.	The marijuana addict will work, buy weed, smoke it, work to buy more. AND THEN, you get to the marijuana addict that decides to try crack because all drug addicts hang together and so someone will try to get you to try new stuff. Now you do crack...then herion...then you are dead. Good job stupid junky.

0	I think you might want to check your logic here... As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit. As you are, I am not terribly fond of policing someone's personal habits, but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries, assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored. This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem.	If drugs were more accessable we would likly have far less crime and far more drug adicts.

0	it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about. do you mean 'having faith' in actual things? if so, then most definately. although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place, it can also be a fantastic one, and seeing that (as i'm an athiest) gives me some kind of 'faith' in the human capacity, society, etc (where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god).	i agree, there is no place for religion in the world today. but would you say that there is place for faith? i find that atheists often (not always) lack the ability to trust, making it difficult to have faith, even if it is just to have faith in the human capacity to redeem itself once is a while.

0	The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section.	Both Thompson and McDonagh treat the child—the woman's own daughter or son--like an invading stranger intent on doing harm. They make the mother/child union into a host/predator relationship. A child is not an invader, though, a parasite living off his mother. A mother's womb is the baby's natural environment. Eileen McDonagh wants us to believe that the child growing inside of a woman is trespassing. One trespasses when he's not in his rightful place, but a baby developing in the womb belongs there.

0	daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation.	that just shows how nutty it is. using your argument, someone could reject all scientific theories because most of them are wrong: apparently even yec are in this sense more rational than dawkins. the claim that faith is accepted mainly because people are told to is very dodgy. religion seems to naturally arise, although there are many theories as to how and why, religious and otherwise. think of religion like morality: the idea varies, but seems to exist everywhere and often seems to appeal to the same things. it is often 'taught' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally: indeed, a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed, and this requires a more direct and deliberate move: thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs.

1	You should use the same quote when whining about use of partial quotes, and not introduce different ones. Nozza made a false assertion and was refuted with his own words. You introduce a different false assertion and fail. Epically.	You should use the entire quote rather than cut to attempt to prove what you aare about. "When defending yourself in Australia you must use equal force. THis means you must use the SAME weapon as the criminal. So no baseball bat V knife. Once you locate the same weapon as the armed criminal has you must then use Reasonable force to bring him down. This means you are NOT allowed to kill him and once he is down you are not allowed to touch him again. Now if you have 2 criminals both with different weapons you must use the weapon one has on that one then change for the other. The catch 22 is if he has a gun you are screwed as using any weapon to defend yourself is ILLEGAL." Comprende?

0	Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?	I am curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for owning a gun. Data from the FBI shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when they use other weapons for defense. I would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use. On a related note, as was recently confirmed by the SCOTUS, owning a firearm is an individual right. I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.
0	Because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people.	Bingo. This is spot on.

It's highly unlikely that he could accomplish a repeal of DOMA as President.

And regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria, are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon? The bacteria works on a microscopic level and couldn't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on. So your example is both fallacious and moot.
1	well if I don't get an answer here I'll just spread it around the whole internet. Fine with me.	Well, answering you seems to be a waste of time.You ignore/reject any attempts at explaining the things you clearly do not understand, and youlater bring up the exact same things that you have had explained to you as if the subject was never broached before.You are incorrigible and uneducable.
1	i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?	wouldn't it be nice if you didn't overuse the word oppress. if you really believe that gays are oppressed then believe me you ain't seen nothing in the world as yet. try looking at some countries in the world and you will see what oppression really means.
1	Nonsense. Just look at all the great things that the Dark Ages did for Europe!	I think the risk from the Christian Right is less the theocracy, but that they will stifle scientific development and education to the degree that the US loses its major asset, innovation. We're already seeing this with regard to stem cell research. This isn't to say that ethics should be disregarded in science, far from it, but if the US raises a generation of kids who think science is satanic then the possibilities for development are going to be slim.
0	i'm surprised i agree with you on this. the only point i'd add is that the force feeding should only be used while the person is undergoing therapy to fix the underlying problems.	an obsessive fear of gaining wait - also sprach wikipedia. they have a fear of gaining wait - by force-feeding them, they shall learn that it will not kill them to be healthy. same, by the way, as with people who go on hunger strikes.

0	Why should every pro-lifer have to be an adoptive parent in order to have credibility?This is akin to saying that every pro-choicer should have to have an abortion -- or at least face that choice personally -- in order to be a credible pro-choicer.	Since only abstinence is 100% effective you are in effect suggesting that unless you're prepared to raise a child, don't have sex. A return to controlling women's sex lives through negative social pressure is the objective of the pro-life movement, not saving babies. If every pro-lifer was an adoptive parent I think they would have more credibility.
1	No but it will be funny to see what sex tapes this tramp did too....	Will the gay pride movement again try to make a bug issue of out of a beauty pageant's view of gay rights? We'll see!

1	Interesting. It seems that you like to get your news from Aljazeera.	Half the 120 mosques in Fallujah were destroyed by US air strikes and tank main battery fire.
1	You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:  Question: Was Stalin a communist ?  Answer: That's what he said he was.  Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.	so stalin didn't actually practice communism (not that anyone has), but really just used bits and pieces to further his rule and such ideology is not communism but stalinism. so in essence, stalin wasn't a commie.
0	Yet another application of a different meaning of the word in an effort to group everything in science that you don't understand and won't accept under one word.	You could even have (4):4. Geological evolution, explains how all the geological features came to be.

0	What exactly has bin Laden gained? The last I heard, some 75-80% of his top leadership is dead or in the slammer. With "friends" like Bush, who needs enemies? How would you like to be on the run or living in a hole for the rest of your natural days? That's the life that bin Laden lives today. He has to communicate to the outside world via courier and donkey. And tell me again, how bin Laden gains by killing Muslims? I don't quite get that part.	Please, where has daewoo praised allah?  The problem is alot of us are not athiests. I dispise all organized religions. That's not the point though. Getting a religious fanatic to argue without religion is virtually impossible. Neither Daewoo or anyone vor calls a liberal has done so.  that's questionable. Bin Laden has gained quite a bit from Bush's policies. thousands of recruits, a terror playground, a huge amount of soft targets. If I was Bin Laden, I'd vote for Bush. After all, the search has all but stopped for him and the US is being bled dry in a number of areas under Bush's leadership.
0	If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional, then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind.	Do you not understand what is currently going on?The ruling on whether the California state constitutional amendment was enacted "legally" was ruled on by the courts.What is discussed above is entirely separate.To say something brief to get you up to speed, our state constitution CANNOT violate the federal constitution.So if Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment, then Prop 8 loses.Whether or not Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment is the question that is currently being examined.

1	Interesting.... have you ever been to a schoolyard recently? I think the "taunts" are more directed at gays. Like "f@ggot" and "fairy". What taunts do you get on a daily basis? What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo.	That's not what I said. You're misrepresenting what I said (which is dishonest on your part) and then basically accusing me of not having honesty in your next sentence ...Why is it dishonest to want marriage and govt. separated? I've told you my stance--that's what it is. I think the real problem is that you just enjoy being belligerent and doing things like calling people "weasel" and "dishonest" when you yourself misrepresent like you did above. I have a better idea--drop the sniveling "you're-a-weasel" playground name-calling antics and start stepping up to the plate and debate the issues. If you think my stance is not a good one for the country, give some reasons. So far all you've done is basically given the equivalent of "that-would-never-work" and that's pretty much it. That, and a bunch of play-school-type insulting.
1	I knew the mangling of Jesus's teachings would be forthcoming, and entertaining. emoticonXHoho   And of course lying about what I've said is just par for the course. Standard stuff, nothing to compare with trying to make Jesus out to be pro-cruelty.	Well sure, he wouldn't. But I doubt he'd approach torture from the standpont of anything constitutes it, either. And if someone were concerned about what constituted torture, I doubt he'd pretend it wasn't a valid question, as you're doing.How do you know exactly what Jesus would approve and condemn??? Do you now do what fundies do and claim to speak for him? Jesus said some pretty rough stuff at times. He talked about people being thrown into darkess with weeping and gnashing of teeth, and being cast into hell fire.
0	But you are forgetting life-without-parole (and I do mean WITHOUT parole). With life without parole, there is also no recidivism.	I suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti DP stance. The rate of recidivism that produces dead innocent victims by paroled criminals far out weights the number of executed innocent men. fix the judicial system. Make lawyers and law enforcement accountable for the errors that lead to deadly mistakes. Quit making future victims pay for incompetence in law enforcement. Dead murderers do not murder again. Tugging at heart strings over the death of a murderer or the terror he feels on the way to the chamber gets no response. No joy, no sorrow.
0	They're going to say no? CA tried that. Tell me the last time utility costs were reduced by a state agency. It's a rubber stamp and nothing else. We travel in different investment circles. I don't know anyone putting their money in US long-term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40-year useful life situation. What's your take on the US economy in 5, 10 and 20+ years? Good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached? Enviros or not, if the return is there money always has its own way of doing things. Corporations are awash in cash. Liquidity has been the name of the game for some time, but there are always bridge buyers.	Wrong. My gasoline prices vary from day to day (especially so, lately) but the retail price of electricity only varies with pronouncements from my state Public Service Commission. The investment capital is available, but ill-considered regulations (particularly those speciously based on the Endangered Species Act) and nuisance lawsuits from the environmental groups make it impossible to employ that capital. For example, we haven't built a new refinery in almost 30 years although people are using more gasoline than ever; a group in Arizona has been trying since 1999 to get the necessary permits for another refinery, but they haven't yet been successful. You're changing the subject. I referred to societal compassion, not government compassion (which I agree is nearly nonexistent - see the Canadian health care system for an awful example of where that leads).

0	Not many women would say they had an abortion now, let alone back when it was illegal.It is an emotionally trying event. I can understand why she wouldn't for that reason alone. Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence, or it could be a combination of the two.	It's kind of funny that they claim this happened, but can't get the woman to come out and say it?

0	Of course everyone has some basis for their views. Not even denying that. However there are ways that using that "basis" most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example. There are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. All I am asking here is that Archie, you, JP, etc. own that.	And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples' lives as well? What? you don't do that? Bull. You can't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does. But by your logic, that would be imposing on them.Sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt. Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.
0	But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.	If when I was in the military, I had suddenly stood up and said, "Woah! Hey! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people."Should that be respected and I keep my "job"?
0	you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't.	all the laws in the world won't work, criminals will always be able to get guns. if they can't buy them, smuggle them in or steal them, they will make them. criminals have even made guns inside maximum security prisons. follow the link. gun-making as a cottage industry
0	Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.	"That may be true, but it isn't harmful so I doubt it really should be on the list."

0	Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing.

0	Yes because it is "officially" a life.Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life.If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option.	Let me get this straight. We can't force a woman to give birth if she doesn't want the child, but we can force the father to pay for the child's care regardless of whether he wanted the child or not? Interesting.

1	other than showing your ability to bold your false or irrelevant claims what was accomplished here? as for the date that the nt books were written, more importance could be given to those guesses if any still existed or if early christians could have refrained from changing the word of god. sorry current christians do it also so unfair to blame just the early ones.	yes, we do. and the truth is a person, jesus christ (john 14:6).  has any major truth concerning jesus' life, death, or resurrection in the new testament ever been shown to have been substantially changed or proven wrong? no!  if you claim otherwise, prove it.  one other thing: when were the books of the new testament written? scholars give their expert opinions: dating the nt too bad you're so steeped in denial over christ that you can't see the forest for the trees. 1 john 2:22-23: 'who is the liar? it is the man who denies that jesus is the christ. such a man is the antichristhe denies the father and the son. no one who denies the son has the father; whoever acknowledges the son has the father also.' jesus is lord!

0	Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.	Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A.
0	I'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch, and my uterus is perfectly healthy, thankyouverymuch (not that it is any of your emoticonXCensored business), and yes, I do plan to have a child in the future, and don't really care what you think about it.	It's nice to think that you'll 'plan' a child later but, life seldom works that way. I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery. I'd be ironic for another yuppy type who can't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt...and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there aren't any easily to be had here...since they were all aborted. Also, the older you get, the more health issues possible for the child.
1	And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.

1	so if right now, i ask god for forgivness, someone kills me, i will go to heaven by default? makes sense to me, i mean, i dont have time to sin...	Have you read my "signature" lately? By asking God for forgiveness of your sins, asking him to come into your heart and govern your life, and following His commandments, you don't have to go to hell. Everyone is a sinner...it's whether or not you ask God for FORGIVENESS and decide to CHANGE that gets you into heaven. Yes, gays go to hell. They sin and do not change their sinful ways or ask for forgiveness.
1	what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers, shotguns, and ieds? what's your p***ing away excuse for instances like these? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer. it's like a wolf in the chicken coop.	try looking up weapons as status symbols. school shootings are linked to semi-automatic and automatic weapons as demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt by the tasmanian authorities where following the ban on such weapons school shootings fell to zero.
0	And that part of the decision (not allowing for the woman's health to be taken into account) is why I do not agree with nor do applaud this decision (in fact I am rather disgusted with it). If you'd like to see a more concise view from me, you can see the thread that Another_opinion started here: http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/9678-mothers-health-exception-where-do-we-draw-line.html	Sorry I missed your thread on that. It sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother's death and or/complete debilitation (like paralysis), and I'd be much more open to that. But as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and SCOTUS chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure. I'd also add that because this is a late term procedure, if health is the reason to not take the baby to term, then caesarian delivery very well might be an option, in many cases.

0	third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking.	imo, your third degree about 'freeing willy' throughout this thread qualifies as the former. of what concern of yours is it that dono or anybody else for that matter was circumsized, circumsized their kids or believes in circumsism? i was circumsized, my son was circumsized, he'll probably have his son circumsized. i can guarantee you that no generation of my clan will ever mourn the loss of their excess foreskin. as far as we're concerned, it's dead weight, excess baggage. all it does is hide the purple helmet. emoticonxbanghead
1	While I fully realize you can't do math and thus why you consider it atheism, but post #96 and post #81 are not the same post. But then again, you were the one who argued that post 113 came before 106 so maybe you do think that complete failure to understand math and linear thinking is sane?	Yeah, and he's a legend in his own mind too. He rants and rages against us while never making even the most basic degree of rational sense, yet to him it's us who is wrong. He personifies the passage.I mean, in post 37 just above this one, he links to the same post of his TWICE
0	Well, "reasonable" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?	LOL! And 'basically'.. banning firearms (as often proposed by many democRATS) is 'reasonable'? Get bent!
0	when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore. 'fu** the poor' - mike moore. i put that together after a class in the mike moore school of movie editining 101.	lol, when did moore do anything even close to that? did he change anybody's word to make it as if they said what they really didnt say?
0	well i was downplaying your argument because really, pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body. ITS NATURAL! OBESITY ISNT!	Yes - and????? The post I responded to completely down-plays the impact on a woman's body. I am merely pointing that out.
0	i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site.	have to be careful not to over-complicate the page, but for once its sometimes difficult to tell whether a reply is in favor or opposition. great job otherwise, love the site.
1	Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the "normal course of nature", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die. What about heart failure? Sorry, no paddles of life for you. We're going to let nature take its course. Just like your beloved pope, nature is not always right.	Cappy: How sad that you are unable to get this through your twisted brain. The woman with the help of a man, determined a pregnancy. The natural course of any pregnancy is 40 weeks of gestation then live birth. That is the NORMAL, NATURAL course. A woman wanting to end that pregnancy at any point of the gestational period is going against the normal course of nature. The government, in such cases, in the interest of the continuation of the human species, should be able to assist these pregnancies through to live births and make adoptions easier, NOT enable murder.

One of your old buddies told me your moniker in other forums, aaronsongs. And You're right, my mother didn't do a very good job raising me as a woman.

1	So the BBC folks are frauds and liars? You really are an idiot aren't you? Piltdown Bird is a colorful way of saying it was a Piltdown like fraud.   National Geographic knew it was a fake and published the article anyway.  Of course you probably still believe in the original Piltdown don't you?  You probably believe the Nebraska Man and Haeckels speechless apes were real too.  There is an echo when you think isn't there?	'piltdown' bird, not piltdown bird. are you so stupid that you do not understand what the quotes around 'piltdown' signify?  i am calling you a fraud and liar because you continue to desribe it as the 'piltdown bird' not the ''piltdown' bird'. the fossil was found in china, not piltdown.

The suspect, identified as a 41-year-old doctor with personal and professional problems, is in custody in Fujian province.The victims were reported to be mostly first-graders. Three children died at the scene and five died later at a hospital, authorities said. At least five other children were injured.
0	I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.	Really??? You think most people would incorporate the golden rule? I don't think so--I think most people are willing to make a buck off of others (business ventures), land that job they want before someone else gets it, curse someone for cutting them off in traffic, get that parking spot before the guy coming around the corner gets it, or even get in an intentionally insulting dig to someone in a discussion forum such as this. The examples could go on and on ... I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule, but at close, honest examination would find that they rarely do.
1	No I think YOU are the imbecile. And it's great to see you follow your buddy EZ and his ways.. I suppose you've been training with him for some time now.. You're almost identical twins .. give it a bit more time and we won't be able to tell you apart.

1	I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too.	That doesn't even make sense. How do you help an abused young girl stay safe by making sure the abuser doesn't get reported?
0	This is my understanding as well. Interestingly, concepts only approximate that which they intend to define. Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding.	We take reality and describe it in our minds and thus form it into abstract concepts which we can operate with.
1	tennis? you're joking right? it's already been proven that women can take on a man anytime in that game! others not so much but tennis most definately!	i say yes so that feminists and other women who think they're equal to men can see that they're actually not. i would also like to see them play football, tennis, athletics etc. against each other. then they will really shut the f*ck up.
1	Oh but he is different in the mule's tiny mind. The Southern Baptist types are Christian and so uphold the mule's way of life, so it's alright for them to call for mass death.	I'm pretty sure this guy was removed from his position after the broadcast by the palesitinian authority. He's no different from the Southern Baptist types who suggest nuking the middle east.
1	No, the law didn't specifically mention gays, or dwarfs, or one-eyed pirates, or 6 toed individuals. emoticonXRolleyes	The quote you mentioned in no way justifies allowing people to refuse to treat homosexuals while forcing them to treat all of those other protected groups. I do not think that point was addressed there.
0	Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding "cold")	Define evil.The concept of evil is very subjective. If something is truly evil, then there must be an absolute concept of evil. But you will never come to agreement with everyone else in the world as to what makes something truly evil or good. What is your standard for determining what is evil?

1	You forget, that all those nice rewards? None of them are rights.	Using your logic you may indicate that we should eliminate cars, food, heating/cooling systems, chairs, stairs, houses, apartments, work, money, paper, plastic, and basically everything that we have on earth because somewhere people are going to die because of almost everything. You have to look at risk-reward..

If you spell it out than we can put this definition debate in context, and maybe actually get somewhere.	i don't recall saying neuro-electrical impulses were information . they are material and cannot be information.  if all matter was information what would we need books or language for? if you delete the hard drive on your computer does it weigh less?

Well now my gay and liberal friends have resorted to Pope bashing........so very sad..........
1	How about other religious theories. What about teaching about the sun god? I don't mean that they believed that, but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe. Actually let's also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the Earth and other massive objects. We should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe.	Do you support the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public schools?Yes because it is the flipside to science and everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe.
0	a drink. a drink. one or two. and what the hell does abstinence have to do with this? everything in moderation, yeah yeah. all that fun stuff. i get it. i wasn't talking about light drinking. i guess i should clarify but i thought you'd catch what i meant.	just because you have a drink doesnt mean you automically turn in to some crazy drunk... its called moderation... abstainence doesnt work... we know this because the bible belt has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country and what do you mean we won that one a long time ago? you realize that weed being illegal is more harmful than good... and i dare you to get into a debate about that because i have so many facts in favor of ending prohibition it will make your head spin
1	and your kids go to private school yes? so you want higher teen pregnancy, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases?  if you are disagreeing with my statement that you want all of those lower, then you are admitting you either want them to increase or stay the same. as you have railed against abortion, it would appear you're being contradictory. make up your mind. and yet they have lower rates. funny how that works.  no. in the seven years since introduction 620,000 or so european women have used it. so that's around 88,000 abortions a year. 1.2 million happen in the us annually. as the population of europe is around the same as the us, it's not a valid point. 88k to 1.2 million is nothing.  plan b isn't abortion. try me.	do you have any children? i have three. i've seen the sex ed classes that they've had. they don't exactly teach abstinance only, that's for sure. whatever. you presumed to know what i want and when told what i did want, you continued to presume. i can't cure terminal cluelessness. not at all. many european countries have had free access to abortion for way longer than the us. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1869009.stm their abortion rate is probably lower because ru486 has been available there for much longer than it has been here.  http://www.medicationabortion.com/mi...ne%20worldwide it's quite likely that the statistics are skewed by the use of ru486 and plan b, also.
0	your argument is contradicting how can seeing people naked ifnringe on your personal thought and the other not? also the right isn't to marry whomever neterosexuals want. the limits apply to everyoen equally just people have different preferences.	walking around naked endangers my right to innocent thought. watching little girls in the bathroom endangers their right to privacy. gay marriage does not affect anyone other than those getting married. if you could effectively prove that two homosexuals marrying each other would harm me physically or mentally, (and thus taking away my rights as a citizen), i would say you have a point. also, along the lines of what mach said, no one has the right to walk around naked. the law applies equally. same with looking at little girls naked. no one has that right. however, everyone except homosexuals have the right to marry whomever (not whatever) they please. only homosexuals are told they cannot marry other homosexuals.
0	That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb.	and al shots in the ten range. And in response to Zachvac i mean guns not arms (as in nukes) but im fine with automatics and such in the right hands.
1	So what do ya Say! Come On. Be reasonable! Do it for the children! Or don't we care about these children because they weren't hurt or killed by a firearm?	The National Safety Council's new report shows that accidental firearm-related fatalities remain at record lows, and accidents involving youths continue to decline significantly. Downward trends, also being reported by other sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.CDC reports a significant decline in accidental firearms-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1994 and 2005.

0	Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?	Can someone explain to me how Noah took mosquitoes on the ark? Those abominations need sitting water to hatch and develop. A boat being toss around like a toy is hardly going to have pools of sitting water. Plus what did all of the insectivores eat for 40 days? emoticonXBye
0	Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman.	Don't they get that the whole pro-choice movement is based in a desire to make sure that ever child is a wanted child?

1	i love when random myth followers talk about critical thinking :d	muhammad forced his followers to leave their families false he warned those who did not follow him, leaving behind their families, will be cursed by allah false in yathrib he banished and killed the jews who did not believe in him false - they tried to kill him. i wont bother wasting my time debunking the rest of your diatribe. needless to say, freedomfaith.org is hardly a repudable site. i see critical thinking isn't something you're particularly familiar with. not at all unexpected, i suppose.
0	You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.	emoticonXDonno how is that fair? basically your reasoning is "lets just give the christians the whole marriage thing, and let the gays get married at city hall by a 67 year old judge who probably doesnt agree with them anyways."i mean, what happened to the separtion of church and state? did we, somewhere along the line forget, that little document we call the constitution. it dosnt simply say "see bible"everybody should have equal rights. no matter your race, creed, or religion. if joe and bob want to get married, how the heck is it our place to stop them? and im sorry if it makes you uncomfortable to think of that, but unless joe comes to your house to shoot your dog, its not really your concern.and come on, im tired of all these ppl using the bible to cover up simple ignorance and prejudice.so why dont we all take a hop-skip-and- jump into 2007, re evaluate our morals, and get a clue. emoticonXGood
1	Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.	While things like this seem like small pro-life victories, they are really considerable and should encourage us pro-lifers that we are making a difference--getting back to a higher value of the unborn is our goal, and we must not let up.
1	Yes, but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper. Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that!	emoticonXFrazzled So .... you actually think the collapse of the Minnesota bridge is because of gay marriage??? Unbelievable. emoticonXDonno
1	So it's just fine if someone says "gay people are prone to force Christians out of their towns", eh? Interesting. emoticonXWowJust "typical English usage", after all ....	Jyoshu, some statements just don't need qualifiers. Some statements are obviously meant to demonstrate a common thread regarding a group action, but not to claim the ENTIRE group commits that action.
0	That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue.	The Bible falls completely silent on the issue of abortion. All direct condemnations on abortion found in the New Testament were quickly discarded as irrelevant by theologians. Christianity had it's chance at condemning abortion in the Bible and choose not to!For hundreds of years the Vatican supported abortion rights. Even it's most celebrated saints were not only outspoken supporters but blazed a path for theology to support it. And in early America, it wasn't rare for abortion services to be posted on Church bulletinboards. Again, these are facts that the pro-life/Christian-Con movement you never find out about. They would rather have you believe in lies instead for their political agendas.
0	i love how hamas apologists require showing idf abuses to defend their actions. pathetic.	very nice propaganda, siegfriedson. why don't you tell us about the terrorist activity that necessitated military activity that inevitably caused also civilian deaths. the shooting of the 13-year-old girl is a terrible exception and i think the officer should be severely punished (i think he was).  the point is that israel tries to avoid civilian casualties whenever it is possible, hamas and other terrorists target civilians on purpose.  here are the reasons for anti-terror operations in the west bank and gaza: list of victims since september 2000 suicide attacks just since january 2004 (doesn't include mortar and rocket attacks that happen on almost a daily basis): tel-aviv feb 25 2005 karni crossing jan 13 2005 tel-aviv nov 1 2004  sinai (taba hilton) oct 10 2004  beersheba aug 31 2004  ashdod march 14  jerusalem feb 22 2004  jerusalem jan 29 2004

You don't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you. I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry.	http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe....ap/index.htmlGood for the Spainards! Personally, I think U.S. conservatives have gotten too complacent these days--we need to protest like this more often. We've gotten to where we lay down too easily and let ourselves get run over too easily by immoralism. These people in Spain are showing great courage--U.S. conservatives could learn a lot from them.
1	Ah yes, adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others, to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy.	A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.

That's a good one.)
1	Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes   I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away.	**Sounds more to me like a bunch of right-wing, no-neck, knuckle-dragging, drool-soaked, self-righteous slope-heads don't grasp the offensiveness of racist and chauvinist and other insults applied to groups of people, so long as they themselves do not belong to that group. If I haven't made you understand already, imagine a well-known media personality saying what I've just said to you, right out loud, to all the world, but off-the cuff and for no reason. Just to be 'witty' about right-wingers.Next time a black sport or other announcer casually describes a mostly caucasian bb team as a bunch of string-bean honkies on steroids, we'll see what happens. Oh, you say that's never happened yet!?! Gee, I guess you're right about that. I wonder why not?ww

1	poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.	poet, have you ever heard of pascal's wager? just a random thought. not necessarily the best reason for belief in god. maybe you can look it up on the net.
0	hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill	i agree to the fllest extent. 'white' is only a color metaphor. in reality, the people in europe are comprised from 12 different 'races.' i can name my own; germanic, and celt, slavic, and dinaric(italian-greek) are others as well. each race has its sub-races. germanics and celts are expected to go exitnct in less than two centuries anyhow. i'm helping to speed up the process by not having kids!
0	Actually there is a better solution.   Mandatory male and female birth control pills, financial penalties if you stop taking. Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.	...to curtail abortions.Any woman who has an abortion for convenience only (not raped, no incest, no danger to the mother's life) shall have both ovaries removed.What do y'all think?
0	It is in the first place unclear to whom the "further harm" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different.	How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child.
0	oh yes i forgot to answer the key question: where does information come from. its a simple answer. from a local decrease in the degree of disorder. ie a reversal of local entropy. see adami for a development in mathematical and biological terms.	i don't care what the definition is...i can't even get you kooks to answer if information exists or not, even by your own defintion.
0	here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway.	like stem cell research, same-sex marriage and speaking in tongues? wait, scratch the last one, that's his normal speech pattern. i meant hearing voices in his head giving him direction.
0	The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary.	The dino would be to heavy to glide or fly with them if they weren't fully developed, and even then only a few yards could be gained when jumping off a hill, ect, and when not fully ready. the would hinder the dino by hunting, by giving it a larger profile, and something else to get wounded for no benefits in return.
1	reckon if a rock could think it would have a concept or two.	the problem with atheism is that man is material just like a rock. concepts do not exist in a rock whey should they exist in man? we are all matter. you can say we are more conplex than a rock, but that does not make a difference; matter can not accout for concepts. yes, www.carm.org is awsome thats an example of ad hominim - attacking the individual instead of the argument
1	every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make.	and not that i did either... hijacking? hijacking is the seizing of something by use of force. the unborn baby was forced to be there...not the other way around. but you don't have 100% personal autonomy and never will. is this really that hard to see? well those 'slave owning white guys' (of which not all of them had slaves and most of them knew slavery needed to be ended) founded your country and established the government by which you feel protects your 'right to abortion' or 'personal autonomy'...eventhough they never established this....
1	Dude, you only figured that out now? I'm disappointed in you. just joking. Everything he states has a hidden agenda.	What was it they said about statistics? Oh yes, I remember: "Lies, damn lies and statistics". I think Jaaaman's sources are agenda pushing behind a screen of figures.
1	wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights? well no duh but if i 'bucko' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i'm slightly different i'm not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality. and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay, accepted it and realized that other people aren't the end all and be all, that they'd eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn't the world maybe they'd still be alive.	umm... i think the infringement of gay rights is kinda what we're discussing here, bucko. what rights of yours are being infringed by not infringing the rights of gays? if you can't answer, maybe you should deal with that.
1	In other words you would wait until we were attacked again before doing what is required. If we vacillate and wait for the nuclear cloud it will be too late. It amazes me; utterly amazes me, at how strongly felt the left believes in the good will of bin Laden and the terrorists to clean up their act. Just amazing. But with Bush? Noooooooo. He's ALWAYS wrong and never right. Isn't that about it?	I'd rather be correct and doing the right thing to make the world safer. emoticonXCensored

0	There are in place control procedures for traveling with weapons. All he should be charged with, and I expect he will before this is tried in court is breaking the Airport procedures, or maybe they are FAA procedures which could imply Federal laws.   This guy should have contacted the Airport at check in to report each and every weapon he was traveling with. They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed. I must say that I'm somewhat alarmed at some of what is allowed if I put my terrorist thinking cap on. FAA News	Don't get me wrong. This isn't exactly a trip to Sunday school. You shouldn't accept packing an arsenal around in the trunk as if it were completely innocuous. It kinda seems suspicious like a primer colored Nissan Maxima with five guys wearing stocking caps sitting in a vacant lot at 3 a.m.........something's not right, but nothing is illegal.The guy should have been asked to leave airport property.Officer #1: "HOLY COW! GUNS! Arrest him!"Officer #2: "On, what?"Officer #1: "Uh......Felony something! Uh......Felony transportation of guns! No. Not evil sounding enough. Uh.........Felony transportation of AN ASSAULT RIFLE! Yeah! I've included the term "assault rifle" so it must be illegal!"Officer #2: "What about those guys over there in that Nissan Maxima?"Officer #1: "Oh, they look suspicious. We'll check them for legally carried firearms next. If we don't find any, I guess we'll have to let them go."
0	why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people.	what's the point in inviting a bunch of famous people? i say this as a huge fan of deniro's and scorsese's: a dinner party would be not be as intellectually stimulating than if you had, say, descartes and kierkegaard in their place. sure, they've probably a hell of a lot of stories and anecdotes which would prove entertaining, but they're ... they're filmmakers, of all things!

The bible has lasted thousands of years under the constant and unending scrutiny of being judged by archeology and every historical discovery in the middle east throughout that time. Never has it been shown to be fictional or false in any way so it has most assuredly stood the test of time yet your ilk continues to deny it can be the truth it has been shown to be with every new discovery.
0	emoticonXWowYou are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along.Asking "what they would need" is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place.A lot of "doesn't this look like ...", but that's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests. You see what you want to.	Hey, I wonder what they would need to see in order to be convinced of design. I think most scientists would admit the universe looks designed, so what would convince them that it actually is?
0	It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.	And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.

1	According to Genesis? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence? How about Darwin's On the Origin of the Species?	Anyone who looks at this situation logically should realize that at sometime in the past there must have been a time when there was less genetic damage in the genome. – and thus, longer lives. Can anyone think of time that this may have happened? I can! The Bible reports there was a time in the history of humans that lifespans were incredibly long. According to Genesis people lived to over 900 years old.
0	I did not say that violent crime "rarely" occurs, merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks. I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals.	Why? Because being the victim of a violent crime happens enough times for it to be a genuine concern. I'd like to see your statistics to show that violent crime rarely occurs, because the statistics I've seen show that it happens quite regularly.

0	i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management.	from an enviromental perspective, forest fires are crucial for certain species to survive. man made influences has created a situation where forest fires are too uncommon that certain species and plants are facing extinction. forest fires also serves the purpose of revitalise the forests and make them more 'healthy'. but as i said, this is from the enviromental point of view. you are indeed correct that uncontralable forest fires are hazardous for humans who live nearby (as well as property). as always, a trade-off must be made.

0	Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore.	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will

0	Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case.	The last guy who owned the gun legally is a good place to start. If there's a stolen weapon report, so be it. If there's not, we investigate certainly and prosecute if the law allows. Remember I support mandatory theft/loss reporting.
0	i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea. (from the science point of view)all humans are traced to monkeys from africa. from there they spread throughout the world. if it is not evolution, then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs? how come africans have a darker skin tone? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair? i doubt it is coinsidental, and no offense, but i dont think that a god did this for us. every person has a subconscience. in this subconscience we think of lesser facts. does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better? i believe so.	i am offering any of you creationists, christians, etc, the chance to prove me wrong. of course, to have this chance, you must also accept that i have full ability to argue with you. i used to be a christian, but after extensive studying and questioning, threw it away. do not talk to me unless you have a somewhat open mind to argue things. my aim is pikeman852003 my icq is 117686925 my msn is pikeman85@hotmail.com if you want to argue with me, add me. i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of. i have convinced several people to severly question or even give up their faith using reasoning and facts. argue with me at your own risk. i originally posted this on the old forums, then learned they were obsolete.

1	i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused.	the concept of a gay family makes me a little uncomforatable, but i can't formulate any logical arguements to support marrige segregation. by default, i am a supporter of gay adoption. any two loving people can bring up a family just fine. as for marrige, it began as a religious institution, but has been ingrained into american society as a cutural union. gay people deserve the right to recognition in front of the world as a couple, as a partnership. spicygirl is more uncomforatable with gay couples than i will ever be, and that will never change. i would bet money she hasn't figured out her sexuality just yet. that aside, there is no logical argument to deny gays rights. if you have one, i would love to hear it.
0	I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. Until then I'll remain skeptical. Let's remember that Democrats and liberals hunt. Remove that group and what's left? Something less than 20% of Americans that own only handguns.	Well insults. No I'm not suprised I wish I could put my hands on the pol on firearms ownership that put the % of dems that owned guns was around 46%. Rep. was around 58% and independants were around 52%. What I was supprised at was that way this person feels that the reason libs need to be armed is the defend them selves from a conservative government. Where as we beleave it is to defend our selves against any and all forms of government. And for a lib to actualy say that they were wrong about anything is a big step.
1	And because this man said it, it must be true? A simple appeal to authority.

0	I think bringing "emotions" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to "non-belief" would be irrelevant (and irrational).	however, my point is that emotions alone cannot build a case for theism or atheism. when such is the case, it is no different from a religion
1	We have a terrorist supporter among us, objecting to restrictions on terrorists! Why do you hate America?	So lemme get this straight. Terrorist agents, who have access to missile launchers, grenades, grenade launchers, heavy machine guns, and anti-aircraft cannons, all of which come from all other nations in the world...are going through the hassle of coming to America, procuring forged documentation, and buying civilian legal firearms that no army in the world has ever adopted as their main battle weapons?Did you eat lead paint as a kid?

0	i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it.	are you seriously claiming all christians believe this? even when i was a christian, i didn't believe all that. virgin mary? you gotta be kidding me. even as a catholic, that didn't make any sense. this creed strains credulity to the utmost, and i suspect you'll find lots of christians who don't accept it literally.
1	Well are there 4 or are there none? What about the Archaeopteryx lineage, why do you keep avoiding the question by changing the subject? It's no wonder scientists get annoyed with creationists.	but there aren't any! All you can show me are 4 "links". Where are the other millions?

Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay.	First of all, we are supposed to be introducing ourselves, not starting up a topic. But let me kill two birds with one stone here.Hi everyone, I'm new here. And I love to debate. I got kicked out of one debate, because I won the debate on linguistics, and the girl got mad, because she lost, and banned me from the froum. Hopefully no one here is as immature as that. But anyway, thats my story, I'm glad to be here. And I'm ready to debate. And here is my first victim.I'm against gay marriages. Why?! Because in order to mantain a healthy environment for children.(which they always seem to want to adopt) there has to be a healthy relationship. Now a child grows up, and sees two men/women dating eachother. That can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay. It is not only harmful to the family environment, but also to society. And don't hand me that," My uncle is gay." Stuff. I had(he passed away) a gay uncle, have three gay cousins, and a gay aunt. Not my whole family is not gay, but it seems like I have quite a few in my family. Now I don't support what they do. Even though I love them because they are my family, I would not support them if they were to marry.

Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together.	My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations. No....this is worse. Because this particular U.S. Senator, an avowed conservative Christian, has actively worked to restrict the rights of others to marry, supposedly in the name of "protecting" or "defending" marriage, while at the same time undermining his own marriage. He makes a pretense, for political gain I suspect, of "defending marriage" by playing to people's anti-gay prejudices while himself undermining marriage in his real life. That's hypocrisy, and it's dishonesty.

That is not what I said.I would think a Bible website would be good for biblical information, but for archaeological information? not so much.If you want to provide archaeological evidence of the Exodus, why don't you seek out information from an archaeology sources? Please answer this.If I wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings, I wouldn't seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource, I would seek an archaeology expert. Doesn't that make sense?	Moose automatically assumes a Bible website is always dishonest. Shame on you for that bigotry.

0	in what passages does jesus refer to his junior partner? i'm not saying he did not, rather, i'm not recalling off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus.	that's a matter of interpretation, 'god's spirit moved over the water' is in the old testament. the holy spirit is referred to repeatedly by jesus in the gospels, and the working of the spirit is a central theme in acts and paul's letters.
1	that i later 'concede' in a pm? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession.... what do you think a 'logical premise' is? show me denying that i said a. i'll be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. of course there is an objective truth here, i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable....	making up your own logic sounds exactly like something you would do. or maybe you just needed to redesign logic to go along with the redesigned universe you came up with when you first arrived?
0	simone darling, please stop. your making yourself look foolish. your trying to compare uniformed soldiers in an organized military under civilian gov't control to terrorists. there is no comparison to be made here, even you should be able to see that. huh? the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia.	confederate soldiers considered the intrusion of union soldiers as violation of their homeland. the taliban considered the intrusion of u.s. military into saudi arabia and afghanistan as violation of their homeland. and, remember, george w. bush capitulated to the taliban on saudi arabia and removed the u.s. military stationed toute suite. the way he conducted himself, bush probably wanted to get totally out of afghanistan too.
0	how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!	i believe dametel is referring to leviticus 20:13 - 'if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.' dametel hasn't discovered yet that in the new testament it is god who exercises this type of punishment when he deems fit, instead of man.
1	i am impressed you are impressed by that backward-minded bigot who's main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said, 'fuck the fags'? come on dude.	yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. i am impressed.
0	yeah, that was all just exaggeration and absurdities from religionist to make the story more fantastic and supernatural. or else nobody will ever join them religion.	well.. there have been plenty of jesus' till this day. i just don't believe that a certain jesus came to this planet, born by a virgin, walked on water, died on a cross so people can enter heaven.

0	The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow.

1	Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?	Mayabe they were wise, but they didnt have all the knowledge on the topic of power or they would still be in controll today. (I think... But I didnt even graduate from highschool, so what do I know. EH?)
1	in that case its a single act of terroism so if you know all of this what's the name of his group? i wasn't on a high horse. also could you post the source saying he was part of some group and not just a loon.  jeez that sucks. *shrugs* well no different from black leaders who were targeted, slave owners/abolitionists who were targeted. this happens all the time. i'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. i love how its a conspiracy! *roll eyes* its terrorism not a conspiracy. unless you gonna tell me the governments in on it. xd	uh, yeah. he did, and we do know why he did it. you should read some articles before you participate further. don't you think this is a good example of the pot calling the kettle black? i imagine the fbi has it, since they've reported on it, according to the article that was linked. as well as these lunatic abortion opponents, reported to be still circulating the names of people they've 'targeted'.
1	What the heck did you have for breakfast today, huh? A bowl of nails and terpentine to wash it down? Talk about a foul mood. You've been to half a dozen threads just this morning launching personal attacks at everybody you come across, and most of them have something to do with 'I'm glad there aren't more people in the world like you,' or 'I hope you're the only ones the terrorists kill so we can get back to making this nation great,' blah blah blah. They invented things like Midol for moods like yours.Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them stupid, or misguided, or immoral, or dishonest, or any of the other snipes you've been firing off. Lol, and you're telling me to not throw any hissy fits.	So, in other words, yes, honor and keeping your word means nothing to you. you will break your word in an instant if you feel it serves your purpose or interests at the time. Thank god there are not more people like you in the world/.
0	What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. MayThere is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations. I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3 One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:	Many contemporary authors prominent in bioethical circles distinguish sharply between being a human being and being a human person. These authors claim that for an entity to be regarded as a person, it must have developed at least incipiently exercisable cognitive capacities or abilities..... (Another view} distinguishes between a living human body and a living human person.
0	For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad. If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together.	But, what if, everything in the universe was originally "placed" pretty much where we see it now?

0	now lets add one more wrench into the anti-gun works! when the american people read, 90% of weapons come from the u.s. they are led to think, bought in an american gun store.  something even sinjin apparently believes as well. however, doing some research, i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u.s. weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store. why? because they came from the u.s. government, dea and the cia. military grade weapons. now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u.s. weapons?    central america: the farc, the contras and the flow of weapons  america! get the picture now?	although it must be noted that some percentage of the weapons that were not traceable could well have come from north of the border as well. then there's the weapons we were not asked to trace. do we know where those came from? in truth, the actual percentage of weapons in the hands of gangs and cartels that originate in the u.s. will likely never be known. how many u.s. prosecutions will result from even the 17%?  will that be dealers or 'straw purchasers'?
1	You evidentally didn't grasp the apparently immense complexity and vagueness of my post.	Are you for or against a ban on smoking in public places?
0	i'm pretty sure you're joking... but still, if one has the power to acquire and manipulate knowledge sufficiently well, then one can learn to protect himself from bombs and such. my house was recently afflicted by ants. massive amounts of ants. yet their numbers did not amount to much after the strategic placement of a few of these.	it doesn't matter how powerful your computer-powered multiplier of power becomes. the first time he eats a pizza with something good on it, has a beer or a little bit of grab-ass with a woman not wearing a beekeeper suit, muslims will commit to blowing up and/or beheading him, and by sheer number alone, they will succeed.
1	so atop a mountain of ignorance is where we will find religious people? yeah, sounds about right to me.	<flush> 'for the scientist who has lived by faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. he has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.'
0	Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.	Heading further down that path...If the "right" belongs to the child, then the "right" obviously also DOES NOT belong to those opposed to gays.More specifically, the "right" to WAIVE potential parents as ineligible does not belong to those who are opposed to gays.The "right" would belong to the child to decide who HE/SHE wants, and it would be a bigger usurpment of this right of the child to DENY the child the option of gay parents than it is to present him with the option.
1	So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot.	Still dumb to compare the two. Both are no good. Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.

0	Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one.	if something happens to the people who are named on the website as a direct result of the website then i would say a great deal of justice is due and the burden of guilt is on the one who runs the website. maybe i should give a list of all the homosexuals in my community to a group of drunk rednecks... this is as bad as the registered sex offender list.
0	the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.	no. it would show that the government actually opposed the hostage takers.  over the last generation or so, the dutch became quite good at rescuing hostages from the hijacked trains that became an annual event; the russians lost a number of hostages in a theater a few years ago when the gas they used proved a bit strong; and the filipinos became notorious for losing all hostages. but in every case where hostages were lost, the government was criticized for lack of competence rather than complicity. in iran, the mullahs were tacitly complicit in the crime. surrender to terrorism, such as you propose, does not work in the real world - it only encourages the terrorists.
0	If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is "true"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator. References:* The Creationist Basis for Modern Science.* The Lie: Evolution ~ Ken Ham.* Evolution: Fact or Fiction? ~ John Blanchard.	Keep in mind two important points:1. Reason does not imply truth, it's a method of seperating truth from what is false, and you can quite easily (and do every day), reason something to a false conclusion. 2. You can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason.
0	if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep.	your link to not go to a definition of marriage. ot goes to a link for the word: marauder-marauder - one who, while employed in the army as a soldier, commits a larceny or robbery in the neighborhood of the camp, or while wandering away from the army. so really what was your point cause you haven't made one!!!!
1	Ha. Those must be the same folks who believe in the missing link like you do.	I am surprised (well not really) that you don't see the simularity.And, we must not forget the Elvis believers too

1	would you like some cheese with that whine? emoticonxrolleyes btw this only shows over 60+ years of liberal government incompetence.	i think that it demonstrates that the liberal biased media got it dead wrong. no residents blame the mayor and governor, not bush. as for the adulation, it's tough to bite the hand that's building you a new house using federal bucks. emoticonxcensored  the fact is that no was given considerably more money than any other state for army coe projects and la chose to spend it on various pet projects instead of fixing the levee. the last woman interviewed by dean renyolds had it right. they were given federal money to fix the problem and they didn't.  sour grapes make for a poor wine. they make a better whine. emoticonxrolleyes
1	Umm, don't know about you but I also eject waste through my penis - just don't do it when having sex, just not polite (unless they ask, now there's another fetish I don't get). Isn't it odd if the anus was not designed for a penis its still pleasurable?	The anus is used to eject waste, accept this too. In fact it is dangerous to shove things up there, such as a penis, especially when the body is trying to send waste out; this courses all manner of problems associated with digestion.
0	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.	In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'? The way I read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something. What was truncated?
0	But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.	We are talking about constitutional rights. In that case, even if you want to put religion into the mix. You really can't.
0	The guy can have an opinion but the ultimate choice is up to the woman who can listen to what the guy says or not, it's up to her. I believe that is what sinjin was saying.	That is not necessarily true. I have known girls who have gotten pregnant and wanted an abortion but the fathers of the babies told them they didn't want them to have an abortion so the didn't and now the baby is healthy.
1	not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage. 'ex-gays' are supposedly straight, right? so they are already protected under existing legislation. if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans, and then insisted they should be known as 'ex-democrats', would we need another legal status for them? no.	i don't keep track of who is who, but whoever is pushing for hate crime laws that establish gays as a protected group with special legal rights. on the other hand there are some groups pushing only for equal rights, e.g. in marriage and in the abolition of discriminatory laws. utterly irrelevant. i have no interest in groups 'classifiying equal rights as special rights', i'm talking about some demanding special rights, others equal. again, utterly pointless. i believe in equal rights for all people. not one set of rights for whites, one for blacks, one for women, one for men, one for gays, one for straights. that apparently means i hate gays. take a look at this garbage: http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/cou...e-homosexuals/
0	Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word "proof" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story.	It's really not that complicated, after all you did admit that you don't know. So I should not accept what you say without some degree of doubt. In which case I would ask for proof since my experience has shown you to be inconsistent in your responses
1	That explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? ROTFLMAO	Nice work; I think that the reason those kids who own guns are more likely to get into trouble is a result of a specific political outlook that they are raised under which has an ifluence on their thinking.

1	Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march.	it is hard to believe that it won't draw attention away from everyone else. but everyone will get it and it will draw attention away from the families that are there supporting their kids...and the fact still remains that your goal is to influence (or show) the administration when it should be to give your child a good time.  when your purpose is to draw attention it is hard to imagine that it wouldn't take it away from the main purpose. think of it this way...you have 1 camera at the event...you hear about this 't-shirt' thing and all of a sudden the camera is not focusing on the kid tripping over himself to roll the egg but to gay parents wearing these t-shirts and them talking about how they are great parents. my question is...if you are such great parents why aren't you with your kid instead of talking to the tv camera about your personal message? i don't buy it anymore than if someone got a big group together and had t-shirts that said 'i chose life for my child!'.
0	Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.	It is a direct accusation by the CURATOR OF BIRDS for the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION against all the proponents of the dino bird story.
1	Are you blind? I was refering to Nancy Pelosi's "'fair' speech" policies, not free speech. Fair speech is an attempt to limit free speech.	Crock! Tripe! Poppycock! Utter nonsense!It sounds like a bunch of bozos still haven't figured out what free speech is all about.
0	race is the elephant in the room of american politics. segregation is not official, but who can deny that de facto segregation does not exist in the usa? blacks stick to blacks and whites to whites. do you see any blacks in the tea party meetings? how many blacks voted for jon mccain in the last presidential elections?	again you're missing the historical context just as timothy mcveigh did. locke was an english philosopher who died in 1704 so he wasn't involved in writing the constitution. did you know that jefferson was an advocate of racial segregation? 'nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them.' -thomas jefferson so if jefferson could be wrong about that then he could be wrong about this too. furthermore, as i already pointed out, other founding fathers opposed him on the matter.
0	Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of "creation science" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion.	If there are many people reading this that already believe in evolution, or for that matter, believe in biblical creationism, then it is important to keep in mind that the people appealing to science have biases at work, regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves.
1	Hey, it's the same god, just older. The birth of his son mellowed him out, you know,.. made him think about the future more, and have to worry about responsibility and all that stuff.	So, you're saying the god of the old testament and the god of the new testament are different gods? What happened to the old one? Why isn't this mentioned in the bible? Why does it keep referring back to the OT without mentioning that the god that is around today is a different one?
0	Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of "creation science" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science.	Wow a statement that is both honest and correct from a creationist! Will wonders never cease!
1	I am not making a mockery of the second ammendment (and so what if I am. Isn't free speech on the first ammendment?). I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this. If I was mocking anything it was that you were dodging the question because you want to say no limits although in face of something so obvious you are embarrassed at such a statement.	You are making a mockery of the 2nd Amendment. You know the answer.
1	Fundies don't say do as I say, not as I do. We say do as God says, not as I do. There's a huge difference.	Fundies talking about double standard is a real laugh and a half!!!! These are the ones who preach "do as I say, not as I do." Now there's a double standard.
1	In the future, please try to spare me the theatrical flair.   ....	Uh, I think to any thinking person it should be clear that the 95% number is my opinion, not a stiatistic I pulled out of a report somewhere. I am not sure how one would even calculate such a thing, unless you had ever private who enlisted in the military run by the local wally world and fill out an application.

1	The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust.	You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.
1	as i said, for clarification, and no other reason. it's all drivel to me anyway, so i didn't see the problem in adding evolution onto theory. show where it said that if you would, and clarify your question. if you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life. i'm surprised you couldn't deduce that by just reading what it said. why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article? can't you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it?	the question is why did you change the sentence? as has been said, the thermonuclear reaction taking place in the core of the sun is not mentioned in the theory of evolution. so, you managed to make the first sentence of your 'proof' complete and utter rubbish. not a good start then. some other questions i would like answered about your 'proof' would be: why is it assumed that the nuclear reaction taking place in the sun's core would be perfectly linear? from above, if the sun's life is around 10 billion years, why would 4.6 billion years be its half-life? do you know what a half-life is with regards to nuclear reactions? that's just the first paragraph. if you can answer them satisfactorily then i might get onto the rest of your 'proof'. smiley
0	Really? Let me see. Two creation myths and a global flood myth where 5 million "kinds" of animal were crammed into a big box that magically floats for a year - yeah, that's secular history.	Mythology doen't include historcally correct and factual prophecy. The claims made in the Bible can all be see in secular history.
0	I do appreciate your point while I disagree on principle. I guess it boils down to the fact that even if I believed in a God I couldn't accept that He would command us to suppress our true innate nature. Why would He makes us that way and then expect such a thing? Christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what God commands. To suppress a good many natural inclinations. To accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished, our nature brought to heel.	No, of course sexuality isn't strictly about behavior. The point is that religious belief about behavior is about behavior. Of course I agree with you about sexuality, but that is a different issue. The point is that it is not innateness that is opposed by religion. It is a behavioral issue. Saying something someone DOES is immoral is not the same as saying THEY are immoral.
0	originally posted by easyrider  would they have died for a lie, if christ were not resurrected? not likely. like i said, i doubt that very much.	sure they would. their belief does not confirm or deny the validity of the resurrection. it shows traditionally the died for him, but there is only hearsay evidence that was the case.  if belief is all that is necessary i have a friend who needs some help getting some money out of nigeria. interested in making some quick tax free money?
0	No I shouldn't be fighting against abiogenesis, I'm for unrestricted freedom to explore it all!	hmm, interesting philosophy. This debate is on whether ID SHOULD be in the science curriculum as a valid alternative to evolution. You're justification is that science already has theories that are unproven, so ID should be taught too? Besides the fact that this isn't true, shouldn't you be fighting against abiogenesis instead of for it and ID?
0	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i think that it can because money has fixed all of my problems.  come on! give me an answer to what can't money fix? leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. i would feel however i was feeling before i died. in the debates hypothetical i wouldn't even know that i was going to die. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that? wow! there are many things? to back up your assertion, list 5 of these things for me.	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i care because im tired of people dying for no good reason. leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. that the people who are getting this money is selfish that they care about wealth than lives. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that?
0	and the other two...? 'political disorder and confusion' is not the same as personal 'disorder and confusion'.	as has been pointed out to you now more than once, the most that can be ascertained from the evidence is that it was possibly done in some places--perhaps in remote areas or areas that were not entirely in lockstep with rome (or constantinople early on). there is much more evidence that the rcc has been consistent in it's belief that gay relationships are not a holy matrimony. (see http://4forums.com/political/showpos...2&postcount=84)
1	WOW are we seeing the softer, gentiler Jyoshu?   Your snoopy avatar must be afecting you :) :p	I don't think I've ever heard of a church that reinstated a minister after he admitted he was gay. Even upon a 'repentance'. Have you? A lot of Christians view homosexuality as a lot worse and darker sin than the Bible makes it out to be--they take that and it colors their view of a gay person as a person, which is taking it too far. Gay people are right when they say that things like divorce are a lot more prevalent of a problem; I think churches need to cool it some on the homosexuality thing and simply work on showing the love of Christ.
0	I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.	I don't think pro-choicers in general care whether or not abortion is truly rare. If they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare, and not just legal.
0	What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.	#3 - Can anyone explain to me why no other apes, monkeys or chimps have evolved into a higher species?

0	one idea per episode? there were always at least 4; one for each main character. and they always linked together perfectly. with the exception of a few episodes at the beginning and the last one, seinfeld was always gold.  the simpsons, on the other hand, has sucked for the last few years when they turned to the 'pick a celebrity guestspot' system.	the show 'seinfeld' was absolutely hilarious. his stand up comedy is also great.
0	you're assuming a need to reduce it because government, or a special interest, requests it. if enough people want it reduced, their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it. deemed by whom? the government, or a special interest? who cares about the species? the majority of individuals, or the government, or a special interest? if the majority doesn't consider them problems, then no solutions are necessary.	ok, no one said that i would look to a large govt for anything.  if individuals are better suited to solve environmental problems, i'd love to hear some of these solutions. this is why i started this thread, because the info out there is far from satisfactory. can you please explain how private individuals would, say, reduce co2 emissions from automobiles? or, maybe, protect an area that has been deemed a toxic waste dump from leaking toxins into the soil? or protect a certain species of bird or marsupial (some forest-dwelling creature) from having his habitat destroyed by logging, endangering the survival of the species? can you offer any libertarian solutions to the other problems i cited above?
1	Leave it to a leftist to cite a leftist forum for evidence that a leftist agenda is supported by dedicated leftists. Go figure, huh? This post just proves that attempting to reason with such an irrational thinker is truly a waste of time and effort.	You need to visit some other websites; i.e. get yourself out and around in the real internet world some more.Shake the cobwebs off your bold.There are, for example, presently thousands of posts at the New York Times, in only the last day or two, from single payer and public option supporters.Go scream your bold there Big Shot. You and your other handles that comprise this entire forum of one man who probably also needs to see a doctor for a strong psychiatric prescription.
0	Clinton gave access to b/c which is known to prevent pregnancies. Bush has reduced access to b/c (including e/c). A primary reason for aborting is money - Americans have been less well off under Bush.	Of course, we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time.
0	Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.	that is nothing but conjecture. Are you telling me that arctic foxes at some point in history did not have this ability?

0	And for the record, i think anyone that tries to take away a women's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life, or has any concious about the woman at stake here. You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. I am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do.	That's your problem. Any other subjects on which you are delusional?probably....I think anyone who kills an unborn child with a knife to the head is a murderer. Does that make me delsional?
0	HA wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints, muscels, heart, and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb? Obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet. Some of which can be detrimental.I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out.And im not really sure what a "pregnancy" is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant, i think of 2 people, not just 1.Also, the baby has its own blood, its own immune system, and contains its own calories once consumed. theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion. Just like you need food everyday.	That's really simplified. It's not like a woman's body is a suitcase and the fetus is biologically self-reliant. It lives off her life processes - her blood, her immune system, her calories - it puts stress on her joints, muscles, heart, and bladder. Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental. No a baby isn't the woman's body - but a pregnancy IS.

1	Don't forget cheaper to feed, take orders better, and are harder to hit.	First off, just because some Iraq's are crazy and use their children as weapons, does not mean all Iraqi's are such. Second, I think people use the younger people for wars for a couple of reasons. One reason is they are easier to convince to do something like go to war than a guy that is 40 or older. Every country uses their young people for war. They are also more physically fit. .
0	Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it.	Did you expect a creationist to understand the definition of Honesty? He's a creationist for crying out loud.Their manta is "to lie, steal, cheat, and defraud anyone" to get their message across.
0	Brinks plays on people's fears to sell security systems that don't even work. Insurance companies play on people's fears to sell their policies.	"(17.) The glorification of firearms in movies and video games is wrong and promotes irresponsible gun usage, but the gun industry's advertising propaganda, which exploits people's fear of criminals to sell guns, is perfectly responsible.
0	He was barred for presenting hard evidence against the Big Bang. Observable evidence. He was the head astronomer at Mt Carmel not just another astronomer. He was our best one.Being barred from the telescopes he was in charge of , being fired , and having to move to Germany is not what you consider suppression? I am not willing to discuss this with you anymore if you refuse to do it honestly. You can say anything.	Halton Arp is far from suppressed.Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.
0	well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?	nfa, not nra - but your point remains... 'to his credit/discredit' is largely irrelevant to my point, however - i wasn't attempting to insult his personality. however, the fact that he represents the nfa strongly implies that he has a pro-gun bias; something which should definitely be considered when reading an opinion piece, which the op is an example of. when someone says 'there is no convincing evidence for x', you have to look at what biases they may have about x which might cause them to set their requirements for 'convincing' to be higher - or lower! - than a less biased author would.
1	And you know what I think? I think that everyone who doesn't have sex 24 hours a day 7 days a week is denying human beings life every second. I'm sure some of those sperm would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you don't think they should live [/sarcasm]. Why don't you think this? Why embryos? Embryos are the one thing that have great potential to cause harm in a woman, and you just so happen to choose them as human beings. Very suspicious...	abortion is all fine and dandy to you until it comes down to your own life.... obviously because you reacted in such a way...The point being... "mental eistence" is relative if we take your view.So what youre saying is an embryo that has survived an abortion because they couldnt kill it all the way still has no mental existance?? i would say that those people are glad to be alive and im sure some of those aborted babies would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you dont think they should live..

Oh wait, that's impossible. Nevermind.
0	Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing.	It's technically not killing. Killing means making it dead. For the most animals, the indicator for life is brain activity (Note: brain activity is one of the requirements of life, but it's not THE definition). When the sperm meets the egg, there is no brain activity. In fact there maybe no brain activity until the end of the first trimester.
1	woohoohoo, diogenes, talk about twisting my statements, wow! wow! i am just plain flabbergasted!	agreed. it seems to me, in light of the number of recent child rape/murder cases committed by recidivists, that simone has it backwards and those folks who have no faith in our justice system would rather see ten innocents die rather than punish one guilty person.

0	ya know what? this has inspired me to make a thread, hold on a sec.	i don't think personal attacks are the route to take, but i may be too nice :p i would emphasize that while the fetus does have importance as a potential member of our society, when the woman becomes pregnant we have to deal with what it is. with no consciousness it is not a moral entity that we have obligation to it, or at least our obligation cannot be as great as we owe the woman as an autonomous individual.
0	Even if it was murder, do you really expect me to side with the party that broke into Martin's house and robbed him?	Tony Martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away. That's not self-defence, that's cold blooded murder.

1	back to the blame us first, are we? stick to terrorist-supporting iran today. and even if we did, two wrongs still don't make a right.	do you have any idea what kind of **** the us backed in the 50s to 80s? oh wait, you have no understanding of history in any way shape or form.  look up us involvement in the begium congo. the us help support a regime that butchered men, women and children because they wouldn't work essentially as slaves.  during that time period, the us was one of the major backs of terrorism. our hands are no cleaner then their's are.
1	and jyoshu is in full cheer-leader mode... what the heck did i supposedly back-peddle on? please. be explicit. no wait. you're not going to answer that, are you... roflmao! symbiote runs around proclaiming all sorts of things (falsely) as my supposed hypothesis, and you pretend that me refusing to take up her strawman approach is somehow 'back-peddling'? more like the blind leading the blind, walking in circles and thinking they are travelling quickly! as for proof, do you understand what 'hypothesis' means in the first place? look it up.	wow. symbiote has your number on this one. you're in full-out back-pedal mode here, huh? again, give some proof of causality about that claim, and then we'll talk. not whatever you're shifting to as your 'hypothesis' to avoid having to back up the claim you made in your first post.

1	wow, i am surprised you didn't say 'kill the retards.'	capital punishment is hypocritical no matter what the state of the accused is determined.
1	irrelevant. what about the common people that weren't blessed with god's son? revenge: definition, synonyms from answers.com tr.v., -venged, -venging, -venges. 1. to inflict punishment in return for (injury or insult). 2. to seek or take vengeance for (oneself or another person); avenge. n. 1. the act of taking vengeance for injuries or wrongs; retaliation. 2. something done in vengeance; a retaliatory measure. 3. a desire for revenge; spite or vindictiveness. 4. an opportunity to retaliate, as by a return sports match after a defeat. tell me, simone, how exactly does using force to defend oneself qualify as revenge? revenge is tracking down the person that wronged you and cutting their throat when they're at their most vulnerable. revenge isn't killing your attacker because you're in fear of your own life.	what about your son, as mary did? taking revenge on the wicked is god's perogative.
0	ummm... the death penalty has always been around. i never claimed that death was the penalty for every crime, nor that it was the most common punishment. try to catch up	That is not exactly true. There is written law going 2500+ years back and death penalty was not the most common punishment used. It was used only for specific crimes, while the most common practice was eye for an eye doctrine. At least until the time of the Roman Empire and their law.Lol, read your Bible more carefully next time. I don't know it in detail but well enough that I know your words are full of BS.
1	Yes I apologize for your ignorance and your inability to 'get it'....	Thank you for your apology. There you were implying I had no right to talk about America, I'm glad you've 're-invited' me into this debate.
1	Is there some kind of prize for most consecutive straw-man arguments. I ask this because you seem to be going for a record. No where have I claimed that I would fix your problems, many though there are.	Thank goodness we have you to fix our "problems" for us. Maybe we should write a catechism and burn people who disagree with us. Then will we qualify as a religion worthy of your oh-so-valuable esteem?
1	i so love it when you have to work so hard to avoid any points i made. i take it as assent to my original post.	so you don't consider a woman's right to vote a civil right??? interesting. emoticonxwow  the civil rights act of 1964 and the amendments were the most relevant and influential elements in civil rights--it seems the trend these days in your movement is to not use acts and amendments but instead to use the courts as a means to an end to avoid using an act or amendment. probably because you know you have a snowball's chance in hell of getting one.
0	True. Gallup couches the questions in a way that favors spiritualism. That is his preference and I think that his polls are slanted that way. I don't think I have ever seen a poll that actually asked the question directly and "no religion" doesn't really ask it. The numbers are just guesses. I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low.	The trouble with those poles is that peopel who 'have no religion' can be theists, and there are atheists that assocatite themselves to religions for social reasons.
1	You don't want anyone saying gay people are whacked, but you will make it your business to insult someones religion?! You are a hypocrite!! You say,"Don't judge gays!" But you are judging people by their religon?! I thought you were more mature then that. Hey you live ad learn.emoticonXRolleyes	I saw the same thing amongst the Jehovah's Witnesses. They even encouraged it. Get, married - get a job. They also strongly discourage post-secondary education. Its like they knew that once these kids hit college they would a) get too horny, b) find reasons to question their faith. But then the Witnesses are absolutely whacked. So are the Mormons.
0	darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class.	i have seen these debates and granted mine are not the best debates and may just be plain and simple retarded but my answers match the question. at least i think they do. but all you have to do is skip right over them.
0	Says who? People have the right to say anything they want to. There is NO right to not be judged by someone. It doesn't matter if something someone else does affects you and me or not. People can think whatever they want about other people. People can also SAY what they want. As far as a personal philosophy of behavior, I agree with you--what you're saying is a good rule to live by. But I can't agree people have no right to condemn or judge others.	I don't have to support the behavior associated with some innate propensities but I have no right to condemn or judge someone for not being able to overcome them. In fact I have no right to suggest they even try if it doesn't impact me directly and negatively. What gay people do or don't do defines my life zip, zilch, nada.
0	1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. i haven't watched tv in quite a few years, and when i did i didn't watch c span.  where are the facts that the court has cited? 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself. wouldn't i have to be in denial in the first place though?	1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself.
0	Oh it's no mistake Montalban. I, unlike you, am quite clear in my arguments, and have a direction and a goal. We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you "allow" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it!	That is one definition of creation. There are many. You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about, and argue against that.If you want a (non-exhaustive list) seehttp://www.crystalinks.com/creation.htmlYou have simply picked one model, treated it as the only one, and constructed a (thus false) argument against it.
1	You know I actually considered that. Too much work, though. I have added to my list of things to do when I retire. That is, of course, assuming that we turned things around by then. If not, I will likely be too busy "holding the fort" against the hordes of starving yuppies.	Looks to me like its time to set things straight by writing your own book and name it " The Kansas Conspiracy Farce" by Daewoo :)
1	I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?	It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
1	Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be. These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone.	Tell me about it. They had Kerry winning FL by 2 or 3%, they had Kerry winning PA by double digits, and they had it close in VA and SC.  Needless to say, Bush won FL by 7% (9% different than the exit polls), Kerry won PA by 2% (at least 8% different than the exit polls), and Bush won VA and SC by 10% and 17% respectively. I was reading a good article by Dick Morris about the apparent bias in the exit polls. He actually called Kerry to win it easy after looking at the exit polls. Turns out, they were terrible. He said that exit polls are nearly always right or very, very close. There is no possible way they could "accidentally" be so off the end result.
0	And are people in DC legally allowed to carry their guns with them in a concealed manner, having them readily available like the rest of us do in the country?Absolutely not. According to DC your rights don't extend past your home, and it barely even exists inside your home.	Pure ignorance here,everybody take note.In Heller v. DC, in 2008, the SCOTUS reinterpreted the 2nd amendment and invalidated DC gun laws. The Indiana Law Blog: Courts - New DC gun laws tested under Heller standard [Updated again]So gun nuts got their way in DC and now look what happens...
0	That just sounds alarmist to me. Do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights? It is just not going to happen.	Maybe, but he's no centrist and with the way the congress looks he will most likely put very anti-gun judges in the Supreme court, which means the 2nd Amendment would be pretty much dead. Don't believe me? Look at California. Stupidest laws we have and they do not even work! Criminals still steal and buy illegal weaponry. The judges here are so far left, they themselves admit it! (Look up judge Reinhardt.) I'm not saying being a lefty is bad, it's just that it seems some would throw away a right just to "feel" safe. That's the worse thing YOU can do.

1	Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime?

1	as to the first part, i answered you above. regarding the second part; what in the world are you talking about? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs? and boys born of virgin mothers? can you post any evidence of these cases? beside jesus of course, because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit.	which is exactly why i asked  why are these opinions shallow and vaccuous? and just to push your opinion a little further, if the soul enters the new being at fertilization, then does this mean that those girls (though very rare) who are born just from an unfertilized egg have no souls. is a special case made for these human beings? one might ask the same question of the even more rare boy born of a virgin mother. i'm not saying that you are wrong. i was just wondering if your theory extends this far. smiley
0	Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing.       Why didn't YOU cite them?	Obviously, you can't please everyone!! That is just a story of one person. Why didn't you cite the statements of millions of Iraqis who praise our help in removing their totalitarian leader?

0	But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption.	Believers; even if people who don't believe in creation and say that we can't prove it, so what!!! We believe and have our faith!! Thats what matters!!And for people that don't believe, think about this. If the "big bang" created matter than were did the stuff needed to make the "big bang" come from?
0	There is never a question of "killing people" in such circumstances, it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die, i.e. where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery.	Often, this debate becomes dotted with examples of things like human vegetables who might come out of their coma as potential people who aren't really people, or a person who was knocked out in a brawl as a potential person who is not (on some level) currently a person, and many other examples. We often believe it is immoral to kill people in these conditions, so the potentiality argument says that a fetus is just as sacred and requires our protection.
0	jito, i forgot to thank you for agreeing with me on eugenics. what is that?...the second or third time we have ever agreed? well, you have only 8,966 more things to agree on with me to show you have converted to proper thinking! emoticonxangel  consent is relevant when it is relevant. do you deny that women engaging in sexual intercourse (outside of rape or some other type of coercion) give consent to engage in an act that may result in pregnancy? i never said that sex was only for procreation and i don't believe it is. i do believe, however, that the procreative potential of sex must be respected. i do believe that when a being comes about as the result of a sexual act then that being should be respected.	this argument is not believable from you max. your stance does not change for rape, therefore 'consent' is irrelevant to you. and of course here you go wanting to meddle in the lives of others by telling all of us we only get to engage in sex for procreation. how pervy...
0	Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.	then your argument too is flawed by the same principals of debate.
0	no, i completely agree. it's frustrating from a woman's point of view also. does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere, it's solely the woman's responsibility to take care of the child? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting.	absolutely. even worse are the rights of unmarried fathers, who seem to have no rights whatsoever just because they never married the mother of the child. i completely believe that fathers can be just as good parents as mothers, even better in some cases.  but everything is mother centred when it comes to parenting, for example, why are baby changing areas always within the womens toilets? what are men supposed to do if they take out their baby themselves? off topic i know but it's infuriating!
0	do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them? also you failed to address my point. is self-defense not a legitimate use for guns?	'most of the time' is not good enough. killing animals is murdering members of other species and those same guns can be used and are used for killing humans. the same applies to guns used for target shooting. you can take them home, have them stolen and then used to commit a crime; or your son can take them to school and shoot a few dozens kids. well, i am not saying a school massacre has ever taken place in the usa or canada; don't get me wrong oswald only used his gun for hunting, didn't he?
1	the nice part. i'm surprised that you've even read the bible. presumably you're commenting on 1 thessalonians 5:2, wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that.	halifax, what part of philly is that? :)  i am ready for judgment day..........as you know the bible says that death comes like a thief in the night.......well maybe your bible does not say that...sorry........
1	So if you were attacked by a 250 pound man who is an 8th Degree Blackbelt, you'd prefer a fair fight?	Also, a person has a change to run from those other things, admiittedly, a tossed rock can do damage, and if your opponent is especially hefty, a frying pan might fly a goodly distance, but it's the pure cowardly aspect of whipping out a gun that angers me, having a considerable advantage at a considerable distance.

1	You can take a horse to water. I provided evidence to support my assertion. You provided ............ "Oh no it isn't!"	Patellar? That's the front of the knee, what's that got to do with this argument.I've read the link, and just because it came out of Harvard doesn't mean that it's official or that it's of any measure of validity. It looks fancy but that doesn't mean it's truthful. So maybe you'd like to try again; with something not so biased next time.
1	But religion is not a topic for science classes. Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative.	The problem is that you have wack jobs and zealots on both sides of the issue. On the one hand, you have the YEC/creationist crowd. Some fo them go off the deep end when you suggest anything but a literal interpetationof Genisis. On the other side, you have the evolutionaist crowd, who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue.
1	you don't know? oh yeah... you're supposedly married to that teenager, prodigee.	who is dana and what does he have to do with whether these two countries are alike?
0	Well firstly we do not know that "volition" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.	My second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems, because a computer cannot model volition, the defining characteristic of life.
1	Therefore you accept that the Republican party almost as a whole is "grade A USDA approved Liberalism." About time you did.	First off, That's grade A USDA approved Liberalism in a nutshell.

1	Hang in here everyone, Bassman's been reading "_____"'s posts over and over and they've got him talking about the "American Holocaust"! emoticonXBanghead   Until you have been in my exact situation, I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand. I really don't give a emoticonXCensored if you think it is selfish or not - it is not for you to judge.	This is why I do not advocate the American Holocaust that has destroyed nearly fifty million unborn children on the altar of "choice"! Shadow's reasoning that "I'll have a baby when I'm ready" smacks of pure, unadulterated selfishness. I do not give a tinker's damn about the reason nor circumstances. When that child is conceived, all bets are off and the focus must be on that child!!!
0	The same could be said of Clinton.Tell me. How do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations?If a person like Sanford isn't exposed to his own medicine, how will he (or others) not recognize how it tastes?Furthermore, I find your perspective a little baffling.What he said "many years ago"? Is that something he should be embarrassed of, because he was wrong?Or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught?Cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard. It's a good standard.We have too many politicians who look out for their own interests, and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously.	es' past (from many years ago in fact) in their faces when they mess up.
1	i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.	so what is it you are looking for?  sympathy? yes, i'm sorry you had to go through that. i wouldn't wish that on anyone. it sounds like you definitely had a difficult time and i can understand why you may have hesitated in a decision to let him live.  are you looking for mothers always having access to medical care which you almost did not have? i agree, they all should. though i don't think you would have been turned away at most any hospital--it probably happens on rare occassion. but i agree, women should have whatever medical care they need. if you are looking for me to say that 'abortion is ok in some circumstances', i can't do that unequivocally. if the life of the mother is in definite danger, then yes.
1	We all agree that abortion is "killing". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open "mind". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead.	It doen't matter what trimester it is in. The shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life. By arguing if the baby is considered living, is just people's way of trying to justify what they already know is wrong, hoping that the excuse of "if the baby isn't conscious of it, then it isn't that wrong." It doesn't matter if the baby knows it or not. Even if it was conscious of it, it won't care in a second. The moral dilemma comes in that, you had the intent of killing and that is what makes abortion in any stage morally wrong!!!!The better question is, Should the government take action? because this is a wierd situation where the life is still 100% dependent of the mom and therefore a part of her body. The argument of a soul is negligable because there is no proof of the exsistence to of souls.I have no answer for you, just a plea to please keep an open mind and have compassion for both sides of the argument. It is the only way we can create progress and not hate.
0	First of all, when gun owners say ban guns, it means, if you want to ban ANY Gun, you are a gun banner! You guys want to muck up the argument with we don't want to ban all guns, just some guns! However, that statement is just for now! If you get the ban more will be following!   Nelson T. 'Pete' Shields -- Founder of Handgun Control, Inc.	I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources
1	You know you have outwitted a conservative thinker when they completely dodge the argument you have made.	Your reasoning is not only infantile, it's completely sadistic. But if you can't even see that then there is no reason to even attempt to discuss it with you. So, see ya... emoticonXBye
0	I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting.	BTW - I don't think hell is a place, either. For the lack of a better word, I believe it is a direction that eventually leads to spiritual death.
1	this particular one, formulated the way it is, might well fail. that's why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is.  where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from 'controversial' issues? ooooo... that's a persuasive legal argument. i'm impressed (not). gay people have been 'earning it' for over 100 years. in the short-term, we may suffer setbacks, in the long-term, there's no stopping us. another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue. no matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, republican-appointed judges. of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom.	if the lawsuit makes it to the scotus, it will go down in flames. chances are that they wouldn't even hear it, though. it's may be deemed too controversial for them to take at this time. either way, doma will be upheld.  if you want the law changed, you're going to have to earn it. the backdoor via a liberal judge won't cut it this time. the only way is the front door.
1	and you shouldn't forget the thousands of gays incinerated at this death camp!!!	you mean like sodom and gomorrah?

1	you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions. woopdee fucking doo. but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. well done darling. but being an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of years with not the rest of their lives. now let's get back to the facts - where in an arranged marriage does it say the 2 people getting arranged don't have a choice?	... no, but all arranged marriages are, tada! arranged ._. why is this thinking thing so hard for you? if there happens to be an arranged marriage where everyone lives happily ever after, awsome! but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. you just have a knee-jerk reaction to defend anything of your culture past or present. you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions.
0	Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.	You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence, I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods.'
0	How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child. And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law. So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that, there is no question.	Indeed. Many people don't realize that the commandment is not "thou shalt not kill," but "thou shalt not murder." The important question then becomes, when is killing murder?I have no doubt that God cares for the lives of fetuses. But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women.The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it's often taken to establish that abortion is murder, and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly. But the passage isn't talking about abortion at all. Which just leaves us with the question of when it is or isn't acceptable to take a life, and the passage doesn't provide guidance to that general question, either.
0	oh yes this is all over the news in ireland. irish farmers are having a canary that its the end of ireland's sugar industry. and cereal too because of crop rotation. nobody seems to have even thought of the question as to why exactly the eu should pay for an unsustainable industry as oppossed to farmers moving into something profitable. edit: oh and its tied into something about sugar being one of irelands few natural resources. emoticonxbanghead	nice! hopefully we can get out of this pointless business of propping up our inefficient and pointless agricultural sector before this century is over.
1	is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james.	want the list of military actions he engaged in as president?

0	wow that's an excellent bit of knowledge. i didn't know that about the ps updates, i only had 1 and 2 and i felt like the hassle of continually buying a new one was not worth the free internet. also, as for the red ring of death on xbox, i guess i wasn't an extreme enough gamer to let mine over heat.	i prefer the playstation because you get to have free to play online and you don't have to pay online.  you have some major titles that xbox doesn't have like infamous, ratchet and clank series, uncharted, god of war, the last of us, sly 1,2,3,and 4, jack and daxter collection, killzone, heavy rain, resistance, and others that i can't name off the top of my head.  playstation does make updates on things the reason they came out with the slim ps3 was to prevent the yellow light of death to other users who had that problem because their ps3 overheated.  xbox had the same problem as well but they had the red ring of death and they changed the color of their xbox to the black and they have slim as well.
0	Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups.	The KKK use of firearms isn't a legal and lawful use, as dictated in the Heller ruling.Next argument please!
0	And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.	I don't think the point was to come up with an exact number of gun laws. The point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro-gun side is very doubtful. But the total number of gun laws may not tell us a whole lot. 100 cities could pass laws to require waiting periods. That would count as 100 gun laws. Or the Federal Government could pass one law to require a waiting period throughout the nation. It would count as one law but would have more of an effect than 100 separate city laws.
0	They have. Prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction, almost 360 degrees around. Predator animals have their both eyes facing forward.	I think his point is paulie, that if evolution is actually as evo defines it, as changes made by way of random mutations, then why doesn't life reflect those random mutations? For example, why haven't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them?Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change, yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects, most every creature in creation has 2 eyes, 1 mouth, 2 ears, (if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator.)It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies. But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young. So why haven't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads?
0	Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example.	Genisis includes many events and personel that have been proven to take place and lived. Why would a book be right about the lives and events recorded in it and wrong about origin.
0	We are on due process now? How can you evolve how you deal with due process? Due process simply means that processes which are required by law. The court evolved this into substantive due process which is changing the meaning of the constitution. Do you deny substantive due process?	Look, what I said was that the courts have evolved how they deal with due process. They haven't evolved the meaning of the Constitution. It means the same as it always did. It's just that in the 21st century, however much it annoys you, we regard gay people as equal human beings. That is what has evolved, no matter how much you resent it.
0	That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed.	However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.
0	I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.	Why should they kill a human being in the womb, whether this human being is Arab or not? Aren't the Arab and non-Arab created by God? Why all this discrimination among the creation of God?eanassir

1	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.	So, you don't judge! Then it's okay to lump all Christians together!Evidently, that makes it all better!So much for being a free-thinker.But then again, you never addressed the issue I asked you about slavery.You claimed to be moral, based on democratic ideals of moarlity... but democracy would have very likely continued slavery in the USA!It was Christians who aimed higher. I'm sorry if you want to talk past that, and say I disgust you.
1	So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage.	They should be discredited, and their hypocrisy should be exposed. Here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry, supposedly in "defense" of "traditional marriage," when some of them are out sneaking around, cheating on their wives, and lying about it when confronted. The only reason this guy admitted the truth is because evidence surfaced about his visits to prostitutes. Meanwhile, has has tried to advance his political career at the expense of gay people. Some defender of marriage! This is a classic example of someone needing to get the log out of his own eye.
0	It's a lot more than what you've come up with. What evidence do you have that indicates the Iraq population wasn't heavily armed? As for the Taliban, you're confusing Afghanistan with Iraq.	This isn't evidence, this is an opinion piece made by someone with an agenda. Come back when you have something of substance. Your argument is moot. The Iraq population wasn't heavily armed, only the Taliban and soldiers.
0	Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves.	The facts speak for themselves, and no amount of geneticist/darwinist hand-waving is going to change what they say.
1	I guess we just haven't shaken all of our Imperialist ways.

0	There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored. Those that haven't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about. There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred.

A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens.

0	obama has 1 thing that palin certainly doesn't have is the fantastic ability to turn crowds in favor of him. obama has amazing speech abilities that surpasses palin without a doubt in my mind. palin also likes to go off subject almost as if she is avoiding certain questions.  what is experience if you cannot even thoroughly explain your position?	i never said we have to vote for her. if it came between her and hillary, i'd vote hillary... actually, i'd probably vote bob barr. but it's unfair to say she doesn't have enough experience when she certainly does (or, at least more than obama did).

A year later, he was forced to make peace after devastating the Roman countryside...but NOT Rome itself.He died a year later in 453AD.	Even in the case of the Romans, such practices as decimation eventually led to their downfall. When Atilla marched on rome, he started with less than 2000 men. He picked up hundreds of thousands on the way through, people dissatisfied with the Roamsn policies.

0	Not all evolution takes place over billions of years. There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time. "bacteria, birds etcs."Natural selection occures frequently. You can "observe" evolution through the fossile record, DNA, morphology etcs.Evolution has made predictions, these predictions have come true, ergo, it's good.	#1 - How are we now able to observe evolution, when the evolution of the world supposely took billions of years?

That has happened before even in Japan as well as other countries including here. No conclusion to be drawn. It happened, it is history and now a well known fact.

0	up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms.	morality, in the strictest sense of the word, deals with that which is innately regarded as right or wrong. the term is often used to refer to a system of principles and judgments shared by cultural, religious, and philosophical concepts and beliefs, by which humans subjectively determine whether given actions are right or wrong.  you do know the difference between right and wrong don't you? i see no reason teachers shouldn't play a part in attempting to teach pupils the difference.

For a while I had personhood at 4 years of age, but today, looking back, I did not have personhood until I was 6.

Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts, and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament, certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century. I don't whether it is "generally accepted" that the text was altered, it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general.

That's all.	Court: Seattle police OK to stun pregnant womanBy GENE JOHNSON ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITERSEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she'd be admitting guilt.Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. One reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her.The officers - Sgt. Steven Daman, Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street.Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the Taser. She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue. He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks' rights were clearly violated.But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: "It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation."They also noted that the force used wasn't that serious because the Taser was in "touch" mode rather than "dart" mode, which hurts more. They reversed the lower court's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit.The officers' lawyers, Ted Buck and Karen Cobb, said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced."Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders," Buck said. That's all the court recognized today. The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances."The majority's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon, who called it "off the wall.""I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks, let alone three activations of a Taser, in response to such a trivial offense," she wrote.She argued that under Washington law, the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody: Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense, and it's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest.Berzon said the majority's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves didn't make that legal argument. To obstruct an officer, one must obstruct the officer's official duties, and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her, check for warrants, write up the citation and give it to her. Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case."This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman, in front of an elementary school, at 8:30 in the morning, to someone who posed no threat whatsoever," he said.

Most evolutionists believe that matter and time were created by a "Big Bang."

The jewish people committed no crimes, they were simply made the villain and wiped out by the government.Illegal immigrants are not indigenous to the country, are committing various crimes against the country and the people, putting us at massive risk, and doing parasitic harm to the nation. The law passed doesn't authorize their death, it just cracks down on them being here illegally.There's absolutely no comparison between what Germany did, and what Arizona is doing.

0	I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them).	Waiting until they are born likely gives them no more chance of surviving than killing them in the womb. What chance does an unexpecting child have against a grown person intent on killing him?

0	Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.	Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA.

1	I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.

0	Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.	Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?

0	Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.	I wrote a huge post on how animals emerge pre-adapted, and continue to adapt throughout their lifetimes. Do you not see how this could give the ILLUSION of evolution?

0	No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as "proof" of a young earth.	you might criticize me for believing evolution happened simply because scientists say it did, but alas, thats the reason why. anyway...

Whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story :P	The Violinist Argument: this was brought up in the 'I think abortion is OK to an extent' thread.

1	You would not celebrate Osama being out of the picture? Maybe not throw a party, but a not even a simple "yippee!"?   Yeah, right. What a load.	Like I said before I would not celebrate the death of any person...even osama bin laden. There may be evil men out there but to celebrate the death of an evil man is evil as well. It goes along the same lines as doing something evil to achieve good still makes you an evil person.

0	And what is an inheritance? Proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life. 15 Good understanding giveth favor 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid. What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure.	A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children...- Proverbs 13:22Sell that ye have and give alms...- Luke 12:33

0	And I would agree with you as long as all marriages for all couples were called civil unions and there is no two tiered system.	Well, at least they're trying to do it the right way, instead of finding some biased judges to render them some ruling.What I don't like though is the idea that civil unions can't be worked into a more doable institution. I'd love to see some sort of national full-benefits civil union system put in place for things like this.
0	Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there.	If you reject the literal account of the Creation in Genesis, you are saying that God is a liar!
1	Wow. I particularly like the part where you criticize someone for a lack of intelligence while making an elementary grammar mistake. It's you're not your.	Your pretty slow aren't you
0	Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by "higher" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.	However one thing that works against evolution is this. It is just amazing that every creature on this planet didn't evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another.

'and what does 'babies' mean? are you saying that unborn babies aren't really people?' yes, that's exactly what i am saying, and the science is behind my argument, not yours my friend. your personal, religious beliefs on the subject mean absolutely nothing to me. an unviable fetus is not a 'baby'.

You are too busy being a lemming and being led over the cliff with president Shrub (Molly Irvins -- GW is to small to be a Bush). ;)	No, you lose. You lose any respect as someone who has an iota of common sense and decency as an American. He was under attack because he had invaded Kuwait and we were in the process of throwing him out of Kuwait. There was no justification to be firing scuds at innocent Israelis who were not a part of that war. You don't have a clue; not a single clue about Saddam. You just parrot the typical left-wing crapola. And it's doubly sickening coming from an American.

0	So it is claimed.   Tiahrt Amendment Facts | ProtectPolice.org   I've noticed a pattern. Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so. They send a mixed message. It's happened before such as when the NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF. How can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better? It gives us a clue to what the gun lobby's true motives are. Truly disturbing.	tiahrt to holder: read the tiahrt amendment before drawing false conclusions
0	If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.	If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money.

0	Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.	I don't think there are many, who consider the fetus a person in the way you are implying, that are still for abortion "rights".The debate is not if its ok to kill a human being because obviously your not going to get a huge debate on that but rather is the fetus a human being.
0	Accidents for one. Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Run a google search for "man shoots self" the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny. Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though.	People have claimed that owning a gun makes you more likely to be shot. Well, there is the risk of suicide, but I'm talking sane people here. So how would owning a firearm make the owner more likely to be shot? How would it make him more likely to be killed?

I can only collect SS if I pay into the system. My employer AND I pay for my family's healthcare. As for their tax-free status, I would have no problem removing it...just as I'd love to see the ACLU and other crackpot liberal organizations lose their tax-exempt status. emoticonXGood	__________________________________________________ _______________THE FOLLOWING ANALOGY IS PURELY HYPOTHETICAL, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT MY ACTUAL THOUGHTS ON CHRISTIANITY IN ANY WAY. I think Christianity is unnatural. I think belief in God is a disorder and sign of a mental defect, and the things they do behind closed doors, drinking "blood" and "eating flesh", ICK. It's a negative behaviour pattern that requires overcoming. That being said, I don't really have a problem with Christians, as long as I don't have to pay for their health benefits and pensions, not to mention all of their tax free enterprises. This whole dependent class of Christians is a huge drain on the atheist working population of the country and we should not be forced to pay for their benefits, let alone to recognize them as being equal. It's clear to me that they should be denied these benefits due to these "facts". __________________________________________________ _______________
1	human is defined by whether or not you have a funeral, included in the census, and pay something to the state? a homeless illegal alien is screwed.	if its alive then you should have a funeral for every miscariage, and you should include it in the census and pay accordingly to the state. if not, it isn't a human.
0	if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex.	perhaps. but which would you rather have: promiscuity without protection or with? the distinction can matter, so if there is going to be promiscuity going on, i for one would perfer to see it be safe-sex, as much as possible. but even better would be if a person not being promiscuous at all, imo anyway.
0	Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone "up there" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify.	My moral compass does not care if genesis is literally true or not. Can anyone explain why it should?

1	And have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my "soul mate." Yeah. I'm thinking if they're willing to make me go through that they're not a soul mate at all. >_>	You have obviously been told this by a pro-choicer who will leap to any rationale no matter how shallow in order to justify his/her defense for abortion. He fails to appreciate that preventing an egg from being fertilized is not at all similar to murdering a fetus which is in many cases at a minimum of up to 3 months of development. Hi Ryuuichi, If I might defend your doctor for a second, I think I can explain his thinking. He/she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs. old MIGHT be very different than what you will want when you are in your 20s and in love with your potential soul mate. At that time, when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together, if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children, he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse. See the difference? To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day. Very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children. In fact, I can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make. Think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point, I'm sure. emoticonXAngel
0	Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent.	Consider an extreme literalist, asked to put the two Genesis accounts side by side and then asked, "according to the two accounts, on what day was man created?" Everyone not a literalist can see that the two accounts conflict when read literally. But I've known literalists say, "I see no contradiction" - and they meant it.
0	Well of course everybody is entitled. But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color, using the "black codes" enacted after the Civil War. If it weren't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution, minorities would still be out in the cold.The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment.	We've already been over this and again you're confusing two separate issues. I think everyone is agreed that people no matter what race are entitled to equal protection under the law.
0	Thanks, Clive, you're a good sport. Of course I can't agree with the idiot part. Rash, unwise, unknowledgeable, maybe, but not fools.	No. Anyone who sticks to beliefs that a god created the earth just 6,000 years ago is an idiot. People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the "idiot" label.Hope this clarifies things for you. emoticonXAngel

0	But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).	then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of, in the worst case, chaos and, in the best case, a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority.

Hi Lisa - I disagree with you. Babies can't be helped while trivializing and restricting mothers and not recognizing their needs. There are reasons women choose to abort and those need to be addressed and there will also be cases where women need to abort (health concerns, rape, etc.).
0	Well, since you have natural selection completely wrong, it must not go too well with the Biblical account. By the way, now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context. What is a "kind." Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a "kind." Please show why a "kind" only has the ability to lose information.	This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.

0	Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.	I disagree. Well maybe technically. Let's look at it this way. Criminals' access to guns may even go slightly up, because there are SOME criminals who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally. But the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than that of criminals, thus less criminals will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person living there owning a gun. Criminals may forget getting a gun anyway so maybe indirectly, but the major problem is access to guns, not ownership of guns. Access will go up, no one disputes that, but people using them for self-defense goes much higher so that more than makes up for the increase in access for criminals. Make sense?

0	Why do conservatives support conservatives? Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas. Luke doesn't have him meet a risen Jesus only Paul says he did. His first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with Barnabas.But the Apostles did not teach the same as Paul, similiar but not the same.	ecause of his direct encounter with Christ in a special way. It is not necessary that all the apostles should be equally inspired to only write teachings and letters like Paul, just like all the organs of a body do not take part of the same the function, but the nevertheless, all contribute to the making and building of the body.
0	And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?	I'm not sure what you mean. Your quotes from dictionaries certainly give no indication of any blurring. I'll give you another definition acceptable to biologists.Natural selection is the process by which organisms well adapted to their environment survive to produce offspring while those more poorly adapted may not. In this way, particular combinations of genes are propagated differentially.

0	Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called "womens issuses" be in valid?	The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves.This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.

Section. 8.I just love how Liberals like to twist this to mean that it's the government's responsibility to care for us via food (food stamps), income (welfare checks), Medicaid/Medicare/S-Chip, etc.
0	it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.	so why did toe ignore horizontal gene transfer for so many decades? can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally (without going through selection) validates darwinism, which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted?
0	there's a fair few problems with this. off the top of my head... what happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child? what consequences would there be for a mother who didn't want to give the name of the father? would there be any? why is only the father punished? having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people. if it isn't consensual, rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs, why punish only one of the consenting individuals? on a more fundamental level: what evidence do you have that having an abortion is 'a mortal sin'? why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept?	so.. eh?? hows this sound? will it fly with conservatives and progressives? i think so. -mosheh thezion emoticonxhoho

0	So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?  Your statement "An abortion never has to be done" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?	Mr. Jack, Abortion doesn't have to be done if the amniotic sack is cut. An abortion never has to be done.
1	Only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakicetus_(1).jpg  Replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why I put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy.	the question was about whales. pay attention will you? you're right; i didn't type anything in at all. i just asked huntard to prove his claim. but in response to your propaganda piece, here's some opposing evidence. the third problem, 'as zimmer acknowledges', is that there aren’t very many early whale fossils. does that surprise you? evolutionists have probably led you to believe that the fossil evidence for whale evolution is, pardon the expression, rock-solid. but there isn’t really that much 'hard' evidence. whale evolution is mostly imaginary, or speculative at best. since whales are mammals, evolutionists imagined that a land-going mammal must have returned to the sea. at first, they imagined this without any fossil evidence. so, they went looking for fossils to support their preconceived ideas. the first hint that they were probably right came in 1983, when researcher phil gingerich found a 52-million year old skull in shallow deposits in pakistan. although fragmentary, the skull had teeth that were nearly identical with those of mesonychids and the archaeocetes. … despite the whale-like characteristics of the skull, however, pakicetus lacked two important adaptations which are present in modern whales. in living whales, the ears contain large sinuses that can be filled with blood, allowing the animal to maintain pressure while diving. modern whales also transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear using a 'fat pad', which allows them to hear directionally underwater. pakicetus lacked both of these features, indicating that it was unable to dive deeply and that it could not hear well underwater. these anatomical clues meshed well with its habitat, since the pakicetus bones were found in deposits that had been laid down at the mouth of a river on the shore of a shallow sea, where the opportunities for deep diving would be limited. although no post-cranial bones of pakicetus were found, it seemed logical to assume, from the teeth and ear structure, that the animal spent a great deal of time in shallow water looking for food, but returned to the land to rest, somewhat like a modern sea lion. … the earliest known cetacean, pakicetus, demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans are descended from the mesonychid carnivores. although we have not found any post-cranial bones from pakicetus yet, ... 5 consider what this evolutionist has just told us. first, they haven’t found any post-cranial bones of pakicetus. [since this essay was written, they have found some post-cranial bones.] post-cranial bones are bones below the skull. so, all they have found is a skull. they don’t have a single pakicetus rib. they don’t have any pakicetus vertebrae. no other bones of any kind. just a skull--and a fragmentary one at that. why do they think it came from a whale ancestor? because its teeth look like whale teeth. but when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater. the skull was found in association with other fossils that lived on the bank of a river or along the sea shore. yet it “demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans [whales] are descended from the mesonychid carnivores.” in a whale of trouble so the claim is made based only on the teeth because no other evidence supports such a conclusion. that's real complete and reliable information that justifies making such an absolute claim from. not!!! emoticonxdonno

0	when i was in high school lots of the kids stole stuff all the time... stuff their parents didn't want to buy them, peer pressure etc. i'm not trying to be an ass either i'm just surprised at your views on this...  maybe i'll make a debate and we can see what people on here think.	i don't think lindsay lohan is a good example of any group of people... when i was younger i worked in retail and thieves were everywhere... they just stole because they wanted stuff they couldn't afford. depends on what they were stealing while you worked in retail. and even if they did steal them, did they steal them to have them or to sell them for cash they could use on things they needed? you wouldn't know unless you followed their tracks after they stole. not to be a complete ass, but what you're saying sounds a lot like the corporate propaganda i've been hearing for years that encourages our culture to take a giant shit on the poor and law-breakers.

1	About a third of the weapons seized in Mexico were referred to the U.S. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   About half were successfully traced. Better than 90% of those to U.S. dealers.   Of course your definition of "minute" might differ from mine.	You mean just like the continually debunked lie of "95% of all weapons found in Mexico came from America"? The lie that not even the ATF will stand behind? The lie that was purported based on successful traces of the minute number of weapons Mexico turned over to be traced and identified, while keeping the vast majority from law enforcement?

0	please clarify what you're saying here as it makes no sense to me. what point are you trying to make ? off the top though, any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible doesn't condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act/lifestyle. and who does the anti-defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it.	you don't think we could find denizens of stormfront who would claim that they don't hate black people but they think it is sinful for white and black people to have relationships, and then point to, say, the anti-defamation league and accuse them of hatred?
0	I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.	For those who are pro-life, how much of a role does your belief in a soul (assuming you hold such beliefs) play into your views on abortion? To explore this, would your views on a particular abortion change if you knew for certain that a particular fetus has no soul?The reason I bring this up is that, for those of us with largely secular views, the idea of the soul is closely analogous to our idea of mental existence, sentience, etc. I suspect, therefore, that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy. I know that, apart from that arguement, you value potential more than we do. However, I suspect that concepts of the soul do play a role in the views of most on the pro-life side. Would you be willing to discuss such ideas?
1	This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)	1d. A union between two persons having the customary but usually not the legal force of marriage: a same-sex marriage.
0	So atheism doesn't "need" facts? If it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution, doesn't it need all the facts? If the answer is no, then how can it argue against religion? Miller didn't explain it.	Religion= faith in a deity or deities (rough definition)  Atheism= lack of religion/deities  Therefore, atheism= lack of faith    There is no "faithful" beginning point of atheism.

0	The point is that there are plenty of issues that go on in church meetings and denominational conventions that are areas of enormous disagreeement and struggle. It happens--it's not just this issue. You just don't hear about them because the press isn't interested in those issues.	"isn't controversial"? It "isn't controversial" because the vast majority of Christian sects HAVE NO PROBLEM with it. It's "not controversial" because the christians aren't making it controversial.
0	Strawman. The argument is not to do whatever one wishes with ones body. The argument is soley that one does not have to have another attached, ever, against ones will.	The simple fact is, in a civilized society no one has the freedom to do whatever she wants with her own body. Liberty unfettered by morality is the operative rule of anarchy, not civilization. At any given moment, each of us is constrained by hundreds of laws reflecting our moral responsibilities to our community. The most primal of those rules is the obligation of a mother to her helpless child. This is one of the reasons the public outcry against Susan Smith was so intense.
0	Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.	You may not have intended to, but you've given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes, with regards to her family - and you'd stick out of it, regardless.
0	Yes. The assumption happens to be that maybe the bible isn't literal. "Lets look into ourselves, shall we?" Behold we did, and Lo! The Earth is old!

0	Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.	(Playing devil's advocate)And, by what authority would you deny a woman's "right to choose" an abortion that happens to be "late in her pregnancy?"
0	One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord.	I like how the Chinese view Christians. They simply cannot figure out why so many missionaries go over to China and try to convert people. The Chinese are so lenient about religion that many practice several different religions and don't have such strict codes as Christianity.
0	And were THIS the 17th century, I might understand that, but this is the 21st century. We don't "bleed" people to make them well; we don't have barbers performing surgery and we usually have a trained physician in the delivery room.	They used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered."During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all births ended in the mother's death as a result of exhaustion, dehydration, infection, hemorrhage, or convulsions. Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children, her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8. This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth."
0	Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today.	Note also this false statement from a ""Survival of the fittest" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. This is not circular or tautologous. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified [Weiner 1994]."http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.htmlThis is quite clearly wrong as Darwin did use it in the 6th ed of Species.

1	I guess I am just "psychologically conditioned" to be blue eyed.?	apparently, these "underlying preferences" are of absolutely no effect, since the psychological conditioning  of the individual overrides any other "built-in" trait factor. therefore these "built-in" trait factors are useless in practicality, because nothing about the individual's identity is influenced by them. so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist?

Probably not.
0	And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you.

1	shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such.	a very good argument for getting the government out of 'marriage'. let the various religions deal with / define 'marriage' as the wish to believe. the government should only deal with 'civil unions', regardless of the gender of the individuals involved.

0	what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny.	i can't protect my family from extended family interference without marriage. i can't designate who will receive my social security benifits without marriage. i can't protect my partner from having to pay 50% inheritence taxes on a property she already owns without marraige. i can't live in an assisted living center with my partner if/when that time should come, without marriage.  i can't get married to my partner in mass. and leave the area and have our marriage recognized in anyother state, without legalize federally recognized, completely 100% portable marriage!  in short, you're full of carp.  there are almost 1,100 rights, protections and priveledges that are given to 'married' couples, who almost alway take them for granted, which are flat out denied to gay/lesbian couples.

0	have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution.	personally i don't give rats rear end about your god - neither he, you, the government or the ignoramous in rome will ever have say in what happens to this body. yes there are - and as long as you continue to trivialize and disregard them you will not to a damned thing to reduce abortion.

1	'lame apologetics'? well, i guess if you say so, with your invincible assurance of being right whenever you open your mouth, it would be futile to contradict you.  at least you haven't accused me of being 'prejudiced' against science.  james.	your christian apologetics are noted. nowhere are you able to defend christianity marching against the heathen. sorry, but your apologetics are lame.
1	Then why does god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in Hosea 13:16.What did they ever do to god?Does god fear these people so much he has to have unborn members of their community killed. Un born members who couldn't have possibly done anything to god!	We really are going around in circles on this........My bible through the RCC and Jesus Christ says all life is sacred including that life in the womb.........
0	Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior. Abstinence until marriage is still the best way.	Wait a minute, I fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not.
0	But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done.	That does not mean, however, that we should refrain out of politeness from making statements of established scientific fact just because a listener might have been exposed to contradictory religious beliefs. It is not the job of science to fix or accommodate the inaccuracies of religion. Within science classrooms, science is and should remain pre-eminent, so that people can make informed decisions.
0	ridiculous. if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong. daewoo: ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind. id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. it failed. michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic.	you behave as if i have to demonstrate that no ider has ever tried to use ic to support id. i do not and i have made no claims that one could not. 'the two points within the video do actually disprove what you said. you said that ic cannot be used to support id. when in fact, the video states very clearly that id/creationists use the argument of ic to support their 'theory.' (the two points being cases where the video indicates that iders try to use ic to prove id) all i said is that they cannot. so i ask you again can one support id with ic? youtube - fallacy of id and creationism-false dichotomy [reloaded]
1	fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. that is you doing the same damn thing, hypocrite.	i'm here to debate not argue, or 'disrespect people by calling them idiots', that only shows your true nature (so called person of god). did you ever wonder why you have such a low disapproval rating in your debates with many so people on this site? look no farther then your comments.
0	So parthenegenic births are always female. Where did the X chromosome come from? Is this another case of "POOF, it was a miracle" when faced with reality?	If god could create the world in 7 days then he sure as hell could get someone pregnant.
0	Folding proteins... Show me where and how this happens. Why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another? If this is happening all the time we'd see more mutations all the time.Good theory you've got there. Saying something can happen doesn't mean that it does!	A chance mutation can do this by insertion. The codons for one protein are inserted or appended to the codons of of another. This is especially likely if the genes are near eachother. Another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins. Two proteins can fold such that they interact because of their shape. If the proteins interlock or attach, they can form new combined structures.
1	Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbor's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competance.	You're trying to get the best of both worlds here. You're angry that people believe in a God that tells them what to do. Now, you're advocating that this is what God should do. He established laws for the Jews. Unsatisfied with just 10, they kept saying "oh, sure, but what about in this situation, and this situation, and what about this..."
1	Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?	Oh, so now it's a fetus? In your other posts it was a "baby" CUNx.
