0	the government has no business invading into the private, legal activities of two individuals. and how is requirement able to defeat straw purchasers? if you don't feel comfortable making the sale, don't make it. it's as simple as that.	i expect them to go to someone who can make sure the transaction isn't illegal one way or the other.
1	THe religious reigh is not mainstream either. And frankly, you are also confusing politics and religion. You do KNOW that there is a difference? You also know there is a differnece between hateful proclimations and scholarship, don't you??	The liberal left is not mainstream, Trebor.
0	If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food, why not spare pain and abort?	You have no idea whether the unborn will be 'unhappy', or even poor, for their lifetime.
0	that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran, mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni.  so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before(iraq) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat(aq) and unrelated nation.	well, latest word is that the alphabet soup is taking the threat seriously.
0	It doesn't make sense because no one makes that claim. There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution. That does not mean that evolution is random.	And the reason they say that -- one of them -- is that NS on the level of the population is random....which makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever.
1	So, a forty year old having sex with a twelve year old is ok then?	I suppose they are really asking for the minimum age of consentual age to be lowered/removed.
0	Did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.	You see all the straight people know that whatever ther gays get, they will want more..and you just proved it.
0	There are no objective reasons to condemn gays. Marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it.My advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions, believe me I have lost alot of support from conservatives for this, perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes.	And what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if I may ask?I'm assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably don't pertain to you well, cause your not gay....
1	if i were a virgin it wouldn't insult me that you called me such a meaningless terminology. ignoring that nonsensical 'insult', i shall simply call you a man-whore and move along. as for the answer to the question, i will ask you why you try so hard to contribute constructively to a website that rewards you with nothing. oh dear, man-whore, that 'virgin' just burst your ego, what will you ever do?	perhaps more the point is that you're too scared to ask yourself the question: 'why do i care so much about getting points for doing absolutely nothing on a site that gives me no reward?'
1	Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?	I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy.
0	Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago (a real cave, not one of the commercialized ones). Bats actually have better eyesite than humans, but even they can't see in pitch black. No eye can.	In my opinion, this guy is basically saying that if you had a bunch of bricks and mortar, a building could be built.
0	This is why the title is "God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle :)	So the definition that began this thread that God is identified as"the greatest being possible" must limit the possibilities to a finite number.As I write this I can see that it's self-evident - but what I can't see is howthis gets us any closer to showing that God exists (or not) !
0	They are safer. The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then.Let's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies. Only 13% of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them, Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30, and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack, with severe punishments for the seal being broken.	Recently liberals in Switzerland were successful in passing a mandate that militia members are no longer allowed to keep their service weapons and ammunition at home.They're no longer safe because of these pansies having their way.
1	Having politicians monitor their ethics is much like having the mafia monitor crime.	money .... Why do you think Congress is so reluctant to pass ethics bills?
1	Now I read this and thought there are two ways I could describe you:1) You are very poorly read in history.or2) Why don't you give a damn about the born? at what point does that defenseless little child become second in your concerns to the unborn?I'm intrigued, I really am.	Abortion is killing a defenseless, helpless, innocent baby in the womb....It is the most barbaric crime one human being can perpetrate on another
0	Lots of makers are still churning out lever action rifles. I am sad to see Winchester closed, but sad feelings is not a good financial reason to keep a poorly run company open.	The venerable Winchester line of guns is no more, despite a heroic two month effort to find a buyer.I have a hard time believing someone will not try to resurrect the name, but perhaps it's best to let it die away.
0	Heart bypass, prostate cancer.......I have a couple of Canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to Bellingham Wash and had the Surgery within 2 weeks............	What are you counting as critical?
1	I typically don't read Antonia's propaganda pieces, so is she holding up the UK as a shining example of dental health? If so, I suggest that she ask a typical Brit to smile, so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion. The US' "bubbas" have better teeth than the average Brit. emoticonXRolleyes	So baby how about those poor folks in Britain pulling their own teeth because of lack of healthcare?
0	Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?	There will be fewer of them PER INSURED.
0	Because it's a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it.	Just because 99% of scientists believe in evolution, why should I?
1	so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal?!?!? what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional? oh yeah, i forgot, the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want. so screw the will of the people, just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism.	that's in the last two years, not eight years ago, when the odious, unconstitutional prop.
0	'would the french accept people singing the la marseillaise in english as a sign of french patriotism? of course not,' there are so many flaws in this comparison it is unbelievable. firstly, there are virtually no french citizens for whom english is their first language. second, english isn't the national language of the us, nor is it a language that evolved there. a better comparison would be la marseillaise translated into bretagne, or translating 'oh canada' into french.	what i would like to know is when w, the 'decider', is going to learn english?
0	Do you believe that the freedom to not participate in any religion whatsoever is not covered by the expression "Freedom of Religion"?	Simone:Sorry, but that's not in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
0	We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead	There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try :p
0	it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes.	this is unsurprising to most rational folk, but yet we still hear the pro-gun clarion call to have no new gun laws, etc.
0	Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that "incipient organ" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying "what good is half a wing." Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does "fully functional" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.	(6) Natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds, but actually tends to preserve the present kinds, since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no "survival" value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning.
1	oh yeah, it's a real brain teaser. who would have thought it's possible for someone to have two parents?	wow, you actually butchered this brain teaser stripping it of all of it's purpose.
0	But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.	you see, the thing is that not everybody agrees with some of the theories that usually accompany evolution (including Big Bang, abiogenesis, etc) that try to answer the question "how come existence".
1	Excuse me?! Didn't AIDS started because your homies either ate or did the nasty with monkeys, thereby crossing the species boundary? What did it have to do with "da man"? And crime and poverty in Africa is also the white devil's doing? emoticonXConfused	AIDS, crime and poverty only started with the influence of whites trying to establish their culture in africa
0	Actually, this data point is perfectly meaningless.NONE of the other information (or the conclusions) presented in this talk require "26".If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No.A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors.	“An application of the present results to the [Milky Way] Galaxy yields one supernova per 26 (± 10 estimated error) years in very good agreement with the evidence from historical supernovae.” G.

1	Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, "....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically." you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence.	If grammatically meant "with proper grammar", then there would be no need to say "grammatically correct".
1	uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!	sure keep guns ok..., we will..., thanks..., but..., we were planning on keeping them even if you disapproved.
1	After Rump Limpballs and his XXXXX followers started calling me a "Feminazi", I was granted a license to call TeaBaggers TeaBaggers.	or does the simple mention of the term somehow convey some mystical argument defeating power?2: Regardless of how unsavory the means I don't think desperation prompted grave robbing equates to asking for a handout.

0	so you argue that for some women, abortion is the 'easy way out', and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? could you please reiterate these reasons here (preferably in an enumerated list) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? indeed. but we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.  so i'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?	1. i think a lot of women take take the easy way out when it comes to and abortion for the reasons i have stated over and over again.......... 2. what i said was it seems you can't pick up the newspaper these days and not see a case of where some woman has abandoned a new born baby in a trash can or dumpster.......it never use to be that way..........
1	The egg is now a conscious human? In under 72-hours? Wow.	You all are missing the point that the morning after pill is abortion (or rather could be).
0	And you believe that to be what? You really need to just say who/what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.	For the sake of discussion let's say it is the same one all the signers of the Declaration of Independence agreed it was.

1	I find it funny you think Article V was repealed yet the bill of rights references Article V for passage.   So we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but Article V which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? You've really lost it haven't you.	If you can repeal the BOR, any one of them there is nothing to stop you from repealing the Articles either is there?
0	I think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well. I think that is where the majority of this problem lies.

0	The same ones you've been told about, what, a few dozen times now? :)A small exerpt:	And what fossil records can you show that one species of animal has evolved into another species of animal?
0	False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself.	Any random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system.
1	Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.	For instance; they have many pages dedicated to the history, derivation and definition of the word "species".
0	So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?	The topic of this thread is "15 myths about gun control" But you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual...
1	It's also hard to convince a rational person that something is so if there is zero evidence of its truth, but then you wouldn't have any clue about that.	People have been trying for centuries.
0	well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.	So, in other words, you an intelligent actor weed out the programs that don't look like anything that resembles a living thing.
1	That's the difference between liberals and conservatives (AKA "real Americans.) Conservatives have a sense of humor. Liberals don't.	Something about it doesn't scan well - I think it's because the 'voice' isn't developed enough to make it sound absurd.

0	You do not have a right to drive. No one does. Driving is not a right. The state does not owe it to you to give you a license to drive. The activity of driving is a priveldge granted by the state, not a right.Rights are not regulated by government. You have them and no earthly authority can take it away from you. The state never gave me my rights, I already had them, nor do I have to ask for permission to exercise them.	What objective standard are you using to determine what I do and do not have a right to do?
1	wow, these are some very nice values, lets teach them to everyone else! if the bible says so, why not? you seem determined to debate about a book of flawed values. are you sure you are defending this book of it's values? because surely you must have some kind of religious point of view to even think of protecting a piece of old literature.	not to mention the child slaves... i've explained one times too many times why it's a sensible thing to do in ancient times.
1	Wait until Gen. Petraus' report comes out, then you'll eat those words. BTW, do you take ketchup or mustard with that? ;)	There is no chance of winning.

1	Modest as well I see. You haven't answered my question at all. If you are going to wander into a thread like this and make such a comment as follows:	I believe I am a man of high principles and moral values, now if you don't have any other questions of me can we get back on topic........I believe I have answered your question...........Thanks........
0	I believe in a strict interpretation of the Constitution, this makes me neither a liberal or conservative. The SN was inspired by VOR who kept signing his posts with quotes from Karl Marx.	a pro-gunner with the SN of "marxismismurder" conservative was a pretty safe bet.
0	actually, the only valid question plotter asked is about the existence of dinosaurs (How did they fit into the creation schedule?) Good question plotter...Plotter: "when did he create all the other planets, when did he create all the other stars and comets?"Gen. 1:14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so. and XQ, what stories are you talking about?	Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize (lie) what God actually did, for God was done with everything then started again.
1	What facts? The article above your post is replete with documented facts. Are you in denial? Have you even read the article? Are all of your responses knee-jerk, shoot-from-the-hip defense mechanisms?Pay attention.	I see more whining on the Conservative side then the libral side.
0	Are those thousand people directly and immediately threatening to rape you, to kill you? Up close and personal? I will retain my right to self defense. I bet you would, too.	If killing were an act of justice I could take upon myself, I would probably kill about a thousand people already.
0	Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers? That's a statement of faith.	In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there is nothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science.
0	Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree. Correlation is not causation.	What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates.
0	So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning!	Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights.

0	So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence.	So what activates genes?When a gene product is needed, a signal from its environment, not an emergent property of the gene itself, activates experession of that gene.
0	i am familiar with both men; and my posts sound very lockean, which if you really knew locke you would know is true. remember previously in this thread (that is, when you were travelling these parts as 'bhbcu64') where i said that there is no right to control one's body? or where i said there is no right to suicide? that is locke 101.	matthew, though i doubt phyllis is aware of either man, her posts sound more like rousseau than locke.
0	Not entirely true. While we can't disprove that God created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. For example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old.	The reason for that is, that Creationism can never be proved or disproved.
0	gitmo is a media darling. nobody talks about abu ghraib. and it is still in operation see what the obama admin thinks about closing that one. not a fucking word. enjoy the grandstanding.	gitmo' i happen to think closing a camp that engaged in torture and the prolonged detainment of 'terrorists' without trial was one of his best choices so far.
0	?? What are you trying to say?Science is knowledge, all knowledge, that is, anything we find to be true. There is no other "truth" out there, if there were, we'd be omniscient.	This is their words as nothing science has "proven" overturns anything the Bible says.
0	Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.	Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly.
0	Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation.	tell me this and ask as many questions as you want, I can answer and truthfully.

0	Why is saying that many things conflict with the well being of Society at large and bans them to the disappointment of those who endorse such activities. Consider rape, murder, incest and sodomy as good historical examples of such taboo activities, taken by you as an inditement of all gay people JSD ? You seem to take any moral stance or argument I make very personally, as if I'm accusing you of being those things. You work very hard to read into, demonize and condemn everything I say as if it is intended as a personal attack. You really need to work on that.	And you wonder why "bigot and homophobe" come up so much in response to your posts?
1	Some slightly earlier history shows that Clinton wasn't quite that worried about Bin Laden. In 1996, the CIA had Bin Laden pinpointed on a ranch in Afghanistan. It needed permission ONLY from the Clinton White House (not Congress) to vaporize it - it was in the middle of nowhere. An official from the "United Arab Emirates" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!	President Bill Clinton was very worried about Osama bin Laden well before 9/11 and HE GAVE EXPLICIT WARNINGS ABOUT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND TERRORISM TO GEORGE WALKER BUSH AND HIS PEOPLE DURING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIONS.

0	I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few.	Heh, well we'll see how long they can do it.
1	Steeeeve?Do yourself a favor and stop fantasizing about my opinion, 'mmkay?I don't believe you are like that.This junk you do where you refuse to address what I DO say and make up strawman arguments gets you nowhere...I understand you're getting angry, but YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...Let me repeat that. Hopefully it will sink in?YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...With that said, I return you to your delusions...	You know, your comments make me and probably symbiote angry.
0	really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?	i think you've been reading too much george orwell, you've come up with new speak for science.
1	Not only is everyone in agreement, which scares me enough, but Parcum even agrees with me. This is really shocking!!!! :)	They obviously didn't help us at all.
0	my dear, i can see the wood for the trees. no-one expects perfect parents, but no parent should dictate school policy. and this guy was a bad example.	maybe you should subtitle this thread: the right to a school with perfect parents.
1	i love how scumbarge doesn't give a rebuttal to this. he knows you have him by the balls.	why don't you post what they have said, since, apparently you have and must (therefore) know where to look to find it ;)
0	I wouldn't say most cjurches, because you cannot prove that. There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks.	Joe, this is no surprise....This Pope is a very conservative one and like it or not the Roman Catholic church and most churches believe the sexual act that gays commit a sin as they would any other sin.........The church believes love the sinner but hate the sin..........That will never change my friend
1	no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!	to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that?
1	You're somehow right despite the fact that all reliable evidence is on our side? What idiocy.	just because its broken doesnt mean Im wrong.
1	And here it is, corrected to remove that little hint of sensationalism that you feel is needed to drum up support for your cause.	Pictures of aborted babies (Warning: Graphic content - do not click on the link if you think you might be offended):
0	And this is a terrific breakthrough. My partner and I are coveered by my company's health insurance, and the state of Connecticut honors our Civil Union. That being said, I still have to pay tax on my partner's health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union.So it has to be marriage. Full and without exception.Civil Unions are not enough when we are treated differently under the law.	I am now covered under my partner's state sponsored (he's a state worker) health insurance.
1	###!! You're seriously advocating allowing kids to take guns to school? Don't you have enough greiving parents already without giving kids the option to shoot out a disagreement?	Gun Free School Zones ActThere's nothing reasonable about this law, this law has even made it possible for the worst school massacres of the 20th and 21st centuries to take place, by ensuring all the victims couldn't shoot back.
1	And yet after investigating for over a year, our inspectors agree with me, not you. Hmmm.	Anyone with an iota of common sense knows that he had them, he used them and he hid them.The problem is that you are a complete XXXXX.
1	But what makes them any different from ant hills or beaver dams? skyscrapers are natural because humans are a part of nature and they built them.	There are many man-made substances that are not found in nature at all.
1	I don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one.	How many people would be capable of doing that to themselves?
1	Sorrowfully, you are so right. That's exactly why we have all "suffered" for 8 long years. Sheer. . . . .no I refuse to write it!! :)	I would bet if we required a satisfactory score on a politcal knowledge test to vote for our leaders, we would see an entirely new crop of politicians in Washington.
0	personally i can't stand it when someone uses 'lol'. it's usually used derisively when politeness suggests that leaving it out and responding politely is in order. personally i'm surprised at this thread. the author apparently didn't read the faq.	when you start substituting u for you and r for are you just look stupid, but everyone seems to understand and use lol frequently.
0	The human collective is the authority. One major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.	this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air
1	why would you think such an absurd concept. corporations don't cast a vote in an election do they? why not?  does a corporation have a mind of it's own that it may look to it's interests in it's attempts to influence legislation? no, it permits individuals to overcome finance laws and exercise greater influence than is normally permitted for an individual. should your car have rights? you pay a tax for it. how about your house? pay a tax for that also every year.	if that's the case, then we should alsdo eliminate corporate taxes and only have 'natural persons' pay taxes since corporations would be taxed without representation.
1	Ok, so you utterly missed the whole religion vs. faith part of the discussion, got it.	it takes faith to believe that a complex organ such as a pancreas or an eye could arise from randomness..
1	I see -- in your opinion is it is "illegitimate", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance.	It is a right that has been interpreted by Courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process.
0	The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)	the laws of logic are non-material, universal, unchanging, and absolute
1	Did I mention premarital or adulterous heterosexual sex?  I think not!  As usual 'big' boy is putting words in others posts!  Was better when I was on his ignore list..for about five minutesemoticonXConfused	so, premarital heterosexual sex is not a sin.
1	ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation.	good grief, to suggest that the god who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is, frankly, as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the bible that condones, allows, or supports any and every abortion that occurs.
1	Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.	Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it.
0	And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother.	It's much easier to sit and say, "don't have an abortion" than to stand up and say "here's how I will help you so you don't have to have an abortion".
0	I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child.I fully intend to have children in the future, including through adoption possibly. When I do I will love them with all my heart and put their needs above my own. I'm not going to do a half-assed job of parenting; I'll give it 100%.But not yet.Prototype:	If you can feel nothing remorseful from having your baby killed at all, then I pity the children you raise.
0	Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read.	In regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer.
1	i doubt you know enough about carl bogus speedy defense of bellesiles and his dependance on a flawed study by loftin which was also in turn defended by jack rakov who later apologized out of embarrasment? want to take a shot and drag this farther off topic and embarrass yourself and star gazer and any other adherents? you well know you are in the wrong ballpark as has been pointed out many times on this very board. keep clutching at straws you will never get enough to build that strawman. beating a dead horse is bad enough...all 9 justices agreed the right was individual in heller.	'[92] the result was a single sentence with a clarifying preamble: 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
1	There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value.	How pathetic they are not to appreciate that with all of the value and potential they see in themselves, that at one time they were exactly like these unborn children with the same mental existence they now claim is justification for their extermination.
1	How about he pulls it out from under the Ramadan tree and unwarps it rather than your Hitler Youth moment?	Sort of like him taking you to the DMV to get your driver's license.
0	There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out.	It means that as our medical technology has gotten progressively better, and a premature baby can survive outside the womb at earlier and earlier stages because of this, the point at which it is unethical and/or considered murder has gotten earlier.
1	i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin? if he is god, no one had to die for anything. he could blink his eyes and everything would be as he wanted!	god wants you to come to him, but on his terms, not yours.
0	Or that they tend to be better prepared, or even less willing to accept help from others or get breakdown cover. That's the trouble with these kind of stats, the interpretations are pretty open to debate.	Or just nicer people?
0	And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?	Or by not granting them to the child you are endangering the rights of the child carried by the woman.
1	i'm surprised to learn that you have the slightest idea about biology. also, your spelling and grammar is ever so much better in this post than your posts in another thread. how many of you are pretending to be a poster named vt?	a little lesson in biology told me that when the sperm meets the egg, it makes a zygote... that means that fertilization has occured... which means a life has begun (even the medical field and our government agree with this).
1	This, coming from an atheist. How consistently shallow of you. emoticonXRolleyes	Normal people can be spiritually fulfilled without any need for a co-dependent relationship with a "god".
1	I have. Yet I can`t seem to be able to do the creative math that will show that europe will become pre-dominatly muslim in any near future.	All one needs to do is to check the demographic data.
1	yes let's all cheer on the glorified shameless point-farming bitch of this site.	well this is nice to come back to- jc making serious debate.
0	Actually, my wife and I discuss evolution all the time. She's an evolutionary biologist. She did feel as if she had some duty to watch the show, just to stay on top of the sorts of things being said. She just has a low tolerance for willful stupidity. Which I totally understand. :)	LOL Kronus - my wife and I don't sit around the dinner table debating evolution either, she was shocked that people could be so intentionally ingnorant and zealous, supposedly in the name of Christianity.
0	No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se.	Just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world, doesn't mean that it is 100.00% certain, just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00% (say, 99.9999999%).
0	Well, it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material. That's rather impressive. Again, irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution, regardless of you trying to create that association. Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated, well that only shows one thing, namely that you are dishonest.	and some people were saying "They are just that close in showing how life could come from non-life."
0	Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?	This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce.
0	No it didn't, there's no suggestions for how to enforce background checks to stomp out straw purchases. Stop offering non-solutions.	Not if it were enforced and a suggestions for how the law could be better enforced are given in the report.
1	Anyone can "give consent". The issue is wether the parson is old enough to make that decission. I bet the children Michael Jackson raped gave their consent. Does that make it "allright"? Are the kids "mature enough" to take the consequences of those actions?	I'm not going to say "oh, well since the girl who got pregnant is still very young she should have an abortion", because if she gave her consent to having sex then she should be old enough and mature enough to having a child.
1	oh really? then please provide me with several links that prove i'm an idiot or shut the fuck up! considering you only have 30 points i'm not too sure just how much you could possible know about anyone on this site? come on dude! you're a troll and everyone knows it... stop your trolling, grow up and hang with the big dogs... if you can't then close your fucking troll account and go bye bye.	after looking at your posts, i'm not sure intelligence is gonna be your best argument... although, once the window came up i at least had the wherewithal to make sure my position was correct - ie - support = pencil and tag = pencil rather than say i support pencil in one and pen in the other...
1	oh yes those horrible wicked gays that will distroy families and consume morality as we know it.	everyone except those wicked, godless gays, naturally.
1	Anything that doesn't fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong?	So the article is of no use in drawing the aformentioned conclusion that homosexual couples are more monogamous than heterosexual ones, or vice-versa.
0	i think the the p. bagatti is the one that found the burial caves in 1873, not the bagatti who was working in the mid 40's. i have unable to get a copy of the original manuscript the leadership u describes. i think it is only in italian though. i am surprised that such a  'key discovery' from the 19th century is kept so quiet except by claims of an evangilical web site.	i suspect the author may have meant to say 'b.
0	Used against me? I never denied this. Surely you refer to this in terms of gay marriage. Considering I don't believe gay marriage is a right I don't see how my words do you any good.	What you say will be used against you.
1	she was never 'pro-gun' to you people. she was an anti. omg they reported on something. not exactly ready to help her reputation out before she was shot, though, were they? you have lots of bros that are lunatics. and one of them just shot and murdered 6 people, including a federal judge who was sitting on an immigration case and a congresswoman who opposed to arizona's immigration law. arizona: your land of cowgirl jan and cowboy sheriff joe.  i never heard of anyone who truly understood what a soul was, who thought they didn't need a mirror. i'm not surprised you think yourself at the level of god himself, able to judge who has a soul and who doesn't. it's the same psychology your bro with a gun just demonstrated.	what would we need with one when there's nothing wrong with our souls?
0	But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]	Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human.
0	Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said "minimal or negligable physical damage".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the "peg" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.	Are you sure about that?
0	The thing is the Dempski didn't provide any kind of testable or detectable definition about what information is either. He used vague but scienficially sounding terms to push his case. He knew it too.	Dempski uses information theory which uses log base 2 to support his claims about intelligent design.
1	Ah yes, your diversionary tactics. I am sure if I provided it, you would move the goal posts, or demand evidence that you know is not yet available.. So, since this thread is about Jesus, and if a 'historical' Jesus actually existed, where is your evidence besides religious articles, forgeries, and accounts taken from Christians?What?? No where to be found?? Gasp.	If you can't cough him up you'd better get a new mindset about what's going on in the universe.
1	Public policy? Takes waaaay too much thought. Now one can go to ballpark here and pay $8.50 for a half pound hot dog, smothered in thick layers of chili, cheese and grilled onions (2,200 calories, 55 grams of saturated fat, 1,600 milligrams of sodium). That's a no-brainer (literally).  Dono	the publics way too busy with important issues such gaining weight at fast food joints and spreading christian hypocrisy.
0	Then for you, you made the right decision at the time. I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child.	Yes, I certainly did consider these risks, and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion.
1	Because the gay personals are full of married straight men looking for discrete gay sex	What on earth makes you think that a gay men could succeed in seducing a straight man, and a lesbian could seduce a straight woman.Of course there always are exceptions.
1	I didn't think you had either the intellectual or logical ability to respond. :)	OK, take the quotation marks off the word insignificant and answer the question.
0	IF! But here's the thing, Mexico is making absolutely no attempt to truly stomp out the drug cartels, they're catering to them! Various political figures and police officers are on the take, they're getting massive amounts of bribe money from the cartels, stopping them would prove detrimental.	Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?
1	sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want.	just out of curiosity, please pick out your best one (just one, your best one) alleged contradiction from the gospels and let me see if it holds up to close scrutiny.
0	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will	So you do have free will to make your own choices, but God must "approve" those choices.
1	if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said.	so lets get this straight; you say it is fine to pick and choose which bits of the bible you accept, but it is not okay to try revisit passages in the light of other knowledge from outside the bible?
0	Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.	But for the sake of clarification can you tell me if you believe it possible that the rights of the being's inside the mother are being infringed upon?
1	Are you telling me liberals have jobs? You sure can't tell it by all the anti military/war protests, the flag burnings, you saw prior to the start of the war and by all the libs that post here 24/7........They are either unemployed or 12 year old kids out of school for summer vacation..........	Have you considered that there are some Liberals, who are retired from their jobs ?
0	would you cite the exact article for once in your life? i'm sick of seeing the main page day after day after day.	a full embassy is not expected, but it will be the first official u.s. prensence 1979. the announcement is scheduled for after the november election.
0	But the number of criminals that have firearms can be reduced. In developed nations that have very strict gun laws there are a lot less criminals obtaining and using guns to commit crimes. How does your theory explain that?	I've been saying this for years...Criminals have always had guns ban or notThat is the exact point of this thread... guns bans/control doesn't stop the criminals, endangering the populace.If you want to argue anti-gun... don't support the side of us "redneck-hillbilly-gunnuts" that you think are so stupid.
0	so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?	Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.
1	Not nearly as tired as the "YOU can't live like that because it is against MY religion" argument. Hell, that one pre-dates Christianity!	The tired old 'you can't eat seafood' argument attempting to try to justify illicit gay sex sin.
1	hey i just aked a question ....... you think im evil , how would your mum have felt reading half the shit that comes out of your mouth. pfht fuck you darling. oh and i love you.	how can you tell a man that about his mum??!!!
0	I have noticed he seems content to drop a Ad Hominem neglecting to actually argue.	TQ doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that I don't.
1	That's what's known around here as a lie, and I wish you were capable of feeling ashamed of yourself.	See my previous posts on this.
0	Out-and-out lie. There's really no other way to put this.	How, despite centuries of artificial breeding and decades of experiments, no one has ever observed one species turn into another ("speciation")
1	I'm not going anywhere with this thread. I just wanted to point out the obvious hypocrisy of everything your side represents, and nothing more. You all go right ahead and massage your shallow World views.	Certainly not from biblical accounts emoticonXDonno But I am not about to turn this thread into an platform for where you are trying to go.
1	so you want to try it as a demonstration? i thought not. claims are easy to make but you have produced no evidence but words and only fiction to present.  yep, it is almost there per 100,000. meanwhile, your nation is rising by leaps and bounds and innocent people are being convicted to protect criminals. even dan rather commented on u.k. crime being much worse than any place in america. there is a reason for that....	like i said that's why criminals would have more motivation to shoot an armed citizen.
0	Actually, I don't ask how the idea occurred. As I mentioned, Darwin suggested it. I'm not sure what the rese of that paragraph means.	2) Then u might ask, how did the idea of ape becoming human occured?
0	I think the FSM threw these guys a bone. They cherrypicked which taxa would give them the most statistically significant results. If they were to expand the method to include more and more taxa, they'd see the Noodly Appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Ramen.	“We thought that the idea itself was important, that this is a really powerful approach to a very major question,” said Funk, “but we thought there was no way in the world that we were actually going to get statistically significant results.” The reason for his doubt was the incompleteness and lack of uniformity of ecological data.
0	And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?	It destroys NATO's higher death rate "argument", and proves my point.California = "toughest gun laws" = 9.8 gun deaths per 100,000 population.Florida = lax gun laws = 11.1 gun deaths per 100,000 population.emoticonXRolleyes
1	So now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?   I expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? Am I to believe that you are a soldier there now?   Your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. I posted exactly what I meant to and you went off on a tangent. I asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if "show me yours before I show mine?" Pitiful.	If you had a rational thought on the subject, I would respond to this statement, but I won't even dignify your ramblings with a second thought.
0	Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.	No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns.
0	Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment, and how much gun control is legally allowed. Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.I see absolutely no comparison between the two.	In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with.

0	JFriday:In fairness, no one, pro or ant-gun can ever use UK stats to support thier argument again. Back in Jan '03 the UK government finally came clean and announced that they had been seriously fu**ing with crime statistics.You can make the argument that the UK state had something to hide with guncontrol and you would probably be right. Reliable information from UK ministries should now be accepted as less than credible.	You are really going to hurt for that statement.WHERE ARE YOUR STATS BACKING THAT UP?!?!?!
0	that's just darling, and all. but it still doesn't indicate that a fetus is a small person. no one denies it's alive. no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens. no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person, which is the simplistic point of that cloying article. it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate. i don't think it can ever be definitively determined.  using dr. seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument, however. i am not sure why you quoted shooter's post about a death sentence. however, if you really equate abortion with murder, are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder?	a person is a person no matter how small.
0	Really? The transcript shows that he did not ask her anything in the Gay marriage section of the discussion.Transcript can be found here: http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/pr...al-debate.htmland here: http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/...ipt/index.html (click on the same-sex benefits section and the transcript shows up right next to the video)	The difference that is being pointed out in the article you quoted is this: Biden DID clearly say he believed gay couples should have equal rights when it came to things like hospital visitation, insurance, etc.
1	What a relief, I would hate to think Batman was so gullible. But Dems, I can understand them thinking that. emoticonXHoho	It was sarcasm...seeing that's what some Dems think should be done.
0	heh. i'm amused that we both put 'massage' in quotes.	according to the news he admitted to getting meth from the guy and getting a 'massage' from the guy.
0	Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.	(if anything it says life starts at birth with the first breath)
1	Over the Internet that can be a particularly difficult call...	What's the difference between humans and chimps?
0	So, IOW, you are saying that those of us who are intelligent enough to realize that your non existent imaginary god doesn't exist have a chemical imbalance? Wow, that's quite a stretch even for you Archie baby.	And the same question about being angry at an allegedly non existent God applies to you too.
0	So do you want to argue my points or do you want to argue me? Which of my bullits are wrong? Which of them are right?	I suppose we could find a way to blame all the world's problems on gun-control.
1	Yes, that was one of Galileo's more absurd leaps of logic.	They compare programs like Eddie Eagle, to the dictator Kim Jong Il.
0	This is simply false. Rock can be folded under pressure. This has been proven by lab experiment. However there are many features in sedimentary rocks that cannot be formed quickly, for example, fossil trackways.	* There is abundant evidence that many of the rock strata were laid down quickly, one after the other, without significant time breaks between them.
1	Oh, now you've got Obama leaving a mess in your hole, and James Carville blasting your hole (Spicy Cajunspunk)?Now Bubba's not so sure about wanting to plug/plough your hole. Boy you really do get around, EZ. That hole must be pretty wide and loose.	It's not MY hole, it's Obama's mess.
0	Well then there's grounds for a lawsuit. Find a group of veterans and get them to sue the VA, funded by the NRA, and take the whole organization to court on charges of violating federal standards.	The VA is a law unto themselves as anyone who has delt with them finds out.
0	Ludacris and many others in the hip hop scene disrespect women with their lyrics and videos. Much of what hip hop puts out contributes to unwanted pregnancies.	Verse 3 goes of the song, I noticed goes:"Little Erica is eleven years oldShe's steady trying to figure why the world is so coldSo she pops x to get rid of all the pain'Cause she's having sex with a boy who's sixteenEmotions run deep and she thinks she's in loveSo there's no protection he's using no gloveNever thinking 'bout the consequences of her actionsLiving for today and not tomorrow's satisfactionThe days go by and her belly gets bigThe father bails out he ain't ready for a kidKnowing her mama will XXXX it all outta proportionPlus she lives poor so no money for abortionErica is stuck up in the world on her ownForced to think that hell is a place called homeNothing else to do but get her clothes and packShe say she's about to run away and never come back.
0	I believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions. So why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response?	Some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed.
0	So ban guns? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head. Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately. Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database. I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime.	In these transactions, the purchaser is not required to pass a background check so how can the seller be sure whether or not the buyer has a criminal history?
0	sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well.	humans are sexual beings, they have sex (something some posters may understand some day if he ever have sex) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precautions.
0	Making up numbers again georged? Care to post some links to this data?In 2005 Israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. As for the 28 billion in 2002...I know that is wrong. I recall a 200 million dollar thing, but I don't know if it went through.The rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so.	Pull those numbers from their primarily transactional GDP and problems would quickly appear cumulating with that spiral effect.
1	Only in the mind of a secular humanist atheist would it make sense. emoticonXGood	Wow, let's see what happens when we change a single word:Now there, doen't that make so much more sense?
0	And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the "genuineness" of ~2000 year old manuscripts...	Isn't it amazing how quickly creationists will accept natural selection and superfast evolution when it supports they're beliefs?
0	i agree. hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money, with the size of government, with foreign relations, with underage pages, with the military in general, with privacy, civil rights or even the most basic function of congress: oversight.  liberalism needs to be evicted from congress, therefore the republicans need to go.  it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans. democrats more conservative then republicans? well..given how far republicans have gone over i can't say i'm surprised.	the fact that america needs a republican congress is evidenced by the past records of the two major parties.
1	wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. finally you are cheering for the correct side. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again. it is funny how many of you religious people are so sure of your faith, but can't stand to see other people talk about how observable data doesn't fit with it.	personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again.
0	Except in the Dred Scott case the court wasn't trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right, or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery.	By your logic, when the Supreme Court ruled that African Americans were not citizens and that they were not entitled to protection by the Constitution in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) people should have just shut up and moved on.
0	I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated.	2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth.
1	is this the pro-sodomite woman talking here? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be?  where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. one more time now, preppy: where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. so go preach that trash to someone who's buying it.	i actually feel sorry for him and pity him he can not see jesus in another human being and is so addicted to the bible, and the teachings of the false god paul, that he and his kind have made it their god.
1	Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't "really" a christian.	Once again, my point was that evolutionists contradict each other.
1	well geeze pyg...i knew you were a bit itchy but i didn't know you hated gay people! i also didn't know you owned the 'internetz!' you must be related to al gore...how much did he soak you for his invention, lol? i don't know if you realized it but i'm gay too. yes indeedy little pyggy, shall i go back from whence i came or am i safe here with you? you seem to know what a 'rick roll' is so i'm impressed...'cause i've never heard the term.	god, i thought it was gay when youtube did it, but now obama... what's next, osama sends a rick roll to iran?
1	but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing. doesn't it. so you think that just because you enter a debate half-way, you can still give an uninformed opinion? weren't you the one ready to laugh at me? i won't laugh at you. i am only saddened by your personal attacks. yes, repeating yourself. i know what they say, you know what they say. i don't agree with them, on these points. answers in genesis are 'right' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being 'selective' in the information we use; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes. i disagree with them. do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution? i bet you've been very selective here too!	i see you still think my goal in life is to go back and read every post you ever made.
1	Just because you fail to realize what the article says doesn't make what you said true. Since you seem to like logical fallacies can you reconginze which one you just committed?	I really hate having to beat a dead horse more the once.
1	You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?	Did your thought process ever include the question: What choice does the "victim" have?
1	No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure.	Isn't that 'cells producing something other than what they are'?
1	And once again (s)he rambles on while responding to nothing said in the prior post. At least you're consistent in your irrational hate speech. BTW, the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all. Except in the mind of paranoid hate mongers, that is. emoticonXGood	Religion / christianity is negated by the very FACT it is violent and indeed "lunatic"!
1	oh yeah, that's right.... i forgot ;) i'm getting dementia already ;) well, i guess that if i don't make it to heaven (due to all the liberals i've tormented over the years) i'll be so busy shaking hands with all of my friends that i wont have time to worry ;)	if you believe in heaven, would you not think that the being who created heaven would have planned for the number of people who will be there?
1	So everything that other people say on a website or in a book is just and opinion? And everything you say is a fact? Nice how you've got things set up.	but indeed they are just other peoples opinions.Show me the documented proof!
1	And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?	Just when you are ready to come get my guns...... remember!
1	No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off.	Come to that... given that all humans start out as a single cell, that's definitely false.
1	Waxy, don't you have better things to do than cruise gay threads. ;)	Did you miss this part of my post?Waxy
1	Right on! The Obama administration is a colossal financial disaster. If he doesn't have another trillion dollars to XXXX he can't do anything. Tax and spend - that's all those liberal turkeys know how to do.	You're right, how silly of me to think that Democrats or this buffoon of a President would have anything to do with a BUDGET PLAN or even present a comprehensive budget; they have failed to do so now since 2008.Another illustration of the massive failure of leadership the Democrat Party and this President represent.
1	So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?  The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.  It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.	toxic gases, giant ash clouds, thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there's anything approaching an eruption, it's not a pretty picture.
1	Did you go to college, Trebor? You might want to look up how "pedophilia" is spelled. LOL!! Then you can go have a beer with Orion and watch his head swivel.	I can well believe Orion saying that you used a source that said the Rabbi's condoned pedaphilia, and denied the holocaust.
0	I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.

0	mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?	or have i got the wrong end of the stick and you think that we are discovering things closer to the truth and the stories are just a primative culture trying to work out how the world is as it is.
1	but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm...	i think if there is a god and it's anything like i picture, you'll be fine.
1	Wow, you are high on Christ...Scary...I haven't seen this addiction up close emoticonXRolleyes	For your info, and as I stated before, this world will not last much longer in its current state.
1	let's say that the law, based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data, decides that some folks are inferior to other folks, and thus less of a person? you know, if the law said 'because you are black, you are less of a person than shomeone who is white. you shouldn't be upset though, all scientific data suggests that you, because you are black, are truly inferior to those who are white.' would you think, because the law said so, that a black person was in fact a non-person?	the law can treat the late term fetus as a person because it has developed to the point where sentience is verifiable.
1	They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world.	I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature.
0	No it doesn't. That's why Darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory. Those who don't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand. Fittness is not a reference to big and strong. It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.I'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.You've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong.	Of those that are beneficial, the chance of actually being passed on is minimal considering the animal bearing that mutation has to actually be the biggest strongest animal to pass on its genes - unless it is lucky.
1	lol bias dysfunctions. i'm surprised you know such a long word. pity you don't know what it means. i can't blame you... being a retarded ignorant white woman. you don't even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs. go back to cleaning the house. worse is that you don't work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but don't pay taxes. you're better how?	pity you have not figured me out beyond your own bias dysfunctions , then you would hear the tone in my voice for what it is when i type it.
1	Oh, sorry, I didn't think that was a serious answer. Thanks.	How about a slap on the wrist and a suspended three day jail term?
1	And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....	Must simply be a matter of time...Honestly, Those arguments are totaly worthless.Compare the rate of criminality and murders in US and those of the average contries with gun-bans.
1	what? don't they have boyfriends? i'm just amazed that they don't design all women shirts so that they come off easy. hell, they invented the easy access bra ;)	who didn't know they needed certain shirts that come of easy...
1	oh yeah, you got me. bigotry and hate are major turn on for me. you could use a good lay anyway. muah. ;0	when i took a break from cd and came back you are so happy that you message me like 5 times begging for me to let you be my ally i still have them but i am not going to copy and paste them here because you will cry like you did with hellno.
1	yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!	no one knows anything about the constitution so how do they make claims that abortion is constitutional?
0	Apples and oranges. We're not demanding that they have abortions either.	Slave owners weren't demanding people own slave, simply that they had the option.
1	were it so simple. for the agents to 'freely assemble' among us they, or their superiors, must conclude that we are some sort of threat. would that make you feel loved? on a side note, i'm always surprised at how 'conservatives', normally so worried about government waste, take such a waste of taxpayer dollars so glibly. fbi investigating kiss-ins? joining subversive 'terrorist' xxxx biker groups?	if they're just hanging around amongst the minions, that's perfectly legal and not spying.
0	my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.	Here is an article on it:http://www.news-miner.com/Stories/0,...993580,00.htmlThe decisive moment seemed to be during the later arguments on the bill.
0	i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager.	the thoughtful atheist, full of skepticism but fearful of the possibility of the existence of god and a day of judgement, may wish to consider the prayer of the skeptic, as follows: o lord--if there is a lord, save my soul--if i have a soul.
1	i'm shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic.	a large amount of people disagree with you and you act 'shocked' at how that could be possible?
1	That is an interesting fact, how come I have never heard such a thing..maybe a link is in order and not a stormfront or the like link please....actually I have listened to gangsta rap...Easy E, Snoop, NWA, and so many others, in fact they are in my truck right now.. imagine a redhead "whitey" takes enjoyment in listening to all kinds of music.. hmm I also have Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Nat King Cole, and while we are at it I have music that I adore from Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Turkey and so many I cant list them all... whats your point?I would hardly call rap the decay of the 90's, apparently a lot of people listen if they are making money....I wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past? Maybe that would explain a lot.	What i really find disturbing is why you choose to ignore truths and facts....did you know that the blacks that were brought here from Africa were the criminal and the mentally deranged?
1	You mean the Conservative tilting Supremes donot know the law ? You want to tell them that ? emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken	How else can you explain some of the more recent controversial decisions.

1	I'm actually in the Detroit Subs with one kid in a Blue Ribbon High School and two in college nearby. And yes, the mayor's got the bling goin on in his wife's city-leased Escalade. I'm not sure if it has "dubs" on it or not, though, but I bet the stereo's kickin'. :)	Not the best school system there although the Mayor has a nice car I hear emoticonXClown

1	From the Catholic Educators Resource Center...Yeah...I am sure there would be no myths in there...sure you're right. emoticonXRolleyes	But there are good histories, written in the last twenty years, that lay much of it out.
1	On the bright side, it appears that the Rapture will solve the Social Security financing problem...	Err, no correction necessary, I just felt like saying Enrapture.No the dooms-day will not be on the arrival of the asteroid, that has nothing to do with it, the dooms-day event will be a terrible event, even for the innocents, wrong on both accounts.
0	No, neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. Legality and morality are completely separate things.	Are you suggesting that legal makes moral?
0	Logically incorrect. One can as many red balls as one likes, and still only have one green one.	If it's all that endless and limitless, there would have to be an endless, limitless number of planets exactly like this one.
0	Yet it is the only source I've seen that counted the incedents in which a gun was used in self-defence, but nobody was injured. I could assume that all of your sources and Ians only count occasions where one was injured. According to the source, they'd 91.7% of all times where a gun was used in self-defence.	But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves.
0	But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins.	We need to teach kids how to think, and unfortunately, ID doesn't seem to deal with thinking.
1	Proof for a non-event? What century did your purported non-event supposedly occur, Einstein?	And yet you spiritually challenged turkeys still can't provide proof that there is no resurrected Krishna.
1	you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright. 'sickening' is a good way to put it.	yet organized religion forces it's followers to do just that, to not question authority, pooh-pooh science, and never think for themselves let alone following their hearts.
0	See above. A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence. Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked, rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in.	As said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place, so their effectiveness is highly questionable.
0	I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification.	No, it is you young padawan learner... that has been mislead, some of the most famous and noted Darwinian Naturalists such as Crick, Huxley, Lipson... and others have admitted to their own discredit that the entire theory of evolutions rests on chance, here... but here, lets burst that bubble for you a bit more:
1	No. What the doctor was doing was going to church. He was not a monster. He was not a "sicko." He was a murder victim.   What his murderer did was murder.	It wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.
1	Not the same thing at all! Most gay pride floats are moade of crate paper and glue guns. Not gold. I think you have stratched this one really far. Nice try, thanks for playing. Try again soon! Wow, nicotine cravings make me a mean person!	I'm sure all the money for decorations, supplies, and city services for gay pride parades down through the years would go a long ways toward it too--what's your point?
0	So have I, since I know that evolution has and does take place. But I catch it from both sides because I don't believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness.	I have actually been called a heathen because I believe in evolution.
1	never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming.	you totallly made up that there was some 'other speech' pushing a 'socialist agenda.'
0	Why do you oppose gay marriage? The traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride. The wedding is what is sacred. What you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well. You have no valid reason to oppose it either.	If someone is opposed to gay marriage and does not dislike gays or fear them, just not wanting to extend marriage to gays they would not be a homophobe.One can be opposed to gay marriage and not intensely dislike gays or fear them.
1	but do you ever question it for your self? or are you content to just show up .. and let someone else tell you what it all means. the rcc has made , by their own admission, mistakes in the past are you suggesting that it won't happen again? are you suggesting they never made a mistake in their interpitation of the bible? if so you might want to tell that to gallileo remember him ? he was burned at the stake for telling the rcc that the earth went around the sun!	the rcc has priests and i follow its teaching as set down by jesus christ through his first pope his disciple peter.............
0	Right. They can never show how the belief in their deity is not a textbook case of the special pleading fallacy. (Pretty funny after all the hubbub earlier about double standards...)	Let's see you show that the God that you believe in is that God.. and that this God even exists outside the imaginations of the mind?
1	So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?	If you have no interest, then why on earth are you even here to debate?Besides this, you're trying to put killing human beings on the same platform as animals or organic plant life.
1	oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?	however, i do not place confidence in scientists.
1	How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?	Monkeys don't generally have problems with their private parts being functional.
1	So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?	It's also a natural, orderly process that plays out possible variations on a theme, making the organism not inherently stupid and clueless, but more like a creative artist.
1	So you advocate religion not because it is the truth, but instead because it gives you comfort and security? The opiate of the masses eh?	How sad it would be for me if I believed that this is all there is.........When you die there is nothing else.........I truly believe that a lot of atheists find religion on their deathbed...........At least I hope that is the case............
0	I think you are entirely correct. From the page VOR linked:	I think it's nonsense interpretation developed by people who were afraid that if they fought for guns as valiantly as they did for free speech, they wouldn't receive any donations.
0	Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, "the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God," and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God?	It's a false dichotomy that some critics of religion have cast religion in by saying that submitting to spiritual authority and thinking/reasoning are going to be juxtaposed.
0	i just love how you call it a baby and not 'contents of the uterus' or 'product of conception' or 'fetus'. the truth is, that was a child.	steve, nobody was saying that you have to give 100% of yourself to your cause or otherwise you don't really believe in it.
0	I think you need to answer the same question I asked the other guy, who is God?	Or maybe it really was god that envolved from the apes.
1	Oh . . . please be gentle with me. Whew! :p	I'll be gentle with you and assume that you simply misinterpreted my statement.
0	Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under "evolution" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose "science" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea.	plus there are so many other sciences that are lumped with evolution,
1	Alexander, I don't give a rat's rectum about King James. emoticonXBanghead	I've lost track of what we're arguing about here.Are we arguing about Alexander or James I?Are we arguing about whether they were bisexual or homosexual, either one of those two or both of them, or which one?
1	Poor little poopie.   If your gay sex agenda wasn't of the devil himself you might be better received in the world.	Good way to prove exactly what I am talking about christianists and these dominionists in particular want to oppress gay people.
0	Your partner wouldn't happen to be a guy, would he? As for your Christian friend, ask her to join the fray. I'd like to ask her a few questions, such as:Who do you say Jesus Christ is? If not Lord, God, Savior, and Jewish Messiah then she is on the wrong page.Ask her if people need Jesus Christ for redemption for their sins?Ask her if people should repent of their sins and turn from them?Ask her who the Holy Spirit is? If not God, then she's on the wrong page (note Acts 5).Ask her if the Bible doesn't say gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.)? Those will do for starters.	She is a christian but she doen't share your beliefs.
0	ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out.	i don't think the mechanisms are in place in our justice system to have a trial for the dead, so we can only look at the evidence in the cases that people have privately pursued.
0	Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.	as i have told mathew s on numerous occasions, you are free to put forth an initative, in your state, to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages.
0	So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?	You could put it in the form of a resolution, in the debate challanges forum.
1	spoken like someone truly out of touch with reality. how long has it been since you were in high school? because if it hadn't been so long you'd know that short of coming to school in a banana suit (maybe not even then), kids could give two sh*ts about what other kids are wearing.	they eliminate the need for competition between the pupils to come to school with the most expensive ' cool' clothingthus reducing the strain on the parents' pockets.
1	maybe he'll unban himself on the third day (or was that three days and three nights...)	).Remember when Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross, and all kinds of people said things like, "He who saved others, come down off the cross and save yourself, so that we might believe" (that's a paraphrase).
0	now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is.	and lest you make a foolish claim, allow me to point out that the fact that you personally don't like how something is changing does not mean that's it's been harmed.
1	i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented.	only 15.1%... so that means that 276 men (51 senate/ 225 congress) will be needed just to pass a law that has to do with a women's body...and if its something that could be bad for a woman and/or unfairly good for a man then they can get no where near the amount of senators/representatives needed to supress it.... [66.6666-15.1 = 51.56666--(535/100)(51.56666)=276]  (http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/of...rs/cawpfs.html)
1	i love how you are pro-choice until its a choice you don't like. let people carry guns in their own home. let them carry it on their person. it has nothing to do with you does it not? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy.	nevermind my observation that left to your own devices, days go by where you either follow up your own posts or pat each other on the back as you regurtitate canned anti-gun control rhetoric.

1	And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am. However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice. Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment.	I didn't have to CHOOSE to be heterosexual.
0	I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it.	Factor in the explicitly advertised intentions of the I.D movement and related sites such as AIG, and it's not hard to pick a winner.

1	No need for further evidence why this law would be dangerous to those who do not think exactly like you do!

I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever.

0	we do......most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time. For example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other "ancient" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand. Of course evolutionists will come back and claim "erosion" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called "Hidden Archeology" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the "wrong" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false.	If Literal Creationism is indeed true, why do we not find strata with species from all eras mixed together?
0	So? In your religion's view, everyone sins. Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours.	Leviticus 18:22 "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."

Not to mention that it proved the unintelligence of creationists (as well as their predictive abilities, which, I must say are very poor).	Like juveniles, you are so easily impressed.
1	Plenty. You haven't noticed how many "sentences" you post that aren't sentences?	How many of us do you know who type in broken English?
0	That interpretation is fine except that God says, "I WILL make a helper suitable for him." He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.	Okay, here is how it went: God made the animals.
1	Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.	The book "Icons of Evolution" details the original experiment and the resultant controversy over the fraudulant findings.
0	how many animals do you think were on the Ark? how many species existed at the time?      the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23	Thought I'd start a new thread dedicated to this myth..
0	yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected.	after all, if what you claim is true, human beings have no choice but to 'devolve.'

0	i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught.	considering that there's little new information and reasoning in any of these debates, i find it surprising that they keep coming up.

0	Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.	how is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ?
0	No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance.	Meaning, I take it, pure chance, accident, or just plain 'luck'.
0	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.	then surely you can't explain away why enzyme a and co-enzyme b are separate compounds but work together to produce another by-product.

0	ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?	the independence of the church of england may have started with henry, but anglicanism is more correctly dated from elizabeth.

1	Oh, oh, and don't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment's text, which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions, in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state.

0	Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that "UK will be Islamic", "Sharia Law for UK" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly "taking over" )."muslims are taking over the world" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!

1	I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state.	It deals with the death penalty...really the court is one vote away from getting rid of it because some liberal judges don't like it.
0	No, we shouldn't abolish every flawed system. However, when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death, it is not worth the risk.In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois, there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death. I think that constitutes a serious problem.	Does that mean that we should abolish every system?
0	persecution on political grounds? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here. he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption (bribing politicians) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin. now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government...and he lays all this out to a british newspaper.  political persecution if he returns? probably not. execution for treason? that one seems more likely.  in the extradition rhetoric arena, the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british.	the british refusal to return boris berezovsky to russia, is because he has been granted refugee status on the grounds that he has good reasons to fear persecution on political grounds in his home state.
0	Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!

0	Yeah, see this is the old "gateway drug" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a "gateway" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something "harder"? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.	AND THEN, you get to the marijuana addict that decides to try crack because all drug addicts hang together and so someone will try to get you to try new stuff.
0	what? i assume one is within one rights to be anti-gun. that's all.	because you supposedly have no use for guns, you think you can assume that it's not a dark history.
0	there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic).	by saying he still had support i assumed you meant you thought it was somehow shifting to the democrats... my mistaken assumption.

0	Religious faith, by definition, is a "jump in the dark" and there is really little(if any) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and ScientificMaterialism can meet. In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there isnothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science. Butsomeone who has, so to speak, already jumped into the dark cannot see this.The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law, morality, social conventions,aesthetic sensibility and such like.	You cannot begin to hold a rational debate about the unknowable.
0	That is true but that is the procedure.........Do you deny it?	Y'know, if a pro-choice person had posted a similar item from a pro-choice website, you would have dismissed it out of hand.
0	I think you might want to check your logic here... As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit. As you are, I am not terribly fond of policing someone's personal habits, but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries, assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored. This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem.	If drugs were more accessable we would likly have far less crime and far more drug adicts.

0	i love how you broke that down, but why would anyone who feels content in their life, by into something that's telling them they are wrong? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one.	in order to sell religion they convince people that they need it by telling them they are going to hell if they don't buy into their religion.
1	i'm surprised he didn't google it. maybe that's too logical?	he couldn't be expected to know that, since the american method of teaching geography is war, and they haven't invaded them yet.
0	it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about. do you mean 'having faith' in actual things? if so, then most definately. although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place, it can also be a fantastic one, and seeing that (as i'm an athiest) gives me some kind of 'faith' in the human capacity, society, etc (where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god).	i find that atheists often (not always) lack the ability to trust, making it difficult to have faith, even if it is just to have faith in the human capacity to redeem itself once is a while.
1	So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?	Are you suggesting that abortion is a judgment of God?

0	The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section.	One trespasses when he's not in his rightful place, but a baby developing in the womb belongs there.
0	All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past.

1	i must admit i was a bit confused when you came out with this: where in this discussion did i offer any solution to zimmerman (i don't remember mentioning him at all)? nor did i give any suggestion as to what i would do. so where did this 'both of you' come from? please could you also point out where i interjected pepper spray into the debate? a quote would be nice. oh, and the term 'enemy combatants' was just made up so that the bush and his partners in crime could get round international law. the geneva convention does cover them very clearly in the quote i gave.	troops are not issued pepper spray so it is a non issue which both you and jerry chose to interject into the debate.

0	daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation.	it is often 'taught' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally: indeed, a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed, and this requires a more direct and deliberate move: thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs.
1	Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?  Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.	so if that satisfies everyone's dues then this is done with.

1	You should use the same quote when whining about use of partial quotes, and not introduce different ones. Nozza made a false assertion and was refuted with his own words. You introduce a different false assertion and fail. Epically.	You should use the entire quote rather than cut to attempt to prove what you aare about.
0	Ever been to eastern KY? Many of the residents share a very strong faith in the christian religion. They also share abject poverty, malnutrition and starvation, substandard or absent medical care, contaminated water supplies, and dangerous and often poorly heated / ventilated "housing".

1	What part did your real daddy play in it? Will he be on the island, too?  This is a good example of a scant level of maturity. Your simple out for various arguments is to play the idiot/XXXXX card.

0	Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?	I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.
0	Because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people.	And I repeat my earlier observation: if DOMA is such a travesty, why not go ahead and try to repeal it as a Senator.

And regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria, are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon?
1	well if I don't get an answer here I'll just spread it around the whole internet. Fine with me.	Well, answering you seems to be a waste of time.You ignore/reject any attempts at explaining the things you clearly do not understand, and youlater bring up the exact same things that you have had explained to you as if the subject was never broached before.You are incorrigible and uneducable.
1	i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?	if you really believe that gays are oppressed then believe me you ain't seen nothing in the world as yet.
1	Nonsense. Just look at all the great things that the Dark Ages did for Europe!	This isn't to say that ethics should be disregarded in science, far from it, but if the US raises a generation of kids who think science is satanic then the possibilities for development are going to be slim.

If every pro-lifer was an adoptive parent I think they would have more credibility.

1	You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:  Question: Was Stalin a communist ?  Answer: That's what he said he was.  Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.	so stalin didn't actually practice communism (not that anyone has), but really just used bits and pieces to further his rule and such ideology is not communism but stalinism.

How would you like to be on the run or living in a hole for the rest of your natural days? That's the life that bin Laden lives today. He has to communicate to the outside world via courier and donkey. And tell me again, how bin Laden gains by killing Muslims? I don't quite get that part.	After all, the search has all but stopped for him and the US is being bled dry in a number of areas under Bush's leadership.
0	If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional, then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind.	Do you not understand what is currently going on?The ruling on whether the California state constitutional amendment was enacted "legally" was ruled on by the courts.What is discussed above is entirely separate.To say something brief to get you up to speed, our state constitution CANNOT violate the federal constitution.So if Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment, then Prop 8 loses.Whether or not Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment is the question that is currently being examined.

I think the real problem is that you just enjoy being belligerent and doing things like calling people "weasel" and "dishonest" when you yourself misrepresent like you did above.
1	I knew the mangling of Jesus's teachings would be forthcoming, and entertaining. emoticonXHoho   And of course lying about what I've said is just par for the course.

And if someone were concerned about what constituted torture, I doubt he'd pretend it wasn't a valid question, as you're doing.How do you know exactly what Jesus would approve and condemn???
0	But you are forgetting life-without-parole (and I do mean WITHOUT parole). With life without parole, there is also no recidivism.	I suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti DP stance.
0	They're going to say no? CA tried that. Tell me the last time utility costs were reduced by a state agency. It's a rubber stamp and nothing else. We travel in different investment circles. I don't know anyone putting their money in US long-term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40-year useful life situation. What's your take on the US economy in 5, 10 and 20+ years? Good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached? Enviros or not, if the return is there money always has its own way of doing things. Corporations are awash in cash. Liquidity has been the name of the game for some time, but there are always bridge buyers.	For example, we haven't built a new refinery in almost 30 years although people are using more gasoline than ever; a group in Arizona has been trying since 1999 to get the necessary permits for another refinery, but they haven't yet been successful.

0	Not many women would say they had an abortion now, let alone back when it was illegal.It is an emotionally trying event. I can understand why she wouldn't for that reason alone. Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence, or it could be a combination of the two.	It's kind of funny that they claim this happened, but can't get the woman to come out and say it?
1	Oh relax for cripes sakes. This is the "fun debates" forum if you didn't notice.	Those ads likely pay a large portion of the bill to be here...I pay nothing...I doubt you do either...I ignore the ads...I doubt you cannot train yourself to do the same.
0	Of course everyone has some basis for their views. Not even denying that. However there are ways that using that "basis" most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example. There are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. All I am asking here is that Archie, you, JP, etc. own that.	'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.
0	But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.	I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.
0	you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't.	all the laws in the world won't work, criminals will always be able to get guns.
0	Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.	"That may be true, but it isn't harmful so I doubt it really should be on the list."

0	Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing.

0	Yes because it is "officially" a life.Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life.If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option.	We can't force a woman to give birth if she doesn't want the child, but we can force the father to pay for the child's care regardless of whether he wanted the child or not?

0	For a 13 year old girl that could greatly damage her body to have a pregnancy so young. She is just starting to grow and mature, and its not healthy, natural, or right to have a pregnancy at that age. She could cause alot of damage being that young.	You make some great points but she could carry the baby to term and then put it up for adoption...........There are long lists of people wanting to adopt babies...........I know a couple that waited 5 years and then adopted a child from South Korea..........Why does the innocent baby have to forfeit its life?

0	Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.	And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A.

I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery.
1	And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.	Through the media's support of the presuppositions taught in high schools and under graduate institutions people all to often espouse their expertise in their knowledge of the certainty of evolutionary “theory” which is most always overwhelmingly lacking and incorrect.
0	i love how he says 'war of terror' not 'war on terror' and everyone claps. thanks for the clip, it's been awhile since i've seen that one. people don't realize but that unbridled rage and nationalism is what led to the rise of hitler and the holocaust as well as pretty much every genocide and war.

0	Homo habilis is the first species to use fire as a tool I think.	Tastyfish:Fire is well down the line after brain size has started to increaseWell I agree with that simply because humans have larger brains than chimps and fire is associated only with humans.
1	So if you are not naive then you must be evil	Any religion, group, person, or organization that believes, or preaches that homosexuality is less then heterosexuality is evil.
1	so if right now, i ask god for forgivness, someone kills me, i will go to heaven by default? makes sense to me, i mean, i dont have time to sin...	Everyone is a sinner...it's whether or not you ask God for FORGIVENESS and decide to CHANGE that gets you into heaven.
1	what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers, shotguns, and ieds? what's your p***ing away excuse for instances like these? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer. it's like a wolf in the chicken coop.	school shootings are linked to semi-automatic and automatic weapons as demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt by the tasmanian authorities where following the ban on such weapons school shootings fell to zero.
0	And that part of the decision (not allowing for the woman's health to be taken into account) is why I do not agree with nor do applaud this decision (in fact I am rather disgusted with it). If you'd like to see a more concise view from me, you can see the thread that Another_opinion started here: http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/9678-mothers-health-exception-where-do-we-draw-line.html	But as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and SCOTUS chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure.

1	Which ones? Ineffective how?   I'd guess the laws weren't struck down simply because too many people broke them.	because i'm sure there are some gun control laws that they're struck down due to their ineffectiveness.
0	And if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between? As they get closer, it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing. A principle comes in handy.	The whole point is that you can't use this warped version of the Razor for hypothesis testing.
0	You do realize that the rules are supposed to be absurd, to point up the absurdity of a recent court ruling, right?	ok.. lets get this straight..
0	third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking.	of what concern of yours is it that dono or anybody else for that matter was circumsized, circumsized their kids or believes in circumsism?
1	While I fully realize you can't do math and thus why you consider it atheism, but post #96 and post #81 are not the same post. But then again, you were the one who argued that post 113 came before 106 so maybe you do think that complete failure to understand math and linear thinking is sane?	He rants and rages against us while never making even the most basic degree of rational sense, yet to him it's us who is wrong.
0	Well, "reasonable" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?	And 'basically'.. banning firearms (as often proposed by many democRATS) is 'reasonable'?
0	when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore. 'fu** the poor' - mike moore. i put that together after a class in the mike moore school of movie editining 101.	did he change anybody's word to make it as if they said what they really didnt say?
0	well i was downplaying your argument because really, pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body. ITS NATURAL! OBESITY ISNT!	I am merely pointing that out.
0	i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site.	have to be careful not to over-complicate the page, but for once its sometimes difficult to tell whether a reply is in favor or opposition.
1	Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the "normal course of nature", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die. What about heart failure? Sorry, no paddles of life for you. We're going to let nature take its course. Just like your beloved pope, nature is not always right.	Cappy: How sad that you are unable to get this through your twisted brain.

1	It's a look....ad hominem all you got? Evidently. Where's your picture at so we can make fun of you? What's the matter? A vasectomy got you shooting blanks? And by the way, if one of your cronies "outed" me, then he was no buddy of mine. Evidently, he is intimidated, also. You should hear how they talk about you at TPA. LOL.	One of your old buddies told me your moniker in other forums, aaronsongs.
1	So the BBC folks are frauds and liars? You really are an idiot aren't you? Piltdown Bird is a colorful way of saying it was a Piltdown like fraud.   National Geographic knew it was a fake and published the article anyway.  Of course you probably still believe in the original Piltdown don't you?  You probably believe the Nebraska Man and Haeckels speechless apes were real too.  There is an echo when you think isn't there?	are you so stupid that you do not understand what the quotes around 'piltdown' signify?
0	The biblical end has got to be near. This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people's lives.	The suspect, identified as a 41-year-old doctor with personal and professional problems, is in custody in Fujian province.The victims were reported to be mostly first-graders.
0	I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.	I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule, but at close, honest examination would find that they rarely do.
1	No I think YOU are the imbecile. And it's great to see you follow your buddy EZ and his ways.. I suppose you've been training with him for some time now.. You're almost identical twins .. give it a bit more time and we won't be able to tell you apart.	Xcaliber thinks you are an imbecile because you believe in God.He must think you are a delusional imbecile because you think you have a one to one with him.At least thats something we agree on emoticonXGood
1	I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too.	How do you help an abused young girl stay safe by making sure the abuser doesn't get reported?
0	This is my understanding as well. Interestingly, concepts only approximate that which they intend to define. Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding.	We take reality and describe it in our minds and thus form it into abstract concepts which we can operate with.
1	tennis? you're joking right? it's already been proven that women can take on a man anytime in that game! others not so much but tennis most definately!	i say yes so that feminists and other women who think they're equal to men can see that they're actually not.
1	Oh but he is different in the mule's tiny mind. The Southern Baptist types are Christian and so uphold the mule's way of life, so it's alright for them to call for mass death.	He's no different from the Southern Baptist types who suggest nuking the middle east.
1	No, the law didn't specifically mention gays, or dwarfs, or one-eyed pirates, or 6 toed individuals. emoticonXRolleyes	The quote you mentioned in no way justifies allowing people to refuse to treat homosexuals while forcing them to treat all of those other protected groups.
0	Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding "cold")	But you will never come to agreement with everyone else in the world as to what makes something truly evil or good.

1	You forget, that all those nice rewards? None of them are rights.	Using your logic you may indicate that we should eliminate cars, food, heating/cooling systems, chairs, stairs, houses, apartments, work, money, paper, plastic, and basically everything that we have on earth because somewhere people are going to die because of almost everything.
1	First off, kudos on getting the quotes right! It's much appreciated.  Now, what's your actual assertion? If you spell it out than we can put this definition debate in context, and maybe actually get somewhere.	if all matter was information what would we need books or language for?
1	And yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children...	Another dimwitted white guy who lu-u-u-u-u-u-ves his guns.
1	Or possibly your Holy Fathe has resorted to XXXXX-bashing. It's all perspective. Frankly, I don't think that the views on this message board will fuel discrimination and hatred of Popes everywhere around the world, so I think they have less to answer for.	Well now my gay and liberal friends have resorted to Pope bashing........so very sad..........
1	How about other religious theories. What about teaching about the sun god? I don't mean that they believed that, but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe. Actually let's also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the Earth and other massive objects. We should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe.	Do you support the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public schools?Yes because it is the flipside to science and everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe.
0	a drink. a drink. one or two. and what the hell does abstinence have to do with this? everything in moderation, yeah yeah. all that fun stuff. i get it. i wasn't talking about light drinking. i guess i should clarify but i thought you'd catch what i meant.	you realize that weed being illegal is more harmful than good... and i dare you to get into a debate about that because i have so many facts in favor of ending prohibition it will make your head spin
1	and your kids go to private school yes? so you want higher teen pregnancy, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases?  if you are disagreeing with my statement that you want all of those lower, then you are admitting you either want them to increase or stay the same. as you have railed against abortion, it would appear you're being contradictory. make up your mind. and yet they have lower rates. funny how that works.  no. in the seven years since introduction 620,000 or so european women have used it. so that's around 88,000 abortions a year. 1.2 million happen in the us annually. as the population of europe is around the same as the us, it's not a valid point. 88k to 1.2 million is nothing.  plan b isn't abortion. try me.	do you have any children?
0	your argument is contradicting how can seeing people naked ifnringe on your personal thought and the other not? also the right isn't to marry whomever neterosexuals want. the limits apply to everyoen equally just people have different preferences.	if you could effectively prove that two homosexuals marrying each other would harm me physically or mentally, (and thus taking away my rights as a citizen), i would say you have a point.
0	That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb.	And in response to Zachvac i mean guns not arms (as in nukes) but im fine with automatics and such in the right hands.
1	So what do ya Say! Come On. Be reasonable! Do it for the children! Or don't we care about these children because they weren't hurt or killed by a firearm?	Downward trends, also being reported by other sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.CDC reports a significant decline in accidental firearms-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1994 and 2005.
1	Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.	It seems King Blue is the stereotype that pro-choice folks think of when they see a pro-life person.
0	Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?	Plus what did all of the insectivores eat for 40 days?
0	Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman.	Don't they get that the whole pro-choice movement is based in a desire to make sure that ever child is a wanted child?
1	Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it	A women by the name of Mary Anne Warren said this
1	i love when random myth followers talk about critical thinking :d	i see critical thinking isn't something you're particularly familiar with.
0	You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.	it dosnt simply say "see bible"everybody should have equal rights.
1	Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.	While things like this seem like small pro-life victories, they are really considerable and should encourage us pro-lifers that we are making a difference--getting back to a higher value of the unborn is our goal, and we must not let up.
1	Yes, but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper. Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that!	emoticonXFrazzled So .... you actually think the collapse of the Minnesota bridge is because of gay marriage???
1	So it's just fine if someone says "gay people are prone to force Christians out of their towns", eh? Interesting. emoticonXWowJust "typical English usage", after all ....	Some statements are obviously meant to demonstrate a common thread regarding a group action, but not to claim the ENTIRE group commits that action.
0	That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue.	Again, these are facts that the pro-life/Christian-Con movement you never find out about.
0	i love how hamas apologists require showing idf abuses to defend their actions. pathetic.	why don't you tell us about the terrorist activity that necessitated military activity that inevitably caused also civilian deaths.
0	You know that what you call "immoralism" is my life. Why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due? You don't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you. I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry.	Personally, I think U.S. conservatives have gotten too complacent these days--we need to protest like this more often.
1	Ah yes, adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others, to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy.	A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.
1	Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea! A lot of their mythology isn't original: it was stolen from other people who thought it up first.	Listen not to the lies of the Foodstuff demons, instead bow down to the Invisible Flying Space Monkeys, for they are the only path into heaven!
1	Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes   I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away.	If I haven't made you understand already, imagine a well-known media personality saying what I've just said to you, right out loud, to all the world, but off-the cuff and for no reason.
0	Well, that's your claim, anyway. Truth is that billions of theists accept evolutionary theory as is and reject the standard ID arguments.	All too often those opposed to Intelligent Design simply reject any notion of God no matter how unemotional and rationality based that notion is.
0	oh really?  science does not say 'we dont know x, y, z, but we want to know x, y, z, and so we observe x, y, z, and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true, or not? (it's a question..) if scientists were too busy learning what is, then the science that is present now, would be non existent, because in order for science to learn and understand, it must be too busy learning and understanding what 'might be', or what it has not known, yet.	scientists are too busy with learning more about what is, than what might be.
0	a lot of people are adopted... my science teacher was adopted. he had a successful military career that ended with him as a war planner helping to plan the gulf war... he had a successful chiropratic practice too. what you said is not so true. should he have been denied his life because of some emotional trama he might bave later in life? i don't think so.	some more innocent people will not be killed.
1	poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.	maybe you can look it up on the net.
0	hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill	i can name my own; germanic, and celt, slavic, and dinaric(italian-greek) are others as well.
0	Actually there is a better solution.   Mandatory male and female birth control pills, financial penalties if you stop taking. Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.	...to curtail abortions.Any woman who has an abortion for convenience only (not raped, no incest, no danger to the mother's life) shall have both ovaries removed.What do y'all think?
0	It is in the first place unclear to whom the "further harm" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different.	The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child.
0	oh yes i forgot to answer the key question: where does information come from. its a simple answer. from a local decrease in the degree of disorder. ie a reversal of local entropy. see adami for a development in mathematical and biological terms.	i don't care what the definition is...i can't even get you kooks to answer if information exists or not, even by your own defintion.
0	here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway.	like stem cell research, same-sex marriage and speaking in tongues?
0	The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary.	The dino would be to heavy to glide or fly with them if they weren't fully developed, and even then only a few yards could be gained when jumping off a hill, ect, and when not fully ready.
1	reckon if a rock could think it would have a concept or two.	you can say we are more conplex than a rock, but that does not make a difference; matter can not accout for concepts.
1	every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make.	well those 'slave owning white guys' (of which not all of them had slaves and most of them knew slavery needed to be ended) founded your country and established the government by which you feel protects your 'right to abortion' or 'personal autonomy'...eventhough they never established this....
1	Dude, you only figured that out now? I'm disappointed in you. just joking. Everything he states has a hidden agenda.	What was it they said about statistics?
1	wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights? well no duh but if i 'bucko' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i'm slightly different i'm not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality. and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay, accepted it and realized that other people aren't the end all and be all, that they'd eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn't the world maybe they'd still be alive.	if you can't answer, maybe you should deal with that.
1	In other words you would wait until we were attacked again before doing what is required. If we vacillate and wait for the nuclear cloud it will be too late. It amazes me; utterly amazes me, at how strongly felt the left believes in the good will of bin Laden and the terrorists to clean up their act. Just amazing. But with Bush? Noooooooo. He's ALWAYS wrong and never right. Isn't that about it?	I'd rather be correct and doing the right thing to make the world safer.
0	And science helped Stenger write his book. How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints?   another	Science helps those who seek to understand God in a more profound way, to learn about the intricate and complex unfolding of His creation.
0	I saw that...was that all they had to say on the issue? I was looking for how they died...was in the doctor that did it or what? Aside from that...what is your point? I don't understand how this related to Planned Parenthood misleading people.	do i need to go back and make it very big and bold so's you can see it?
0	So, because she's bigger, she can kill the fetus off? That is generally the idea the school yard bully has.	Phisically, she is larger and much more capable than the fetus,
0	There are in place control procedures for traveling with weapons. All he should be charged with, and I expect he will before this is tried in court is breaking the Airport procedures, or maybe they are FAA procedures which could imply Federal laws.   This guy should have contacted the Airport at check in to report each and every weapon he was traveling with. They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed. I must say that I'm somewhat alarmed at some of what is allowed if I put my terrorist thinking cap on. FAA News	It kinda seems suspicious like a primer colored Nissan Maxima with five guys wearing stocking caps sitting in a vacant lot at 3 a.m.........something's not right, but nothing is illegal.The guy should have been asked to leave airport property.Officer #1: "HOLY COW!
0	why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people.	sure, they've probably a hell of a lot of stories and anecdotes which would prove entertaining, but they're ... they're filmmakers, of all things!
0	the word of easy's god is evil! that explains a morally bankrupt lot.	evil is objectively identified in the word of god.
1	Except for, ya know, like the whole Old Testament.   False testament: archaeology refutes the Bible's claim to history	Never has it been shown to be fictional or false in any way so it has most assuredly stood the test of time yet your ilk continues to deny it can be the truth it has been shown to be with every new discovery.
0	emoticonXWowYou are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along.Asking "what they would need" is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place.A lot of "doesn't this look like ...", but that's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests. You see what you want to.	I think most scientists would admit the universe looks designed, so what would convince them that it actually is?
0	It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.	And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.
1	I can hear all the scores of laughter now. emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes   But alas, this is pointless, as are you. I'm bored and done.   ciao	Words like "high road" coming from your mouth is incredibly funny.Keep at it !!
1	According to Genesis? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence? How about Darwin's On the Origin of the Species?	Anyone who looks at this situation logically should realize that at sometime in the past there must have been a time when there was less genetic damage in the genome.
0	I did not say that violent crime "rarely" occurs, merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks. I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals.	Because being the victim of a violent crime happens enough times for it to be a genuine concern.

0	i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management.	you are indeed correct that uncontralable forest fires are hazardous for humans who live nearby (as well as property).

0	"True" is not a good use of language to describe opinion. With regard to his opinion, I think he makes some good points, so I don't really need to ask him if its true. You on the other hand do need to speak to Olsen as you are claiming his letter rubbishes the concept of evolution- an opinion I hazard he would very much disagree with.	Why don't you write Dr. Olsen and ask him if this is true?

1	lol...you read my whole post only to conclude with "what's your point." Evolutionist brilliance on display. I'm not mistaking nothing for nothing. I know my stuff. You obviously know nothing and don't care to learn it.	I'm not sure what your point is.
0	Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore.	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of.
1	Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....	So we're not in the mood to discuss future restrictions that won't be used either.

0	allright, well then i think it's odd too, arians would have made more sense. i'm surprised they are considered obscure, the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church, and the arian controvery was it's main event. for the record, they were discussed in my high school, that's why i was making sure.	there would be absolutely no reason at all to discuss a relatively unknown and ancient religious cult in a junior high level history book.

1	HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is.   6) And the standard "theistic evolution" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it.	Evolution and the rest of "big science" are just described as having an atheistic preference.

0	Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case.	If there's not, we investigate certainly and prosecute if the law allows.
0	i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea. (from the science point of view)all humans are traced to monkeys from africa. from there they spread throughout the world. if it is not evolution, then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs? how come africans have a darker skin tone? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair? i doubt it is coinsidental, and no offense, but i dont think that a god did this for us. every person has a subconscience. in this subconscience we think of lesser facts. does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better? i believe so.	i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of.
0	do they conver the same types of subject? i have, as yet, not heard much 'good' about american education (nor health), so it's interesting to hear about these things from the horse's mouth (so to speak).	most midwest colleges take act scores and most eastern schools want sat scores, so most kids i know take both.
1	It's not often you see such a golden opportunity handed to you on a silver platter.	You don't see me getting on here and saying "and you call yourself an atheist?"
1	ah yes....."Gaytheist," the terminal homosexual atheist liar at various forums such as IIDB and Tweb misrepresents me to some guy who studies tadpoles. The little XXXX liar atheist claimed to the author that I used his paper as "evidence" of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she couldn't back up when I pressed her on it. This was merely his response to her strawman lie. Funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is.

1	i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused.	if you have one, i would love to hear it.
0	I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. Until then I'll remain skeptical. Let's remember that Democrats and liberals hunt. Remove that group and what's left? Something less than 20% of Americans that own only handguns.	No I'm not suprised I wish I could put my hands on the pol on firearms ownership that put the % of dems that owned guns was around 46%.
1	And because this man said it, it must be true? A simple appeal to authority.	Robert Naeye, a writer for Astronomy magazine and an evolutionist, wrote that life on earth is the result of “a long sequence of improbable events [that] transpired in just the right way to bring forth our existence, as if we had won a million-dollar lottery a million times in a row.”
0	I think bringing "emotions" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to "non-belief" would be irrelevant (and irrational).	when such is the case, it is no different from a religion
1	We have a terrorist supporter among us, objecting to restrictions on terrorists! Why do you hate America?	Terrorist agents, who have access to missile launchers, grenades, grenade launchers, heavy machine guns, and anti-aircraft cannons, all of which come from all other nations in the world...are going through the hassle of coming to America, procuring forged documentation, and buying civilian legal firearms that no army in the world has ever adopted as their main battle weapons?Did you eat lead paint as a kid?

0	i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it.	this creed strains credulity to the utmost, and i suspect you'll find lots of christians who don't accept it literally.
1	Well are there 4 or are there none? What about the Archaeopteryx lineage, why do you keep avoiding the question by changing the subject? It's no wonder scientists get annoyed with creationists.	All you can show me are 4 "links".
1	So theistic evolution is not a belief, not a faith at all? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using God to fill gaps?	Conclusion from data and reason, not belief.
1	Worship me and I'll bless you too. With money of course. He can't even give you money. I am the true god and I created the mindset that he was a god in him. Worship me and spread the word about the true religion. Everyone who joins my church will instantly get $1,000 and after a week of membership you will get $1 million. The end of the week is when my project is and then you can go into the real world. All those who didn't believe in me will be destroyed when my world I created gets to the dump.

It was all created for us??  Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something.

0	And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay.	Even though I love them because they are my family, I would not support them if they were to marry.

1	Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not? Well, alledgedly, 23 innocent people have been put to death, and for sure two unrefutable cases. I don't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system.	what I am talking about is not a death penalty trial as we have today, but after the person has received a 100 year or more sentence.
1	the moon is made of cheese because i said so. was i persuasive? neither were you. do you have the capability to actually debate with facts? you saying something is true doesn't make it so. oh, and i'll save you the trouble.. i'm going to burn in hell, i'm, how does it go? spiritually challenged? and oh yeah, i'm going to bring about something called rapture or something like that. lol	you're right in step with satan, though, so you can really feel proud of that.

1	EZ. That is not what I said.I would think a Bible website would be good for biblical information, but for archaeological information? not so much.If you want to provide archaeological evidence of the Exodus, why don't you seek out information from an archaeology sources? Please answer this.If I wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings, I wouldn't seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource, I would seek an archaeology expert. Doesn't that make sense?	Shame on you for that bigotry.

0	in what passages does jesus refer to his junior partner? i'm not saying he did not, rather, i'm not recalling off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus.	the holy spirit is referred to repeatedly by jesus in the gospels, and the working of the spirit is a central theme in acts and paul's letters.
1	that i later 'concede' in a pm? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession.... what do you think a 'logical premise' is? show me denying that i said a. i'll be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. of course there is an objective truth here, i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable....	or maybe you just needed to redesign logic to go along with the redesigned universe you came up with when you first arrived?
0	simone darling, please stop. your making yourself look foolish. your trying to compare uniformed soldiers in an organized military under civilian gov't control to terrorists. there is no comparison to be made here, even you should be able to see that. huh? the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia.	the way he conducted himself, bush probably wanted to get totally out of afghanistan too.
0	how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!	i believe dametel is referring to leviticus 20:13 - 'if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.
1	i am impressed you are impressed by that backward-minded bigot who's main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said, 'fuck the fags'? come on dude.	yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.
0	yeah, that was all just exaggeration and absurdities from religionist to make the story more fantastic and supernatural. or else nobody will ever join them religion.	i just don't believe that a certain jesus came to this planet, born by a virgin, walked on water, died on a cross so people can enter heaven.
0	It is an acronym for 'Y'oung 'E'arth 'C'reationist. In other words... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God.	Am i stupid or something... whats a YEC?

0	The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow. Please give me one way those two things relate to each other.	THEY care about life more than the "free" world....I believe that one of the reasons we are dealing with terrorism in the world is because we are committing mass murder on babies in the womb...Need i say more...
1	'poor bill' ? yes poor poor bill, i really feel sorry for him for having the misfortune to meet monica . anybody who had the bad luck to meet monica deserves our compassion and pity. yes.... poor poor bill....so hillary was a saint and lord knows what monica was !	thats precisely the problem: saints are good for one thing only, hence monica.
1	Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?	Mayabe they were wise, but they didnt have all the knowledge on the topic of power or they would still be in controll today.
1	in that case its a single act of terroism so if you know all of this what's the name of his group? i wasn't on a high horse. also could you post the source saying he was part of some group and not just a loon.  jeez that sucks. *shrugs* well no different from black leaders who were targeted, slave owners/abolitionists who were targeted. this happens all the time. i'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. i love how its a conspiracy! *roll eyes* its terrorism not a conspiracy. unless you gonna tell me the governments in on it. xd	he did, and we do know why he did it.
1	What the heck did you have for breakfast today, huh? A bowl of nails and terpentine to wash it down? Talk about a foul mood. You've been to half a dozen threads just this morning launching personal attacks at everybody you come across, and most of them have something to do with 'I'm glad there aren't more people in the world like you,' or 'I hope you're the only ones the terrorists kill so we can get back to making this nation great,' blah blah blah. They invented things like Midol for moods like yours.Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them stupid, or misguided, or immoral, or dishonest, or any of the other snipes you've been firing off. Lol, and you're telling me to not throw any hissy fits.	Thank god there are not more people like you in the world/.
0	What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. MayThere is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations. I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3 One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:	These authors claim that for an entity to be regarded as a person, it must have developed at least incipiently exercisable cognitive capacities or abilities..... (Another view} distinguishes between a living human body and a living human person.
0	For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad. If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together.	But, what if, everything in the universe was originally "placed" pretty much where we see it now?
1	i lived next door to a dope dealer who was a murderer, am i dead ? no !	i find it offensive, not out of being a pedophile, but by being american, taught to respect other peoples rights.......and here we are 40 years after martin luther king.........still violating peoples rights successfully.
0	Dealt with. Wolves and dogs share a genus, not a species. Along with coyotes and jackels. See above for lots of transitionals, also.	I'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species.
0	now lets add one more wrench into the anti-gun works! when the american people read, 90% of weapons come from the u.s. they are led to think, bought in an american gun store.  something even sinjin apparently believes as well. however, doing some research, i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u.s. weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store. why? because they came from the u.s. government, dea and the cia. military grade weapons. now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u.s. weapons?    central america: the farc, the contras and the flow of weapons  america! get the picture now?	although it must be noted that some percentage of the weapons that were not traceable could well have come from north of the border as well.
1	You evidentally didn't grasp the apparently immense complexity and vagueness of my post.	Are you for or against a ban on smoking in public places?
0	i'm pretty sure you're joking... but still, if one has the power to acquire and manipulate knowledge sufficiently well, then one can learn to protect himself from bombs and such. my house was recently afflicted by ants. massive amounts of ants. yet their numbers did not amount to much after the strategic placement of a few of these.	the first time he eats a pizza with something good on it, has a beer or a little bit of grab-ass with a woman not wearing a beekeeper suit, muslims will commit to blowing up and/or beheading him, and by sheer number alone, they will succeed.
1	so atop a mountain of ignorance is where we will find religious people? yeah, sounds about right to me.	he has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.'
0	Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.	Heading further down that path...If the "right" belongs to the child, then the "right" obviously also DOES NOT belong to those opposed to gays.More specifically, the "right" to WAIVE potential parents as ineligible does not belong to those who are opposed to gays.The "right" would belong to the child to decide who HE/SHE wants, and it would be a bigger usurpment of this right of the child to DENY the child the option of gay parents than it is to present him with the option.
1	So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot.	Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.
0	Since they are issued by the military I would think so.	Are those weapons registered?
0	Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one.	if something happens to the people who are named on the website as a direct result of the website then i would say a great deal of justice is due and the burden of guilt is on the one who runs the website.
0	the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.	over the last generation or so, the dutch became quite good at rescuing hostages from the hijacked trains that became an annual event; the russians lost a number of hostages in a theater a few years ago when the gas they used proved a bit strong; and the filipinos became notorious for losing all hostages.
0	If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is "true"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator. References:* The Creationist Basis for Modern Science.* The Lie: Evolution ~ Ken Ham.* Evolution: Fact or Fiction? ~ John Blanchard.	You can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason.
0	if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep.	so really what was your point cause you haven't made one!!!
1	Ha. Those must be the same folks who believe in the missing link like you do.	I am surprised (well not really) that you don't see the simularity.And, we must not forget the Elvis believers too

1	Umm, don't know about you but I also eject waste through my penis - just don't do it when having sex, just not polite (unless they ask, now there's another fetish I don't get). Isn't it odd if the anus was not designed for a penis its still pleasurable?	In fact it is dangerous to shove things up there, such as a penis, especially when the body is trying to send waste out; this courses all manner of problems associated with digestion.
0	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.	In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'?
0	But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.	In that case, even if you want to put religion into the mix.
0	The guy can have an opinion but the ultimate choice is up to the woman who can listen to what the guy says or not, it's up to her. I believe that is what sinjin was saying.	I have known girls who have gotten pregnant and wanted an abortion but the fathers of the babies told them they didn't want them to have an abortion so the didn't and now the baby is healthy.
1	not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage. 'ex-gays' are supposedly straight, right? so they are already protected under existing legislation. if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans, and then insisted they should be known as 'ex-democrats', would we need another legal status for them? no.	i don't keep track of who is who, but whoever is pushing for hate crime laws that establish gays as a protected group with special legal rights.
0	Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word "proof" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story.	So I should not accept what you say without some degree of doubt.
1	That explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? ROTFLMAO	Nice work; I think that the reason those kids who own guns are more likely to get into trouble is a result of a specific political outlook that they are raised under which has an ifluence on their thinking.
0	I believe it's there, but I'm certainly no one to push that belief on anyone.	And all I was saying is that, despite Zechariah, I have yet to find anything supernatural in myself.
1	Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march.	think of it this way...you have 1 camera at the event...you hear about this 't-shirt' thing and all of a sudden the camera is not focusing on the kid tripping over himself to roll the egg but to gay parents wearing these t-shirts and them talking about how they are great parents.
0	Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.	It is a direct accusation by the CURATOR OF BIRDS for the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION against all the proponents of the dino bird story.
1	Are you blind? I was refering to Nancy Pelosi's "'fair' speech" policies, not free speech. Fair speech is an attempt to limit free speech.	Utter nonsense!It sounds like a bunch of bozos still haven't figured out what free speech is all about.
0	race is the elephant in the room of american politics. segregation is not official, but who can deny that de facto segregation does not exist in the usa? blacks stick to blacks and whites to whites. do you see any blacks in the tea party meetings? how many blacks voted for jon mccain in the last presidential elections?	did you know that jefferson was an advocate of racial segregation?
0	Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of "creation science" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion.	If there are many people reading this that already believe in evolution, or for that matter, believe in biblical creationism, then it is important to keep in mind that the people appealing to science have biases at work, regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves.
1	Hey, it's the same god, just older. The birth of his son mellowed him out, you know,.. made him think about the future more, and have to worry about responsibility and all that stuff.	Why does it keep referring back to the OT without mentioning that the god that is around today is a different one?
0	Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of "creation science" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science.	Wow a statement that is both honest and correct from a creationist!
1	I am not making a mockery of the second ammendment (and so what if I am. Isn't free speech on the first ammendment?). I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this. If I was mocking anything it was that you were dodging the question because you want to say no limits although in face of something so obvious you are embarrassed at such a statement.	You know the answer.
1	Fundies don't say do as I say, not as I do. We say do as God says, not as I do. There's a huge difference.	These are the ones who preach "do as I say, not as I do."

1	You don't mean Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, do you? The Russian spies? Nah, you said wrongfully accused.....	Or someone who was wrongfully accused doesn't get a chance to get out.
1	The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust.	You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.
1	as i said, for clarification, and no other reason. it's all drivel to me anyway, so i didn't see the problem in adding evolution onto theory. show where it said that if you would, and clarify your question. if you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life. i'm surprised you couldn't deduce that by just reading what it said. why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article? can't you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it?	some other questions i would like answered about your 'proof' would be: why is it assumed that the nuclear reaction taking place in the sun's core would be perfectly linear?
0	Really? Let me see. Two creation myths and a global flood myth where 5 million "kinds" of animal were crammed into a big box that magically floats for a year - yeah, that's secular history.	The claims made in the Bible can all be see in secular history.
0	I do appreciate your point while I disagree on principle. I guess it boils down to the fact that even if I believed in a God I couldn't accept that He would command us to suppress our true innate nature. Why would He makes us that way and then expect such a thing? Christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what God commands. To suppress a good many natural inclinations. To accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished, our nature brought to heel.	Of course I agree with you about sexuality, but that is a different issue.

0	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i think that it can because money has fixed all of my problems.  come on! give me an answer to what can't money fix? leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. i would feel however i was feeling before i died. in the debates hypothetical i wouldn't even know that i was going to die. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that? wow! there are many things? to back up your assertion, list 5 of these things for me.	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant.
0	and the other two...? 'political disorder and confusion' is not the same as personal 'disorder and confusion'.	as has been pointed out to you now more than once, the most that can be ascertained from the evidence is that it was possibly done in some places--perhaps in remote areas or areas that were not entirely in lockstep with rome (or constantinople early on).
1	WOW are we seeing the softer, gentiler Jyoshu?   Your snoopy avatar must be afecting you :) :p	Gay people are right when they say that things like divorce are a lot more prevalent of a problem; I think churches need to cool it some on the homosexuality thing and simply work on showing the love of Christ.
0	I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.	If they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare, and not just legal.
0	What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.	#3 - Can anyone explain to me why no other apes, monkeys or chimps have evolved into a higher species?

0	one idea per episode? there were always at least 4; one for each main character. and they always linked together perfectly. with the exception of a few episodes at the beginning and the last one, seinfeld was always gold.  the simpsons, on the other hand, has sucked for the last few years when they turned to the 'pick a celebrity guestspot' system.	the show 'seinfeld' was absolutely hilarious.
0	you're assuming a need to reduce it because government, or a special interest, requests it. if enough people want it reduced, their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it. deemed by whom? the government, or a special interest? who cares about the species? the majority of individuals, or the government, or a special interest? if the majority doesn't consider them problems, then no solutions are necessary.	ok, no one said that i would look to a large govt for anything.
1	Leave it to a leftist to cite a leftist forum for evidence that a leftist agenda is supported by dedicated leftists. Go figure, huh? This post just proves that attempting to reason with such an irrational thinker is truly a waste of time and effort.	You and your other handles that comprise this entire forum of one man who probably also needs to see a doctor for a strong psychiatric prescription.
0	Clinton gave access to b/c which is known to prevent pregnancies. Bush has reduced access to b/c (including e/c). A primary reason for aborting is money - Americans have been less well off under Bush.	Of course, we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time.
0	Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.	Are you telling me that arctic foxes at some point in history did not have this ability?

0	And for the record, i think anyone that tries to take away a women's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life, or has any concious about the woman at stake here. You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. I am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do.	Any other subjects on which you are delusional?probably....I think anyone who kills an unborn child with a knife to the head is a murderer.
0	HA wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints, muscels, heart, and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb? Obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet. Some of which can be detrimental.I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out.And im not really sure what a "pregnancy" is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant, i think of 2 people, not just 1.Also, the baby has its own blood, its own immune system, and contains its own calories once consumed. theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion. Just like you need food everyday.	Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental.

0	Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it.	He's a creationist for crying out loud.Their manta is "to lie, steal, cheat, and defraud anyone" to get their message across.
0	Brinks plays on people's fears to sell security systems that don't even work. Insurance companies play on people's fears to sell their policies.	The glorification of firearms in movies and video games is wrong and promotes irresponsible gun usage, but the gun industry's advertising propaganda, which exploits people's fear of criminals to sell guns, is perfectly responsible.
0	He was barred for presenting hard evidence against the Big Bang. Observable evidence. He was the head astronomer at Mt Carmel not just another astronomer. He was our best one.Being barred from the telescopes he was in charge of , being fired , and having to move to Germany is not what you consider suppression? I am not willing to discuss this with you anymore if you refuse to do it honestly. You can say anything.	Halton Arp is far from suppressed.Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.
0	well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?	when someone says 'there is no convincing evidence for x', you have to look at what biases they may have about x which might cause them to set their requirements for 'convincing' to be higher - or lower!
1	And you know what I think? I think that everyone who doesn't have sex 24 hours a day 7 days a week is denying human beings life every second. I'm sure some of those sperm would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you don't think they should live [/sarcasm]. Why don't you think this? Why embryos? Embryos are the one thing that have great potential to cause harm in a woman, and you just so happen to choose them as human beings. Very suspicious...	i would say that those people are glad to be alive and im sure some of those aborted babies would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you dont think they should live..

0	Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing.	For the most animals, the indicator for life is brain activity (Note: brain activity is one of the requirements of life, but it's not THE definition).
1	woohoohoo, diogenes, talk about twisting my statements, wow! wow! i am just plain flabbergasted!	it seems to me, in light of the number of recent child rape/murder cases committed by recidivists, that simone has it backwards and those folks who have no faith in our justice system would rather see ten innocents die rather than punish one guilty person.
1	You your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that? I suspect that you are talking out of your elbow since I haven't seen any evidence that you know what logic is. Mostly I see hysteria and superstition in your posts.	Your logic is remarkably lame to say the least.

0	ya know what? this has inspired me to make a thread, hold on a sec.	i don't think personal attacks are the route to take, but i may be too nice :p i would emphasize that while the fetus does have importance as a potential member of our society, when the woman becomes pregnant we have to deal with what it is.

1	i so love it when you have to work so hard to avoid any points i made. i take it as assent to my original post.	probably because you know you have a snowball's chance in hell of getting one.
0	True. Gallup couches the questions in a way that favors spiritualism. That is his preference and I think that his polls are slanted that way. I don't think I have ever seen a poll that actually asked the question directly and "no religion" doesn't really ask it. The numbers are just guesses. I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low.	The trouble with those poles is that peopel who 'have no religion' can be theists, and there are atheists that assocatite themselves to religions for social reasons.
1	You don't want anyone saying gay people are whacked, but you will make it your business to insult someones religion?! You are a hypocrite!! You say,"Don't judge gays!" But you are judging people by their religon?! I thought you were more mature then that. Hey you live ad learn.emoticonXRolleyes	Its like they knew that once these kids hit college they would a) get too horny, b) find reasons to question their faith.
0	darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class.	i have seen these debates and granted mine are not the best debates and may just be plain and simple retarded but my answers match the question.
0	Says who? People have the right to say anything they want to. There is NO right to not be judged by someone. It doesn't matter if something someone else does affects you and me or not. People can think whatever they want about other people. People can also SAY what they want. As far as a personal philosophy of behavior, I agree with you--what you're saying is a good rule to live by. But I can't agree people have no right to condemn or judge others.	In fact I have no right to suggest they even try if it doesn't impact me directly and negatively.
0	1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. i haven't watched tv in quite a few years, and when i did i didn't watch c span.  where are the facts that the court has cited? 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself. wouldn't i have to be in denial in the first place though?	2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself.
0	Oh it's no mistake Montalban. I, unlike you, am quite clear in my arguments, and have a direction and a goal. We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you "allow" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it!	You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about, and argue against that.If you want a (non-exhaustive list) seehttp://www.crystalinks.com/creation.htmlYou have simply picked one model, treated it as the only one, and constructed a (thus false) argument against it.
1	You know I actually considered that. Too much work, though. I have added to my list of things to do when I retire. That is, of course, assuming that we turned things around by then. If not, I will likely be too busy "holding the fort" against the hordes of starving yuppies.	Looks to me like its time to set things straight by writing your own book and name it " The Kansas Conspiracy Farce" by Daewoo :)
1	I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?	It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
1	Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be. These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone.	There is no possible way they could "accidentally" be so off the end result.

0	That just sounds alarmist to me. Do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights? It is just not going to happen.	I'm not saying being a lefty is bad, it's just that it seems some would throw away a right just to "feel" safe.
0	i'm going to presume that you are a christian. why are you a christian? because you happened to have been brought up in a christian family. why aren't you a hindu? because you weren't born in india. if you were born in india, you'd be a hindu. if you were born in central africa, you'd be believing in strange mountain gods.  use your brain, however reassuring and pleasant it is, god does not exist.  oh yeah, and why won't god heal amputees?	if you know a little bit, isn't it possible that in what you don't know, there is god?
1	dude, check my results. i'm shocked. i answered honestly. wow. you were def right, i aint no liberal. o.o	well... i guess no one can call you a rino.
1	Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.	Wow I think I may have won Hank's debate and the only proof you need is at dictionary.com
1	Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime? Or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander?	What price activist judges?
0	Logical truths do not come from "somewhere", your question makes as much sense as "What time is a moose?".You do not appear to have read my post at all, variously repeating what I have said and addressing things I did not say.	where do concepts come from when all that exist is matter, we know concepts are outside and are not dependent on matter or experence, or being discovered (if we did not discover them they would still exist)how can matter bring about something that is not matter
1	as to the first part, i answered you above. regarding the second part; what in the world are you talking about? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs? and boys born of virgin mothers? can you post any evidence of these cases? beside jesus of course, because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit.	and just to push your opinion a little further, if the soul enters the new being at fertilization, then does this mean that those girls (though very rare) who are born just from an unfertilized egg have no souls.
0	Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing.       Why didn't YOU cite them?	That is just a story of one person.
1	well there is an educated answer :) thanks for the feedback	There's no 'baby' to kill.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>..No
1	the liberal propoganda army is on the way? the man  must be lonesome!	i guess we are all still waiting in anticipation for the liberal calvary to arrive....
0	But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption.	If the "big bang" created matter than were did the stuff needed to make the "big bang" come from?
0	There is never a question of "killing people" in such circumstances, it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die, i.e. where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery.	Often, this debate becomes dotted with examples of things like human vegetables who might come out of their coma as potential people who aren't really people, or a person who was knocked out in a brawl as a potential person who is not (on some level) currently a person, and many other examples.
0	jito, i forgot to thank you for agreeing with me on eugenics. what is that?...the second or third time we have ever agreed? well, you have only 8,966 more things to agree on with me to show you have converted to proper thinking! emoticonxangel  consent is relevant when it is relevant. do you deny that women engaging in sexual intercourse (outside of rape or some other type of coercion) give consent to engage in an act that may result in pregnancy? i never said that sex was only for procreation and i don't believe it is. i do believe, however, that the procreative potential of sex must be respected. i do believe that when a being comes about as the result of a sexual act then that being should be respected.	and of course here you go wanting to meddle in the lives of others by telling all of us we only get to engage in sex for procreation.
0	Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.	then your argument too is flawed by the same principals of debate.
0	no, i completely agree. it's frustrating from a woman's point of view also. does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere, it's solely the woman's responsibility to take care of the child? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting.	i completely believe that fathers can be just as good parents as mothers, even better in some cases.
0	do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them? also you failed to address my point. is self-defense not a legitimate use for guns?	you can take them home, have them stolen and then used to commit a crime; or your son can take them to school and shoot a few dozens kids.
1	the nice part. i'm surprised that you've even read the bible. presumably you're commenting on 1 thessalonians 5:2, wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that.	:)  i am ready for judgment day..........as you know the bible says that death comes like a thief in the night.......well maybe your bible does not say that...sorry........
1	So if you were attacked by a 250 pound man who is an 8th Degree Blackbelt, you'd prefer a fair fight?	Also, a person has a change to run from those other things, admiittedly, a tossed rock can do damage, and if your opponent is especially hefty, a frying pan might fly a goodly distance, but it's the pure cowardly aspect of whipping out a gun that angers me, having a considerable advantage at a considerable distance.
1	Clue: It's there in your own sentence. Five letters, beginning and ending with "S". If you need further interpretive assistance, don't bother with Sarge, she's waiting for an original thought.	Perhaps you can demonstrate the link between swiss gun laws and a shooting in a swiss owned factory in missouri with an interpretive dance.
1	You can take a horse to water. I provided evidence to support my assertion. You provided ............ "Oh no it isn't!"	That's the front of the knee, what's that got to do with this argument.I've read the link, and just because it came out of Harvard doesn't mean that it's official or that it's of any measure of validity.
1	But religion is not a topic for science classes. Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative.	On the other side, you have the evolutionaist crowd, who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue.
1	you don't know? oh yeah... you're supposedly married to that teenager, prodigee.	who is dana and what does he have to do with whether these two countries are alike?
0	Well firstly we do not know that "volition" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.	My second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems, because a computer cannot model volition, the defining characteristic of life.
1	Therefore you accept that the Republican party almost as a whole is "grade A USDA approved Liberalism." About time you did.	First off, That's grade A USDA approved Liberalism in a nutshell.
0	Excuse me, but you didn't fully read what he wrote. He didn't say that he supported abortion. He said that he wasn't as much a freak about it as you're being.	You're automatically excommunicated if you support abortion and only can come back into the church via confession.
1	Oh, well, then that settles the argument doesn't it. It must be a person because she says so, now. Maybe she will change her mind again?	She now fights against the very abortion rights that her case aloud to make happen.http://www.illinoisrighttolife.org/2...cal_Impact.htm
0	why do you refuse to address the atf emails showing that they were building support for new authority to regulate and dictate firearms sales? they are truly right there, out in the open and viewable by literally everyone. why do you ignore them?	for those who think they can prove it: go ahead.

0	The same could be said of Clinton.Tell me. How do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations?If a person like Sanford isn't exposed to his own medicine, how will he (or others) not recognize how it tastes?Furthermore, I find your perspective a little baffling.What he said "many years ago"? Is that something he should be embarrassed of, because he was wrong?Or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught?Cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard. It's a good standard.We have too many politicians who look out for their own interests, and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously.	es' past (from many years ago in fact) in their faces when they mess up.
1	i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.	if you are looking for me to say that 'abortion is ok in some circumstances', i can't do that unequivocally.
1	We all agree that abortion is "killing". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open "mind". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead.	The shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life.
0	First of all, when gun owners say ban guns, it means, if you want to ban ANY Gun, you are a gun banner! You guys want to muck up the argument with we don't want to ban all guns, just some guns! However, that statement is just for now! If you get the ban more will be following!   Nelson T. 'Pete' Shields -- Founder of Handgun Control, Inc.	I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources
1	You know you have outwitted a conservative thinker when they completely dodge the argument you have made.	But if you can't even see that then there is no reason to even attempt to discuss it with you.
0	I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting.	BTW - I don't think hell is a place, either.
1	this particular one, formulated the way it is, might well fail. that's why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is.  where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from 'controversial' issues? ooooo... that's a persuasive legal argument. i'm impressed (not). gay people have been 'earning it' for over 100 years. in the short-term, we may suffer setbacks, in the long-term, there's no stopping us. another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue. no matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, republican-appointed judges. of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom.	if the lawsuit makes it to the scotus, it will go down in flames.
1	and you shouldn't forget the thousands of gays incinerated at this death camp!!!	Did you forget that?In a similar way, sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.
1	you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions. woopdee fucking doo. but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. well done darling. but being an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of years with not the rest of their lives. now let's get back to the facts - where in an arranged marriage does it say the 2 people getting arranged don't have a choice?	but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with.
0	Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.	You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence, I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods.'
0	How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child. And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law. So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that, there is no question.	But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women.The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it's often taken to establish that abortion is murder, and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly.
0	oh yes this is all over the news in ireland. irish farmers are having a canary that its the end of ireland's sugar industry. and cereal too because of crop rotation. nobody seems to have even thought of the question as to why exactly the eu should pay for an unsustainable industry as oppossed to farmers moving into something profitable. edit: oh and its tied into something about sugar being one of irelands few natural resources. emoticonxbanghead	hopefully we can get out of this pointless business of propping up our inefficient and pointless agricultural sector before this century is over.
1	is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james.	want the list of military actions he engaged in as president?
1	That was someone else you were posting to about them "hammering" porn, whatever that means.Gay men watch hetero porn and thats the reason for so much gayness? Real logical.	nd so strongly, at least this proves that I'm right about the porn hammering.
0	wow that's an excellent bit of knowledge. i didn't know that about the ps updates, i only had 1 and 2 and i felt like the hassle of continually buying a new one was not worth the free internet. also, as for the red ring of death on xbox, i guess i wasn't an extreme enough gamer to let mine over heat.	you have some major titles that xbox doesn't have like infamous, ratchet and clank series, uncharted, god of war, the last of us, sly 1,2,3,and 4, jack and daxter collection, killzone, heavy rain, resistance, and others that i can't name off the top of my head.
0	Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups.	The KKK use of firearms isn't a legal and lawful use, as dictated in the Heller ruling.Next argument please!
0	And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.	The point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro-gun side is very doubtful.
0	They have. Prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction, almost 360 degrees around. Predator animals have their both eyes facing forward.	)It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies.
0	Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example.	Why would a book be right about the lives and events recorded in it and wrong about origin.
0	We are on due process now? How can you evolve how you deal with due process? Due process simply means that processes which are required by law. The court evolved this into substantive due process which is changing the meaning of the constitution. Do you deny substantive due process?	Look, what I said was that the courts have evolved how they deal with due process.
0	That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed.	However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.
0	I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.	Why should they kill a human being in the womb, whether this human being is Arab or not?
0	You mean to tell me it's a falsehood??   I don't believe it.	from here  from here  there are more.
0	gay dreams are pretty common among men, but it doesn't make them gay erm.. you've had dreams about having sex with men? i think you're kidding yourself if you think that's normal for a straight guy.	gay dreams are pretty common among men, but it doesn't make them gay.
1	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.	Then it's okay to lump all Christians together!Evidently, that makes it all better!So much for being a free-thinker.But then again, you never addressed the issue I asked you about slavery.You claimed to be moral, based on democratic ideals of moarlity... but democracy would have very likely continued slavery in the USA!It was Christians who aimed higher.
1	So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage.	Here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry, supposedly in "defense" of "traditional marriage," when some of them are out sneaking around, cheating on their wives, and lying about it when confronted.
0	It's a lot more than what you've come up with. What evidence do you have that indicates the Iraq population wasn't heavily armed? As for the Taliban, you're confusing Afghanistan with Iraq.	Come back when you have something of substance.
0	Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves.	The facts speak for themselves, and no amount of geneticist/darwinist hand-waving is going to change what they say.
1	I guess we just haven't shaken all of our Imperialist ways. After all, we've only been away from the British Empire for a little over 200 years.:p	I thought the US government mostly engaged in killing young black men (or rather middle aged black men once the appeals process is over), not old people.
0	There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored. Those that haven't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about. There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred. Those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles, are dubious at best, and are extremely rare. A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens. The point I was making is that if they existed we would see them.	--------------------------------------------------------------------------How are we to know that there has not been a few hundred,there are none in my neighborhood,how aboput yours??

0	Yes. The better question is, did it happen just like in Genises? I don't think so.	if there is no evidence that adam and eve or eden ever existed, did man really ever commit a sin that caused all of mankind to be fallen?
0	obama has 1 thing that palin certainly doesn't have is the fantastic ability to turn crowds in favor of him. obama has amazing speech abilities that surpasses palin without a doubt in my mind. palin also likes to go off subject almost as if she is avoiding certain questions.  what is experience if you cannot even thoroughly explain your position?	but it's unfair to say she doesn't have enough experience when she certainly does (or, at least more than obama did).
1	'they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.' oh yeah, us liberals are free to talk on fox...  we just aren't allowed to defend ourselves when our statements are taken out of context, correct you when you misquote or misread soemthing for the benefit of your stance on a topic, or have the last word.... other than that, we may speak....	while i will admit that most of the people on fox news lean towards the right, they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.
1	Yep, suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go. We should also get them to stop pooping.	Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior.

0	And Atilla's army of as many as 1/2 million men was beaten and forced into retreat by the Romans and Visigoths in 451AD. A year later, he was forced to make peace after devastating the Roman countryside...but NOT Rome itself.He died a year later in 453AD.	Even in the case of the Romans, such practices as decimation eventually led to their downfall.

0	Not all evolution takes place over billions of years. There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time. "bacteria, birds etcs."Natural selection occures frequently. You can "observe" evolution through the fossile record, DNA, morphology etcs.Evolution has made predictions, these predictions have come true, ergo, it's good.	#1 - How are we now able to observe evolution, when the evolution of the world supposely took billions of years?
0	You don't even take into consideration the possibility that Japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the US- if guns were freely available in that country. You have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you're trying to peddle.	That has happened before even in Japan as well as other countries including here.
0	however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many.	how do you know for sure if the emotion you choose is correct?
0	It's one thing that stands between us and a mindless theocracy. It protects the freedom of women from would-be ayatollahs who would make them sexual slaves.	For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.

0	up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms.	morality, in the strictest sense of the word, deals with that which is innately regarded as right or wrong.
0	Oh, probably about as many as there are killed by bayonet lugs, pistol grips, heat shields, detachable magazines, and folding stocks.	I wonder how many are exaggerated.
1	wow, you're clever. and some things are dumb. ex, choosing to die when you have the option to live. your lame analogies aside, (yeah, i used the word lame again) one can find new people to hang out with. and again, instead of answering my arguement, you decide to try and insult me. you're right, i must be the one who is dumb...	something is only dumb to those that cannot comprehend.
1	Reading Difficulties, huh?  There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there.....	Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is "settled law" and the subsequent power to make it so?
1	my hat is off to california! was my post #43 right or wrong? now we just need new york to follow suit. now my question. if the federally funded programs can not create new stem cell lines, can california create them and then share? voila! federal funding on useful research. then watch 'em all stand in line for the cure. another question. has anybody else thought to ask gwb why, if stem cell research is false hope, did he fund any of it -- badly?	yeah, i heard they can get stem cells out of your teeth now.
0	Nothing "proves" evolution. However, there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that supports evolution.	Test hypothesis: (of course, all of the hundreds of complex studies known to prove evolution, most have been verified).
0	i am trying to become a going in to college for pre-med and i am shocked at the big decline in competion for such courses. not only has obamas healhcare programs overestimated the capability of our current amount of healthcare providers, but it is also deterring many from seeking such careers. by trying to help everyone in the short term, he is doing more damage to everyone in the long term.	i would be dead without healthcare.
0	is the legal aspect of it disputed or only whether it is immoral? i may be tooting my own horn, but this thread discussed the moral aspects of abortion in general, and this was my contribution. is that sort of what you're looking for?	i had to clear it with the theology department at my hs.

'guys' is the plural of 'guy'. you don't seem to be aware that the contraction for 'guy is' is 'guy's.' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor's is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the 'e' and 'd' keys. do you have a better explanation for our origins that doesn't involve magic and dirt?	these are people who believe it and worship evolution like their religion as long as they don't have to believe in a personal god.
0	do you realize, that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being. back when birth control first came out, planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle. so they redefined 'life' to say that you had to draw breth. by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies? 'cause they sure like humans to me. you know most of them can already move before the abotion? look into the court hearings of judge ricard c. caey in new york. if you want to know the truth about abortion.	how is it not, there is one defining moment in life: the fertilization, after that there is nothing were fingers snap and its a baby.
0	While the current cannon was 'accepted' by the late second century, there were numerous other 'gospels' that existed by then, and were eliminated at the 4th century time frame. Most of those copies were destroyed, but some have been unearthed.

0	For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care.

That's all.	Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.

0	But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.	Most evolutionists believe that matter and time were created by a "Big Bang."

0	I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them).	Waiting until they are born likely gives them no more chance of surviving than killing them in the womb.
1	I'm sorry, did Article V have a clause I'm missing that says you can only amendment the constitution if it accomplishes more freedom?

0	Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.	Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail.

1	I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.	The 1967 act "...allows termination of a pregnancy at any time if there is a significant risk of the baby being born seriously disabled.

0	Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.	Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?
1	Dont mind him, hes just sticking up for his new boyfriendemoticonXLove	Now, that is just plain cruel.
0	Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.	Do you not see how this could give the ILLUSION of evolution?

0	No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as "proof" of a young earth.	you might criticize me for believing evolution happened simply because scientists say it did, but alas, thats the reason why.

What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure.

0	Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there.	If you reject the literal account of the Creation in Genesis, you are saying that God is a liar!

0	Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by "higher" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.	It is just amazing that every creature on this planet didn't evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another.

0	So it is claimed.   Tiahrt Amendment Facts | ProtectPolice.org   I've noticed a pattern. Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so. They send a mixed message. It's happened before such as when the NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF. How can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better? It gives us a clue to what the gun lobby's true motives are. Truly disturbing.	tiahrt to holder: read the tiahrt amendment before drawing false conclusions
0	If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.	If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money.

0	Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.	I don't think there are many, who consider the fetus a person in the way you are implying, that are still for abortion "rights".The debate is not if its ok to kill a human being because obviously your not going to get a huge debate on that but rather is the fetus a human being.

1	human is defined by whether or not you have a funeral, included in the census, and pay something to the state? a homeless illegal alien is screwed.	if its alive then you should have a funeral for every miscariage, and you should include it in the census and pay accordingly to the state.
0	if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex.	the distinction can matter, so if there is going to be promiscuity going on, i for one would perfer to see it be safe-sex, as much as possible.
0	Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone "up there" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify.	My moral compass does not care if genesis is literally true or not.

0	Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent.	Everyone not a literalist can see that the two accounts conflict when read literally.
0	Well of course everybody is entitled. But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color, using the "black codes" enacted after the Civil War. If it weren't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution, minorities would still be out in the cold.The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment.	I think everyone is agreed that people no matter what race are entitled to equal protection under the law.

1	I've got a better compromise. We'll keep our magazines in whatever size we please, and we'll ban you, J Miro, Simone, and a random forum troll to be named later. That sounds fair and even in terms of trade to me.	How about a ban on J Miro in exchange for a ban on high cap mags?
0	But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).	then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of, in the worst case, chaos and, in the best case, a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority.
0	And the reasons have been discussed at length and most of us agree about the mother's life being endangered or possibly in cases of rape and incest.........Where we disagree with you is unecessary abortions...such as for birth control, a headache on just and inconveniencce........You think any abortion is alright...We don't.....	There are reasons women choose to abort and those need to be addressed and there will also be cases where women need to abort (health concerns, rape, etc.
0	Well, since you have natural selection completely wrong, it must not go too well with the Biblical account. By the way, now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context. What is a "kind." Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a "kind." Please show why a "kind" only has the ability to lose information.	variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.
1	What's your point? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density, so they can get around all they want.	A.
1	Where? I don't see it. My monkey brain's fine but my eyes aren't what they used to be.  I'm guessing we're through discussing the legality of armed self-defense in Australia given the flurry of OT links?	the other part about the gov't weapons finding their way into criminal and enemies of our country and the neighboring countries were thrown in to stimulate your little monkey mind.
1	So, is a giant Panda a bear? Or some other "kind"?	Sure, there are lots of kinds of bears, but they are still just that, bears.
0	Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.	But the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than that of criminals, thus less criminals will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person living there owning a gun.
1	lol...well why don't you use your brain and tell me how and why breasts formed then. why would they get selected for in the first place? ns can't see into the future. have any evidence of a reptile with breasts?	there are so many flaws and basic fundamental errors in reasoning here... i think my iq dropped an even 50 points just from reading it.
0	It's worse than that, Pandion. For example, here's what I told him over at ARN on the same subject back on April 5th. http://www.arn.org/ubbthreads/showfl...e#Post30331420	I'll leave it to you to search the peer reviewed literature for the several papers on the topic.
1	Just which god might that be? Yahweh? Krishna? he Great Spirit? Allah?  Please specify.	and the people who do that will have to answer to god in due time.
0	Why do conservatives support conservatives? Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas. Luke doesn't have him meet a risen Jesus only Paul says he did. His first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with Barnabas.But the Apostles did not teach the same as Paul, similiar but not the same.	It is not necessary that all the apostles should be equally inspired to only write teachings and letters like Paul, just like all the organs of a body do not take part of the same the function, but the nevertheless, all contribute to the making and building of the body.
0	And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?	I'm not sure what you mean.
0	When the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable.	As rights of only one of two are being considered.
1	archie, that wasn't a prophecy you neo marxist socialist, it was a hope. neo, marxist socialist, eh? three compliments in the same sentence. see you can be nice if you really really try. nice to know i am continuing the proud tradition that my parents established so many years ago. my father voted for debs, and my mother voted for foster. archie, sweetie, your flattery will get you nowhere, try as you might.	that wasn't a prophecy you neo marxist socialist, it was a hope.
1	i disagree with it because there is no god. these are your words: 'i propose that a standard of good or evil cannot be defined by humans or human constructs.' i guess i shouldnt be surprised that i cant get a straight answer. you dont know. i am surprised your 'god' has not provided you with more adaquate ansures.	i submit that you think it is 'too easy' just because you disagree with it.
0	Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called "womens issuses" be in valid?	Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.
1	I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?	8.I just love how Liberals like to twist this to mean that it's the government's responsibility to care for us via food (food stamps), income (welfare checks), Medicaid/Medicare/S-Chip, etc.
0	it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.	can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally (without going through selection) validates darwinism, which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted?
0	there's a fair few problems with this. off the top of my head... what happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child? what consequences would there be for a mother who didn't want to give the name of the father? would there be any? why is only the father punished? having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people. if it isn't consensual, rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs, why punish only one of the consenting individuals? on a more fundamental level: what evidence do you have that having an abortion is 'a mortal sin'? why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept?	will it fly with conservatives and progressives?
0	Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality.	You are in a loud minority, railing against the irrational hoards about you.
0	So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?  Your statement "An abortion never has to be done" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?	Mr. Jack, Abortion doesn't have to be done if the amniotic sack is cut.
1	Only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakicetus_(1).jpg  Replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why I put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy.	but when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater.
0	It's still not right for religious people to have to never speak their beliefs. It's a form of tyranny.	And just specifically what parts are those?Mr.
0	when i was in high school lots of the kids stole stuff all the time... stuff their parents didn't want to buy them, peer pressure etc. i'm not trying to be an ass either i'm just surprised at your views on this...  maybe i'll make a debate and we can see what people on here think.	i don't think lindsay lohan is a good example of any group of people... when i was younger i worked in retail and thieves were everywhere... they just stole because they wanted stuff they couldn't afford.
1	Let's see now....you're Christophobic, Biblephobic, Fundie-phobic, steeped in carnal hedonism, you use derogatory rhetoric against God's people, and what else?Hypocrite!!And Barney Franks a respectable congressman? ROTFLOL!!!!You're clueless, Shooter. I shutter to think where you'll wind up. But we'll have to see what develops. It'll probably be negative, since you've lost your focus.	EasyRider, you truly are a man of God.
1	Jyoshu, stop drinking the Kool-Aid before your brain is totally fried.	It just goes to show double-standards.And Arizona, with it's REAL governor who stands up to the feds, is a state many others only WISH they could be.
1	About a third of the weapons seized in Mexico were referred to the U.S. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   About half were successfully traced. Better than 90% of those to U.S. dealers.   Of course your definition of "minute" might differ from mine.	The lie that was purported based on successful traces of the minute number of weapons Mexico turned over to be traced and identified, while keeping the vast majority from law enforcement?
1	are you one of the hard of understanding people? flyboy got it, even if his rationalisations were insufficient. even so, they were far superior to much of the dross you regurgitate.	or are you one of those 'the holocaust never took place' people?
0	please clarify what you're saying here as it makes no sense to me. what point are you trying to make ? off the top though, any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible doesn't condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act/lifestyle. and who does the anti-defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it.	you don't think we could find denizens of stormfront who would claim that they don't hate black people but they think it is sinful for white and black people to have relationships, and then point to, say, the anti-defamation league and accuse them of hatred?
0	I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.	I suspect, therefore, that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy.
1	This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)	A union between two persons having the customary but usually not the legal force of marriage: a same-sex marriage.
0	So atheism doesn't "need" facts? If it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution, doesn't it need all the facts? If the answer is no, then how can it argue against religion? Miller didn't explain it.	Religion= faith in a deity or deities (rough definition)  Atheism= lack of religion/deities  Therefore, atheism= lack of faith    There is no "faithful" beginning point of atheism.
0	You JUST said they get health care in the hospital! Read your post, where's there NO healthcare. And it IS based on the ability to pay...you just want me to pay for someone else's and in the most inefficient way possible.	We already have the cruelest form of rationing in the world, that which is based on the ability to pay.In LA, if you're rich, you get Cedar-Sinai.
0	I think this is a bad way to put it...the evidence that they earth has been warming since we have had the ability to measure temperature is overwhelming...the cause is unknown and whether or not it is natural is unknown. It does seem fairly narasistic to think in 100 years we have caused so much damage to an earth that at least has been here 10,000 years.	The evidence on global warming, however, is pretty overwhelming.
0	It's all in how you word the questions.You worded the questions with an obvious bias, they did not come across as an honest attempt to learn, but rather as a challenge.Word them properly, and I guarantee you that the people here will be most helpful.WaxyP.S. Your username has a large affect on how you are initially perceived.	It really piques me when someone attempts to assume what my opinion is without asking me.
0	Well, if you breed them, you could get taller monkeys with less hair (and other humanlike characteristics). Even so, it would take a long time.	In fact, the only feasible way that a tree-swinging monkey could change into a man would be through some freak accident (aka -- random mutations.)
1	i love how you are using violence to threaten people. when, your argument is disputing violence.	disagree with this and i'm going to beat the crap out of you.
0	Kronus said this was a win for science. He never mentioned that religion was discredited- never mentioned religion at all. Religion and science are utterly unrelated. Why would you make that connection?	When religion is discredited, is it a "win" for science?
0	The point is that there are plenty of issues that go on in church meetings and denominational conventions that are areas of enormous disagreeement and struggle. It happens--it's not just this issue. You just don't hear about them because the press isn't interested in those issues.	It "isn't controversial" because the vast majority of Christian sects HAVE NO PROBLEM with it.
0	Strawman. The argument is not to do whatever one wishes with ones body. The argument is soley that one does not have to have another attached, ever, against ones will.	The simple fact is, in a civilized society no one has the freedom to do whatever she wants with her own body.
0	Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.	You may not have intended to, but you've given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes, with regards to her family - and you'd stick out of it, regardless.
0	Yes. The assumption happens to be that maybe the bible isn't literal. "Lets look into ourselves, shall we?" Behold we did, and Lo! The Earth is old!	Like most other natural history museums today, the Museum of the Earth takes visitors on a journey through time, telling as fact “the 4.6 billion year history of the Earth.” But visitors will never get an opportunity to check the assumptions at the foundation of this story.

0	Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.	(Playing devil's advocate)And, by what authority would you deny a woman's "right to choose" an abortion that happens to be "late in her pregnancy?"
0	One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord.	They simply cannot figure out why so many missionaries go over to China and try to convert people.
0	And were THIS the 17th century, I might understand that, but this is the 21st century. We don't "bleed" people to make them well; we don't have barbers performing surgery and we usually have a trained physician in the delivery room.	This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth."
0	Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today.	"http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.htmlThis is quite clearly wrong as Darwin did use it in the 6th ed of Species.
1	Did you even notice that they were not the first to report it? Oh wait, you didn't because you are obviously using the fallacy of selective observation.	Newsweek should be punished by the World Court for inciting riots and causing deaths with a fraudulent story.
1	fend not really. they took it out because it was a blatant pro-christian argument.  and those two threads only serve to prove my point. the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims. there is no science in id. only godiddit.  explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong.  explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution, it's false. that makes no sense whatsoever.  explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted. or are all these products science brought us fake?  the delusion of creation.	both long and religious (in its own context).
1	Well with thinking challenged individuals like slimjim floating around it is no wonder we have a rogue agency with no oversight attacking the honest citizens. See Ruby Ridge and Waco for examples.	http://www.jpfo.org/docs/atf_1979.txt after reading hundreds of horror stories about these type of incidents it is not hard to see that ATF hasn't changed it's focus and goals any.
1	I guess I am just "psychologically conditioned" to be blue eyed.?	so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist?
0	You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.	And would society break down if some individuals are allowed to enter into a legally protecting penumbra institution we call marriage?
0	And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.Mo	I just say we make a law against abortion, and stop the genocide against the unborn.
1	How about the pass that the Clintonistas routinely gave to Bubba for his Oval Orifice tryst with Monica??	Or did you make that up so you could attack me since you have no argument?
1	shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such.	the government should only deal with 'civil unions', regardless of the gender of the individuals involved.
1	wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again.	get over it

1	i'm shocked! how could hunter mislead me so? emoticonxrolleyes given his previous output, i have to confess that i'm not at all surprised that this was a garbage in, garbage out moment. i feel slightly embarrassed at not stopping to consider the preposterous nature of a 14% figure though emoticonxembarrassed	however, it is more easily understood as: (pop a)x.06=(pop b)x.44 (pop b)/(pop a)=.06/.44=.1364=13.64% one should remember, too, that (pop b) is still part of (pop a).
1	Oh, I agree....private security companies are the answer. Very republican of you.	Surely, in high schools and colleges there could be found several Batman types who would be proud to protect the general public from mentally deranged gunmen by carrying one himself...just in case.If it would save a bunch of lives by having a quick way to snuff out random shooters, I'd be all for an extra tax to cover it...and I hate taxes.
0	what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny.	i can't live in an assisted living center with my partner if/when that time should come, without marriage.
0	no, but i went over there and checked and i guess by time stamp you were first. ;)	have you been reading my posts in the other debate?
1	Get away? We never went near it in the first place.	hard to face the facts, i know... cant seem to get away from the fact that 3 babies die every second because of abortion.
0	truth can be found in god. we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not. for instance, one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone doesn't believe it how true is it? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math. 1 + 1 is 2, 12 inches equal a foot, etc. the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is.	truth can be both subjective & objective bryers choclate chip ice cream is the best in the world.
1	i'll agree with you on some of the things you said, but not the hired gun. america doesn't need to hire guns, we have our own. if what you are asserting is the case, then why would we be where we are right now. and are you saying that israel gets there weapons for free? this is america son, nothing is free if you haven't found out. and our strong ties with israel are more than likely due to the fact that they're more trustworthy than any of the arab nations, thus making a greater ally.	israel, as by far the single largest recipient of us military aid, direct financial aid and trade loan guarantees is the only one that comes to mind.
0	have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution.	personally i don't give rats rear end about your god - neither he, you, the government or the ignoramous in rome will ever have say in what happens to this body.
1	wow, in your very warped world view, people with moral values that defend the most defenseless among us and speak for those who can't speak for themselves are seen as morally perverted by you? how terribly pathetic of you capo. but sadly, i'm not the least bit surprised at how incredibly shallow your perspective is. what boggles the mind though is that you're unable to empathize with a whole class of human beings whom you once were yourself. just think about it capo, can you see what that say's about you?	the individual's right to control her own body, have security of her own person, cannot be imposed upon.

I would really appreciate it if you guys could include some extra informations regarding this issue.	You would probably get much more out of it if you posted a question here, let people reply, then carry on in a similar way asking questions (even related to replies) and getting reponses.
0	And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.	I won't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal didn't even exist.
1	what about god? so many god-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :) seriously i really don't know much about terrorists. i know that bin laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it.	simply crazy, and scary when you think about it.
1	'lame apologetics'? well, i guess if you say so, with your invincible assurance of being right whenever you open your mouth, it would be futile to contradict you.  at least you haven't accused me of being 'prejudiced' against science.  james.	nowhere are you able to defend christianity marching against the heathen.
1	Then why does god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in Hosea 13:16.What did they ever do to god?Does god fear these people so much he has to have unborn members of their community killed. Un born members who couldn't have possibly done anything to god!	We really are going around in circles on this........My bible through the RCC and Jesus Christ says all life is sacred including that life in the womb.........
0	Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior. Abstinence until marriage is still the best way.	Wait a minute, I fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not.
0	But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done.	That does not mean, however, that we should refrain out of politeness from making statements of established scientific fact just because a listener might have been exposed to contradictory religious beliefs.
0	ridiculous. if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong. daewoo: ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind. id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. it failed. michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic.	(the two points being cases where the video indicates that iders try to use ic to prove id) all i said is that they cannot.
1	fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. that is you doing the same damn thing, hypocrite.	did you ever wonder why you have such a low disapproval rating in your debates with many so people on this site?

0	Folding proteins... Show me where and how this happens. Why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another? If this is happening all the time we'd see more mutations all the time.Good theory you've got there. Saying something can happen doesn't mean that it does!	Another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins.
1	Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbor's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competance.	Now, you're advocating that this is what God should do.
1	Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?	In your other posts it was a "baby" CUNx.
