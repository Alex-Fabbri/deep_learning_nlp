Vcare to guess on which side you fall ? good question . let us say that dawkins is my teacher . in the ben stien interview , dawkins said that evolution is fact , as much of a fact , as we can know anything to be a fact ... ok ? ! ? ! dawkins also says that we do not know how life originates from inornanic , nonliving compounds and he says , that , he does n't know and no one else does either . ok ! ! ? ! well i do not accept that as an explanation - so - i guess i am not blindly following this irrational line of logic . i would have to say that - i am not being 'indoctinated ' . at the same time , dawkins has nothing to teach me so i guess i am not being 'educated ' either . hmmm . i guess i would have to say that in this case i am - neither .

'' but the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which , it seems , can not be interpreted away . that part that condemns homosexuality is accurate , straight-from-gods-mouth truth . again , why the dichotomy ? why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation , but others are rigid ?

( you do know what i 'm talking about , do n't you calli ? you do know what a `` point mutation '' is , do n't you ? ) bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers . a single point mutation produces feathers from scales . various kinds of feathers require only further mutation .

Vif minorities ' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives , then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system . and the risk to minority 's civil rights is , of course , the reason for the bill . they are , after all , limiting what can be started via initiative , not eliminating the initiative process altogether . the fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed . as has been argued here before , if civil rights need protecting , it 's from the majority . allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it 's will on the minority . that 's not what a democracy is about , at least not our democracy .

V1989 , the berlin wall came a-tumbling down , along with soviet ideology.communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it . of course the bolshevik revolution was doomed from the start as russia was not indsutrialised and the revolution was imposed by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat ( not that there was a proletariat in russia at the time ) .

Vregardless , we have yet to see any evolution of new body parts or its so called `` steps '' if evolutionists want to suggest that a few decades is too little time why would that even be expected ? when you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations , obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock . and yet , there are frequent observed mutations . in fact , my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations . one fly had no wings and white eyes .

V'imposing religion ' is not the same as using religion as a basis , and it 's the fact that you are wrong on this that 's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change , just as equally as anything else . except several rligious organizations around the country have financed , and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot . they have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman . they have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people . any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people . in short i have been barred from marrying the person i love because someone else , that i do not know and who does not know me , has some sick religious belief .

Vwrong again , christianity is definately exclusive ( john 14:6 ) jesus did say 'come ' but it must be on his terms ( repentance ) ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works ( 2:10 ) . i must admit that im not totally sure what this means , that faith leads to good works ? id dispute that . whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith , romans 2:6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds . in the end , the point is moot . i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone ( and it doesnt conclusively ) , my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway .

' origins of science , whether truly started by those of faith or not , is irrelevant . whatever science was , it has become a body of knowledge , through application of reason .

Vfor example , when you have a healthy marriage , children will generally model themselves after their parents ( disclaimer note i said 'generally ' there are exceptions , however disclaimer ) . why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact ? i am not talking about parenting . i do n't advocate forcing anyone to parent . ever . that is why i support safe haven laws , signing away of parental rights , etc . i am talking about pregnancy . only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is . it is her body , not your 's , not the state 's , not the church 's , and not the fetus ' . when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women . i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent .

Vshould modern science be able to prove without the shadow of a doubt that man evolved from amoeba , reptiles , animal life into what he is today , orthodox theology would be able to make the transitional acceptance far more readily than western theology for all the reasons stated above . if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation ( i , e. , six days , man from dust , fruit of good and evil ) then what is its use ? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated , or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical ? genesis 1 & 2 , in the literal application , has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without : 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises . now if genesis has it wrong , then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible ? from all scientific perspective , genesis 1 & 2 never happened , and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned .
