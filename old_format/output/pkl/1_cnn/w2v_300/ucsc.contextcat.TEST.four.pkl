Vits because it feels pain.. this is after 18 weeks.this is a child in the womb.. the vast majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester . when they are performed in the second trimester it 's a serious procedure for the mother to go through , and is something she obviously would n't go into lightly . her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else , and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it . basically what i 'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she 'd been raped , or was going through something you ca n't understand . for an abortion that late she 'd have to deliver the foetus anyway , which is traumatising enough .

Vanti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society , believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone , rather than being offered an easy way out , they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage . i think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion , they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition . in many cases it 's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed . disagree or not , you ca n't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder .

Vits difficult to merge life in its purest form with science , even though science 's purpose is to study life . that 's not true -- actually , it does n't make sense . science is just a bunch of rules ( by definition ) . `` biology uses science to study life '' is true . `` physics uses science to study the physical world '' is true , but `` science 's purpose is to study life '' is not true .

Vi think this paragraph should answer your questions thoroughly . true until proven otherwise eh ? xcaliber and you must get along great.you have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory ' , that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.no logician ( and by extension no good scientist ) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.oh right theories are never proven , so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this - > 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true ' .

( with iraq or terror here or whatever ) how much $ $ $ will he throw at the economic crisis ? what will the outcome be ? anything you all want to predict or comment on concerning the upcoming presidency will be appreciated . have fun !

Vthese things do exist and i did n't think it necessary to cite peer reviewed material on such trivial matters . wikipedia is really quite amazing actually . you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it . that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors . but , there are millions of contributors . each going over and correcting information supplied by others . in my mind ( given the current number of users ) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information .

Vhttp : //www.youdebate.com/debates/gun_registration.htm no , gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the us . the government has no business knowing who has a gun . gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the bill of rights . just knowing that there are many senators and congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd amendment in the future . p.s . crazy is as crazy says . scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun . which , if later found , would then be traced back to the legitimate owner , who may not even know the gun had been stolen . the alibi better be outstanding !

Vso this is a chance for you to work on debating skills . i think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to . every person ( with some exceptions ) has the right to keep and bear arms , why you do it is your own business . giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms . while i have specific reasons for owning specific guns , to include hunting , i own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot . a humorus side note : i own one gun strictly for fishing , sounds odd but its common practice ( at least in alaska ) to shoot large halibut before bringing them aboard .

Vlike i said we can not solve all the worlds problems , we just need to be there for others less fortunate than ourselves . so would n't that cover almost all of africa ? there are so many people dying in the city streets of hunger in our own country , yet we elect a president who wants to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country ? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves , we would be helping africa a lot more than we are now ( their average life expectancy is like 30 ) . yes iraq was terrible , but guess what , other countries might think our country is terrible . that is not our concern and at least we could wait until we fixed all of our own problems first . we have poor hungry starving people on the streets of the us and we go to another country to solve their problems ?

Vrovdak , are you forgetting that ivf and cloning technologies are abortive technologies ? so much bs ... where should i start ? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations . since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations ? if a woman wants to maximize her life , liberty , and happiness , and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy , your intended prevention of that action 'flies in the face of the declaration of independence ' ... ( not that the declaration has any legal standing . ) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant . no thing , human or not , has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter 's consent .

Vin short , i think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact : a person who is brain-dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given , whereas an embryo who is `` brain-dead '' most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone . what you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important . i would personally also thinking that potential existence is important , but not nearly as important as an existing person . after all , unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss . for many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important . for both the 'braniac '' case you present and for the early term fetus , if there is no reason to kill it , then do n't . however , if there is a contest between the rights of a living , existing person and the rights of either *potential* person , then i think the rights of the living person win out .

Vover time , very short time , the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions . are you sure ? what about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair . such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone .

Vhey , answer the question : is there any possible information you could ever recieve that would weaken your belief in god ? ' reckon you 'll be eating your own words in due time , moose . not from what i 've seen so far in your posts . keep plugging , though , you may find god yet when you run out of all those ill-conceived arguments against him .

Vdescribed as being unknowable ( which you have said your god is ) . it is disappointing that you would continue with this mistake . i said that god is both knowable and unknowable . you simply think that equates to the same thing , and thus you argue against what you believe i say , rather than what i said .

Vyes , you can see the difference , but what is that difference ? you mean other than the fact that mr. pocketwatch and mrs. pocketwatch do n't meet up for a night of whoopee and end up with little baby pocketwatches some time later ? how about : i know that humans manufacture pocketwatches .

Vbecause the earth is older than 10,000 years as many creationists think and the 7 day creation does n't make sense . but does n't genesis imply that creation occured in one 7-day period ( though the days could be symbollic ) ?

Vit is a standard which we hold no other group to , just as we should not hold it to same-sex couples . i disagree . well , only in that i think it 's high time we held everybody to a higher standard . we should suspend hetero marriage until they clean up their act !

Vps for an aussie , your english is quite good and i agree with some of your positions . lol , what did you mean by that ? i 'm not sure , and dont want to assume the tone you infer with . i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify . ps ; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper ' , although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does ' . @ simone , no worries hun : )

Vthat is all without going into the political comentary about conditions between the various cultures at the time . that 's not what the bible says . you 're playing word games . what next ? numerology ? ? ? i mean , i can play around with interpreting too . i can take 'roses are red , violets are blue ' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to . let 's see , roses represent love , and red is the color of blood . a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers , and blue means sad . so what 'roses are red , violets are blue ' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful , and people with 'small things ' are sad ' . bet you never knew that 's what it was really saying !

Vi 'm not going quite that distance : i 'm saying that moral values are expressions of approval/disapproval that do n't arise from rational deliberation , but from the affective part of human nature . fine . thank you . what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus . how do you define the moral consensus ? in attilas case , would that be among the huns ? among the hun ruling elite ? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he ( for the sake of argument ) has no intimate knowledge ? now why should he act in accordance with the consensus ? this is not completely clear to me . so , do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned ?
